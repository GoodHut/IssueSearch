 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/maker.js/issues/291" TITLE : questions: dxf import BODY : @danmarshall i'm working on the dxf import into openjscad.org, as we want to be able to import/export all supported formats. it seems that you have browsed around autocad far more than i have, and i have a few questions. - are there default color mappings? it seems that dxf just has a number, but it would be nice to map this to something useful. - is there a variable that contains the 'unit' for a drawing? i will default to milimeter but it certainly would be nice to know how the units are passed between applications. any other tips?
