 URL : "https://github.com/mpirnat/dndme/issues/29" TITLE : add & remove npcs BODY : sometimes one or more npcs might join the party for a while. if we don't want to assume that they just hang back and never participate in combat, we should work out a way to add them to the party and remove them when they're done. this entails modeling them somehow in toml and object representation like other forms of combatant , figuring out how to organize them on disk to load, loading them, and removing them.
