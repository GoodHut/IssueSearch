 URL : "https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/22887" TITLE : embedding include cleanup BODY : the julia embedding include directory should be cleaned up. it has a couple of potential issues right now: 1. poor include guard names: the embedding interface header files have very guard names like utils_h . if other projects also use generic names, then they can conflict. prefixing each guard name with julia_ would fix this problem. 2. polluting the include namespace: julia-config.jl generates $julia_home/include/julia as an include directory. the user then uses include <julia.h> to embed julia. the problem is that this directory contains a lot of files that the user doesn't need to import and that will conflict with other libraries for example include <uv.h> . ideally julia-config.jl would generate $julia_home/include as the include directory and the user would type include <julia/julia.h> to embed julia. i would be happy to submit patches for both these issues if they would be accepted.
