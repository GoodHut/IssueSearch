 URL : "https://github.com/xenforo-ltd/docs/issues/25" TITLE : add-on built, what's next? BODY : suggestion, if not already planned, would be to include a section after the building the add-on section to actually test that it uninstalls and installs successfully, thereby verifying that setup.php works. would it entail uninstalling the add-on that we just finished developing, then reinstalling from the release package we just produced? do you clone your dev environment and attempt a clean install and uninstall there? or is there a recommended workflow to achieve this?
