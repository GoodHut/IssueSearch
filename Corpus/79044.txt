 URL : "https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/5600" TITLE : restore install progress BODY : recent versions of conda show download progress but do not show any indication either that the install has started, or how far it has progressed. especially on windows vms, e.g. where the install portion can take several minutes, this makes it appear as tho conda has simply frozen/hung/crashed, which can be quite frustrating. please restore the install progress status indicator.
