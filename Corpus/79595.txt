 URL : "https://github.com/zerojay/RetroPie-Extra/issues/254" TITLE : solarus & zelda fangames BODY : there is already a script in retropie-setup to install solarus , but from files, not git source code, and it's outdated. solaris v1.4.5 i have work on it, and compile five solarus games, and modify them to fix the analogic pad problem, and the hability to exit game to es with the menu, with controller, and not esc on keyboard. these function will be add in the future on the official release, but not immediately. maybe i can upload my files and we can make them install from bin. using git source is possible too but will take most work because you must patch some files. these zelda are really fantastic. now with solarus 1.5.3 or dev 1.6.0 an some new games come ... i f you want to work on them to add them for every one, i can help you and give my compiled files.
