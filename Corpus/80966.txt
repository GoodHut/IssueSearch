 URL : "https://github.com/autograde/aguis/issues/13" TITLE : userview refactor needed BODY : the <userview> could handle all variations of user listings, with various conditionals to display needed buttons and so forth, instead of having the teacherpage.tsx handle pendingusers and so on. also the icoursestudent should be renamed to icourseuser and reflect also teacher state in the coursestudentstate . this will allow using a switch to display different buttons easily. i also want to rename admin to course manager to more clearly distinguish it from a system admin.
