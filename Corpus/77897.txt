 URL : "https://github.com/Exslims/MercuryTrade/issues/46" TITLE : option for always on top BODY : would it be possible to add an option for the overlay to stay active even when you tab out of the game? i play on 2 monitors and i kinda dislike not seeing the notifications ui while i'm doing something on the other monitor. this would probably benefit quite a lot of people.
