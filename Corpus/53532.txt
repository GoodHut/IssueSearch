 URL : "https://github.com/nrc-cnrc/EGSnrc/issues/277" TITLE : eadl relaxations issue BODY : in the new release of egsnrc the eadl atomic relaxations is enabled set to true by default, on the contrary of what is written in the documentation: egsnrc core manual , page 157. moreover, with a very simple montecarlo e.g. photon of 1 mev with ecut=0.512 mev and pcut=0.001 mev in an infinite region is possible to demonstrate that the total energy deposited in the material does not correspond to the energy of the starting particle. in other words, if we set in the ausgab routine: etot = etot + edep with iarg=0,1,2,3,4 , the final obtained value for etot range from 1.000 mev to about 1.005 mev when eadl relaxation is enabled, while etot give the correct value of 1.0000 mev when eadl is disable setted to .false. . is this an expected behaviour?
