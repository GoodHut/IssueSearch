 URL : "https://github.com/daid/LegacyCura/issues/1558" TITLE : cura layers not printing BODY : hi, my model in cura 14.07, had 914 layers. i saved it to gcode to go into my anet a8 via sd card. the print stopped early, and when checking the gcode file back in cura it only had 595 layers. i am very new a few days to 3d printing, so im hoping there is something in a setting somewhere that i've missed. any help would be appreciated.
