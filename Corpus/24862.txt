 URL : "https://github.com/IBM-MIL/CognitiveConcierge/issues/20" TITLE : tutorial is flawed BODY : trying to follow along in the tutorial: https://github.com/ibm-mil/cognitiveconcierge step: 4. once the project is cloned, open up the .xcodeproj file that was created for you in ict under local server repository. edit the sources/restaurant-recommendations/main.swift file's constants struct with your own google api key for web. can't edit 'main.swift' because it doesn't exist. how can the tutorial be this far off? it looks like there was an update a few days ago to the code.... don't they cross-check code updates to the actual tutorial so that they are in sync ? very frustrating and disappointing. :
