 URL : "https://github.com/contiki-os/contiki/issues/2299" TITLE : ip routing trouble BODY : hello. i am using the 6lbr border router and a sensor is sending data to an external address. i need the border router to forward the message to an external address. in the code the ip stack tries to forward the message to an address with a null lladdr. in the function nbr_table_add_lladdr, we do: _if lladdr == null { lladdr = &linkaddr_null; }_ and then _if index = index_from_lladdr lladdr == -1 {_ index_from_lladdr does exactly the same test so we never consider the external address and add it to the neighbor queue. this lead to a full neighbor queue. i think the code should be changed to _if lladdr == null { lladdr = &linkaddr_null; } else if index = index_from_lladdr lladdr == -1 {_ ... what do you think about this proposal?
