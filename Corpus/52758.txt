 URL : "https://github.com/AnemoneLabs/unmessage/issues/63" TITLE : create a crypto module BODY : one part of the crypto used in peer comes from pyaxo and another part comes directly from pynacl. additionally, other modules in unmessage are importing from them as well packets , untalk , etc and this might cause problems in the future. i think we should create a crypto module that imports from these dependencies and offer an api for unmessage's own modules.
