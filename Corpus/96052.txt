 URL : "https://github.com/JeffersonLab/clas12-offline-software/issues/1" TITLE : duplicate geometry classes BODY : @drewkenjo i just noticed that some geometry classes exist twice in this repository. for example /common-tools/clas-geometry/src/main/java/org/jlab/detector/geant4/dcgeant4factory.java and /common-tools/clas-jcsg/src/main/java/org/jlab/detector/geant4/v2/dcgeant4factory.java. could you remove any geometry stuff that is deprecated?
