 URL : "https://github.com/WolverinDEV/BungeeUtil/issues/20" TITLE : repository url missing BODY : in the wiki you specify a dependency, but you didn't specify the repository url. therefore since it doesn't seem to be in the default repos used by maven , the build fails because the dependency can't be found. could you add the repo url to the wiki description?
