 URL : "https://github.com/WarEmu/WarBugs/issues/8865" TITLE : tok unlock 'indigestion' BODY : this bestiary unlock should be triggered by : - interacting with 'drul's lunch' in black crag 500 20k inside 'the despair pits' - killing 'skittering spiders' at the north of this cave, to get a 'poison gland' - interacting again with 'drul's lunch' 'poison gland' correctly drops on 'skittering spiders', but interacting with 'drul's lunch' does not provide the unlock.
