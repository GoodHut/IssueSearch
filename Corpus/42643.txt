 URL : "https://github.com/typora/typora-issues/issues/497" TITLE : bug in url processing BODY : i noticed a bug in url processing. i specifically noticed mishandling the ~ character, but i suspect the general url regex is probably buggy. to recreate, simply write or paste a url into typora, in wysiwyg mode, that includes ~ character. the entire url should be recognized as a url, but url recognition breaks at the ~ character. screenshot: <img width= 398 alt= screen shot 2017-01-18 at 8 28 02 am src= https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796356/22065852/10c52f14-dd58-11e6-8d80-48962a4bddcc.png >
