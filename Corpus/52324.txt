 URL : "https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium-php/issues/117" TITLE : checklist for bundling BODY : a random collection of todos not everything has to necessarily happen before we bundle : @jedisct1 should request a php account and commit karma at least for ext/sodium, maybe general iirc the plan was to drop sodium_hex2bin and sodium_bin2hex in favor of hex2bin and bin2hex . however, the php implementations should be made timing-safe first. the big reindent. php-src uses tabs, while this repo uses spaces. i think for this library it would be good to switch to zend_parse_parameters_throw, such that invalid arguments result in an exception rather than a warning. a number of functions seem to have incorrect arginfo. would be good to review this and make sure eveything is correct. general api review. after this is released in 7.2 it will be very hard to change existing function signatures, so any changes should happen now. anything else missing?
