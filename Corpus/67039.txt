 URL : "https://github.com/squarefeet/ShaderParticleEngine/issues/125" TITLE : only 1st group updating BODY : hi squarefeet! first off: awesome library, been using it for a while and i love it : unfortunately, i have recently encountered an issue where only the first spe.group instance created is updated / rendered. i have a fire function class with _this.group_ and _this.emitter_ set to a new group and emitter, respectively. whenever this is called, it adds the _this_ object to a global array, where all fire instances can be updated in my render loop. it works fine with one fire instance; however, when i try to add more only the first is updated. i know or at least am quite certain it is not a problem with the array approach, as i am using this technique for a variety of other implementations and they all work quite nicely. to specify, by not updating i mean the particles will still appear, and then disappear when their maxage is reached with new ones replacing them; however, any _velocity_ or _acceleration_ values are not considered; the particles just stay stationary. not sure if this a problem with the library itself or my code... any help is appreciated. thanks! three.js r87 chrome v63 beta
