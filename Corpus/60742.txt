 URL : "https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/3649" TITLE : add docker health check BODY : dockerfile allow you to declare healthcheck https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/ healthcheck command. it would be great to add this command to the docker image, and report zap as healthy when it complete loading. this could be useful when using zap in ci environment using docker-compose , and waiting to zap to complete loading before starting the tests. the only problem is how we detect that zap complete loading - i think the api is responsive before zap complete loading.
