 URL : "https://github.com/epoupon/fileshelter/issues/25" TITLE : remove max hits feature BODY : it seems that the max hits feature is more annoying than useful: - people ignore that a value of 0 means unlimited downloads, and they rather put very high values like 10k+ - people often set a value that is too low, and it makes the link consumers to ask again for the file - extra field used in the creation panel i think it would be easier to remove simply remove this setting.
