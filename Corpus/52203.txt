 URL : "https://github.com/jsevellec/cassandra-unit/issues/240" TITLE : cassandra unit wrapper BODY : hello all, i've made a wrapper, been using it for a few years now, that wraps cassandra unit. main feature is a port picker that makes it possible to run several cu-builds on a build server without getting port conflicts. it is also very easy to setup a test by extending one of the classes, that will give the developer an instance running by default. you find cassandra-testbase here https://github.com/svenakela/cassandra-testbase
