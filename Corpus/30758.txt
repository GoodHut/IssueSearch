 URL : "https://github.com/FredericHeem/starhackit/issues/297" TITLE : quick start on os x BODY : hey frederic, thank you very much for this starter kit. i want to achieve a quick start on os x and it doesn't seem this kit is ready out of the box to make this easy. i did 'npm install' in client and server. don't want to use ansible for dev. server/config/default.json has commented out sections, json doesn't support comments. 'npm start' seems to work with expected errors about redis. what is the minimum i need to do to get running in dev, or ideally getting this starter into a state that it can be quick run? happy to do forks/pulls but i'm using it to get a simple db app up and running asap. i had to comment out 'prestart' script in package.json as the eslint is complaining about globs: enoent: no such file or directory, realpath '/users/timshnaider/desktop/development/react/starhackit/server/src/ / .js' error: enoent: no such file or directory, realpath '/users/timshnaider/desktop/development/react/starhackit/server/src/ / .js' at error native at object.realpathsync fs.js:1568:18 at /users/timshnaider/desktop/development/react/starhackit/server/node_modules/eslint/lib/util/glob-util.js:159:24 at array.foreach native at object.listfilestoprocess /users/timshnaider/desktop/development/react/starhackit/server/node_modules/eslint/lib/util/glob-util.js:153:18 at cliengine.executeonfiles /users/timshnaider/desktop/development/react/starhackit/server/node_modules/eslint/lib/cli-engine.js:702:35 at object.execute /users/timshnaider/desktop/development/react/starhackit/server/node_modules/eslint/lib/cli.js:174:107 at object.<anonymous> /users/timshnaider/desktop/development/react/starhackit/server/node_modules/eslint/bin/eslint.js:76:28 at module._compile module.js:541:32 at object.module._extensions..js module.js:550:10
