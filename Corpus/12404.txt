 URL : "https://github.com/WebReflection/node-worker/issues/1" TITLE : parallel or nah? BODY : i read this in the docs: > note: using the timeout or breakonsigint options will result in new event loops and corresponding threads being started, which have a non-zero performance overhead. i scanned the code and i didn't see either setting in createsandbox . is there something else happening to ensure parallel processing? or do all the vm's share a thread? thanks for highlighting a use case for this api.
