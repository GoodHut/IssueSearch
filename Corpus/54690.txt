 URL : "https://github.com/santigarcor/laratrust/issues/85" TITLE : hasrole returns false. BODY : hey everyone! i recently installed laratrust on my system for roles and permission management. i seeded the tables with my required roles and permissions, inserted 1 record under role_user table manually where user is me and role is administrator. when i get the user using $user = user::with 'roles' ->find 1 ; i get the user, with the roles. but if i do something like, $user = user::find 1 ; $role = role::find 1 ; $user->hasrole $role ; -> returns false, where as the user already has the role. what is going wrong here? also in the signup controller, i have $user = new user $request->all ; $user->attachrole $roleid ; this returns an error saying only one argument was passed, the role id, user id is missing. any help would be appreciated.
