 URL : "https://github.com/catmaid/catpy/issues/3" TITLE : scope of the library BODY : hello! great to see the catpy library online - i think it will become useful to a lot of people. how do you see the scope of the library? would you want to have it purely as an access library to the catmaid api or do you envision also more sophisticated contributions for analysis single neuron, circuits and visualization? if the latter is the case, i would be happy to contribute some of the things i wrote during my phd partly in the cat package and elsewhere and i believe this would be the right place to do so. however, it will be necessary to have a good basis data structure to represent skeletons, connectors, circuits including attributes on the nodes and edges, metadata etc. to build on top. for my purposes, i built this myself, mostly based on networkx graphs or numpy matrices, but it would make much more sense to have this standardized and ready-to-use for people getting started with novel analysis, and also to reduce duplication of programming efforts. i know there were talks about this earlier and i know about the repo by @ceesem https://github.com/ceesem/catpy also doing that. i am happy to contribute my insights to such a discussion if this is of interest here.
