 URL : "https://github.com/mhuebert/maria/issues/29" TITLE : save to gist BODY : if the user is logged in to github it would be great if they could save the current buffer to a gist. if the code was loaded from a gist, i would expect to save back to that gist like save functionality in a local editor ; otherwise, it would just generate a new gist with the contents of the current editor.
