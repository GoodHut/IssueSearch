 URL : "https://github.com/capaulson/pyKriging/issues/27" TITLE : option to specify path BODY : first of all, thank you for your package! apart from 2 issues i found of which this is one , everything works very well! i was getting a ioerror when generating an optimal lhc sampling plan using the samplingplan class, because it was trying to write the lhc pickled cache to its installation directory i'm running anaconda2 on windows , to which i didn't have writing rights. i think that in general it can be assumed, especially for large corporate system architectures, that python has no admin rights and thus cannot write to the installation directory of the package. it would be nice if the path could be supplied as a parameter to the __init__ function to solve this issue.
