 URL : "https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/issues/472" TITLE : isochrone api bug? BODY : 2017-01-20t03:19:18z @araichev : originally created valhalla/thor 546 2017-01-20t14:38:22z @dnesbitt61 : we will update documentation. use_ferry is documented for auto costing so you can reference its meaning here. as for ferry being a transit mode, we get most ferries from osm without schedules so routes of any type not just multimodal will generally use them. we may revisit this in the future when there are enough ferries with schedules obtained via gtfs imports.
