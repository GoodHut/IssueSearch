 URL : "https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/3279" TITLE : enhancement merging decks BODY : i thought about this feature for quite a while now but since the new deck export feature has been added by blizzard i feel like that it would be even more useful. because it quite often happens that you change your deck without that the decktracker tracked thhe change. if you then import the deck back into hearthstone with the code even with the same name the decktracker creates a new deck. so it would be great if the tracker doesn't merge the new version automatically to the old one as a new version to merge two decks and select the current version so that i can keep the stats of the deck while making changes on a differen t device etc..
