 URL : "https://github.com/Bioconductor/bioc_docker/issues/14" TITLE : core ms container BODY : @sneumann - as far as i understand, specifying metabolomics and proteomics biocviews in the config file https://github.com/phnmnl/bioc_docker/blob/master/config.yml l32-l36 is going to pull all packages that have these tags. i think we should specify a limited number of core ms packages; i would suggest we start with - protgenerics - mzr - msdata experiment package and then progressively add anything that would be relevant for the metabolomics and proteomics containers.
