 URL : "https://github.com/anishathalye/gavel/issues/47" TITLE : support a hosted version BODY : right now, there's no hosted version of gavel. if someone wants to use the system, they have to run their own server or use heroku - this requires some level of technical sophistication. it could be neat to modify the system to allow for a hosted version and then we could have a default hosted version that people could use if they don't want to run their own . this would involve adding user organizer accounts and stuff and then supporting multiple events running at the same time , setting up a system where people can create events at eventname.<domain> or <domain>/event , and a bunch of other changes like this. this would probably be a pretty substantial project.
