 URL : "https://github.com/lagom/lagom/issues/667" TITLE : offset tracking grouping BODY : currently lagom's apis that do offset tracking read side processors and topic publishers persist the offset of every message. this is not a bad default, especially for read side processors, as it allows exactly once processing. but exactly once processing isn't always necessary, and the performance cost could be high. so we should offer a configuration option to specify grouping, so that, for example, the offset can be configured to only be persisted every 10 events.
