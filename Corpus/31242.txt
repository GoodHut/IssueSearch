 URL : "https://github.com/postmodern/gem_home/issues/16" TITLE : script gem_home fix BODY : in the gem_home.sh file we see one particular line in gem_home_push , in line 3: mkdir -p $1 && pushd $1 >/dev/null || return 1 this will try to create the dir for the new $gem_home if this not exists, and if exists, 'fails silently'. this is related to issues 7 and 9. i think that gem_home must not try to create the project dir for the $gem_home if not exists, if this happens must fail. with this the script will be more clean and avoid the problems mentioned in the issues mentioned above.
