 URL : "https://github.com/EdwardRaff/JSAT/issues/63" TITLE : bug in the arffloader BODY : while loading an arff file, there's a bug with the naming of numeric variables: line 199: there is no need to use the helper variable k. simple example: the list variablenames contains a , b , c . a is a categorical variable. inside your loop, you check if the variable is numeric, so in the first iteration no name will be set, i will be 1 and k is 0. in the second iteration you use k to get name. normally this should be b , but because k is 0, you will get a , which is wrong. so just remove k and use i and everything will be fine.
