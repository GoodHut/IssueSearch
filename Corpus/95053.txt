 URL : "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/9695" TITLE : convert a tensor to matrix BODY : hi, output of first layer cnn , if input was a image with size 100,150 then the output layer is a tensor 1,100,150,32 for slicing the first image from all 32 output images, i used this code: conv1 = tf.layers.conv2d image, filters=32, kernel_size= 5, 5 , padding= same , activation=tf.nn.relu >>conv1 is tensor 1, 100, 150 ,32 first_image=slice conv1, 0,0,0,0 , 1, 100, 152, 1 >>first_image is tensor 1, 100 ,150 , 1 has the tensorflow a command for convert a tensor to 2-d matrix directly ?, or how can convert a tensor to matrix in tensorflow?
