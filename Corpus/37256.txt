 URL : "https://github.com/BowlerHatLLC/feathers/issues/1645" TITLE : list item layout bug BODY : i've noticed a list item renderer layout bug that occurs when the data source is an array containing only null values: var collection:listcollection = this.list.dataprovider as listcollection; collection.removeall ; collection.push null ; in such a situation, my item renderer's anchor layout does not behave correctly, and the controls on the item renderer are misaligned. you can view this issue using the attached sample code. use main.mxml as the document class. notice that when you press the single null item button, the list item renderer's controls are misaligned vertically. list item layout bug.zip https://github.com/bowlerhatllc/feathers/files/1389705/list.item.layout.bug.zip tested with air 27, starling 2.1, feathers sdk 3.3.1
