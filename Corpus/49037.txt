 URL : "https://github.com/pldin601/Fluorite.js/issues/1" TITLE : support eager loading BODY : awesome lib. very simple yet powerful. i think eager loading is the only thing missing for my usecase. const thing = await thing.objects.get 3 ; const user = await thing.user .one ; expect user.id .tobe 2 ; it would be nice to get the user for a given thing in a single query via eager loading. i'm not sure what the api might look like for this.
