BODY : tango tek brought me here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e4oh5aihfy&list=plngkfxwfvstg4koqfedwhvw5eok4kcj9v&index=23 . i have a question about something i am unclear on. -does every client require the jar if it's installed server-side? -in order to use this on a server, do i put the designated .dat files into the server config folder, or my client config folder? -if it is client side, do i need to periodically download and refresh the .dat files from the server, or will the .dat files automatically download new versions when something changes?
