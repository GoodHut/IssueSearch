BODY : just downloaded this and i'm trying to figure out how to activate regex mode fo, say, the path. i have a path: \foo.css?12345 where the number is random which i'd like to replace. it'd be nice to have a 'use regex' checkbox that would parse the path as regex. but, without this, how do i activate regex for paths like this?
