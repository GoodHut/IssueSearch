 URL : "https://github.com/cloud-security-research/sgx-kms/issues/1" TITLE : server verify ias BODY : when we use server_verify_ias, barbican server will send quote to ias for getting attestation report. right now, the client only did verify_certificate and verify_signature , but i think there are more steps to do. the content of attestation should be checked as well， is that right ？
