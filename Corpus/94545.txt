 URL : "https://github.com/datahq/datahub-cli/issues/217" TITLE : cat sheet option for excel BODY : as a wrangler i want to cat a particular sheet of an excel file not just the first one so that i can use that sheet or inspect different sheets when deciding what to do data cat excel-file just results in cat-ing of the first sheet which is a good default . but often first sheet is just metadata e.g. data cat https://www.bis.org/statistics/pp/pp_detailed.xlsx or i just want to see other sheets. in these cases i want to be able to specify a sheet other than the first to cat.
