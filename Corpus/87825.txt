 URL : "https://github.com/ganeti/ganeti/issues/383" TITLE : master failover over rapi BODY : originally reported of google code with id 327. master failovers need to be done manually via ssh to a candidate node. it would be nice to be able to promote a master candidate via rapi if the current master is unreachable. per previous discussion with iustin, a brief proposal: - ganeti will be changed so that the rapi daemon is listening on all master candidates, not only on the master node - on a master candidate, rapi will respond with an http redirect to the current master node for all current calls - a new rapi resource will be added which will allow promoting the current master candidate to master, if the prerequisites allow it, similar to gnt-cluster master-failover it would be even nicer if there were a way to tell the cluster to do a master failover without needing to know which node s were candidates. originally added on 2012-12-05 15:28:17 +0000 utc.
