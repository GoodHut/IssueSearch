 URL : "https://github.com/docopt/docopt.c/issues/39" TITLE : generate header file BODY : i think this would be a little more convenient to use if it generated a header file with just docoptargs and docopt . the use case for this would be a program that deals with parsed arguments in many places. if the parsed arguments docoptargs are needed in different files, we can't just do include docopt.c like in the main file. we would instead have to re-define the struct in each file that the parsed arguments are needed.
