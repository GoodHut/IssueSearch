 URL : "https://github.com/open-guides/og-aws/issues/512" TITLE : potential 'news' section BODY : we talked about this last year, but with re:invent looming, i wanted to re-open this topic for discussion. should we have a 'news' section? i would see that product announcements that we are interested in could be highlighted here. also i think that 'reporting from re:invent' would be useful - maybe in the same section? other opinions?
