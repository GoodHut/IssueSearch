 URL : "https://github.com/redux-offline-team/redux-offline/issues/129" TITLE : action not being triggered BODY : i am just beginning to implement this library. i am fairly new to redux also, so it may be as simple as an error with how i am creating my store. i get this warning on store rehydration > redux-persist/autorehydrate: 1 actions were fired before rehydration completed. this can be a symptom of a race > condition where the rehydrate action may overwrite the previously affected state. consider running these actions > after rehydration: > object 0: objectpayload: objecttype: offline/status_changed __proto__: objectlength: 1__proto__: array 0 my store creation code is const store = createstore reducers, compose applymiddleware thunk , offline offlineconfig , autorehydrate { log: true } , window.devtoolsextension ? window.devtoolsextension : f => f and my action looks like export const submitcalllog = dispatchid, calllog => dispatch, getstate => { type: submit_call_log , payload: { dispatchid, calllog }, meta: { offline: { effect: { url: urls.save_call_logs, method: post , headers: { content-type : application/json , accept: application/json , cache-control : no-cache , authorization: token + getstate .auth.servertoken }, body: json.stringify { call_logs: calllog } }, commit: { type: call_log_submit_success }, rollback: { type: call_log_submit_failure } } } } however, when i call submitcalllog, i no longer see any action has been dispatched in the dev tools, and nothing seems to happen. have i done something wrong to set this up?
