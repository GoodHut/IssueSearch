 URL : "https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-sysadmin/issues/107" TITLE : tighten tls settings BODY : bouncer.ooni.io https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=bouncer.ooni.io and some other api endpoints are not pfs-enabled, chrome is upset saying > _the connection to this site uses an obsolete protocol tls 1.0 , an obsolete key exchange rsa , and an obsolete cipher aes_128_cbc with hmac-sha1 ._ it may be improved, but i mark it as low-priority as afaik no confidential data is transmitted to ooni, so the only benefit from tls is integrity.
