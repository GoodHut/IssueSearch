 URL : "https://github.com/radar/just/issues/1" TITLE : port to another language BODY : i feel like ruby is probably a heavy-handed language to write this in, but it's what i'm most comfortable in and i wanted to get it done quickly so that's what it's written in. go might be a better choice, on reflection. then you wouldn't need ruby installed to run this command. i'd be happy for someone to port this codebase to go and for that to become the mainline codebase. i know go. patches welcome.
