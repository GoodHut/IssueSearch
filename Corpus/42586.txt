 URL : "https://github.com/YahnisElsts/plugin-update-checker/issues/98" TITLE : broken link in readme BODY : hey there, there is a broken link in your readme documentation wich i'd like to see fixed : its this part: this is a minimal example that leaves out optional fields. see this table https://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=0aqp80e74ycuwdedetxzlcxhjd2w0chmwx2u1edlwthc&authkey=ck7h9tok&hl=en&single=true&gid=0&output=html for a full list of supported fields and their descriptions. also noticed an error when having wp_debug on true. it appears sometimes saying unidentified index 1 in the file readme-parser.php. mabye because i don't use a readme file? thanks in advance
