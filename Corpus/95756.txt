 URL : "https://github.com/artlogic/nabs/issues/1" TITLE : discussion strategy change BODY : sorry for taking so long in providing feedback. i like the idea of breaking out the command from the package.json file as they can become long and difficult to read; and really ugly to comment. however, it feels a little weird to me to have a source file nabs.yml that exists to make changes to package.json . the reason, i think, that it feels weird to me is because when you make changes to the nabs.yml file you also must remember to run the conversion for package.json as well. i've been thinking about this a little bit. my, two, suggestions for thought exploration are: 1. is there a way to capture npm run ... calls and do something with nabs before, after, or instead of letting npm do its work? if so this might be a better solution. 2. if the first option isn't possible, maybe register the tasks in the package.json script directives and have them simply execute nabs tasks . 3. if you are ok with a global package executable however you could skip the package.json completely imho. i personally avoid installing any npm modules globally as a rule. i've even thought about setting up my shell to include $ cwd /node_modules/.bin/ to my path so that i can install modules locally but use them as if they were global.
