 URL : "https://github.com/koekeishiya/chunkwm/issues/15" TITLE : features goal vs kwm BODY : i consider kwm a proof of concept; figuring out how much we can customize macos to personalize our experience and increase productivity. i must say that i'm satisfied with how that project went and what it was able to achieve. despite the problems that currently exist, i feel like it was quite a success. a lot of these shortcomings should be sorted out in chunkwm , thanks to the experience gained during the development of kwm . my point is that i'd like to start a discussion of features that people find interesting and may want to try and achieve on macos. thus, i am very much interested in knowing about which features that kwm has the idea, rather than the specific implementation that you think are good, bad, a waste of time or just plain useless. other features that have not been tried in kwm or otherwise are also very welcome.
