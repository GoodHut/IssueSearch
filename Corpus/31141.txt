 URL : "https://github.com/Knewton/edm2016/issues/2" TITLE : running without tox BODY : hi there, i'm very interested in implementing irt; this repo seems to be well-suited to what i am to achieve. however, i find it very difficult to play around with the code when i have to continuously run the command tox after any changes. what would be the best approach to achieve the same results without using tox? what files should i individually run? thanks
