 URL : "https://github.com/smirarab/binning/issues/3" TITLE : garli input trees BODY : i'm currently trying to use trees generated in garli but they aren't being parsed correctly by dendropy. this seems to me like it could be a quick fix, either by converting them into a form that looks like the output of raxml, or by tweaking some of the code in 'remove_edges_from_tree.py script. do you have any suggestions for how to deal with this issue? i've attached an example of an output file from garli for reference. best, ian ml.best.tre.txt https://github.com/smirarab/binning/files/843218/ml.best.tre.txt
