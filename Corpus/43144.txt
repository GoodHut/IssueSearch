 URL : "https://github.com/chrmarti/testissues/issues/7755" TITLE : code formatter option BODY : in full visual studio there is a really neat formatter option: insert space before opening brace and after closing brace any kind of brace, square, regular or curly . i cannot find the same in vscode. i it is the only feature that i'm missing right now in vscode. or is there such an option already? should not be tied to a particular language, but my interest is in javascript.
