 URL : "https://github.com/robotology/QA/issues/258" TITLE : yarp tcp vs. fast_tcp BODY : today, during a discussion about yarp network protocols, some of us discovered that the tcp is actually the standard tcp + an ack with yarp , while the fast_tcp is actually the standard tcp protocol. is it the case? if that so, why aren't they called, respectively, yarp_tcp and tcp ? finally, the tcp documentation http://www.yarp.it/carrier_config.html carrier_config_tcp and fast_tcp http://www.yarp.it/carrier_config.html carrier_config_fast_tcp documentation seems to say something different. cc @pattacini @randaz81 @vtikha @barbalberto @lornat75 @drdanz @nicogene
