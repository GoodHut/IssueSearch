 URL : "https://github.com/superphy/backend/issues/258" TITLE : could not create blastdb BODY : of the 3155 files in the first batch, we get roughly 20 which qc reports it can't create a blastdb for. not sure what's going on, originally thought it was related to file names though perhaps it has to do with the tempfile usage. some examples. sh ec27486.fasta 201700106.fasta ers799794.gff.fasta escherichia_coli_gw_uti_002.fasta bsc14.fasta ec28033.fasta link: https://sentry.io/share/issue/17b2545cdcaa4e2b964f61a5a767e246/
