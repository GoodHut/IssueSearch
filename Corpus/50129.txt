 URL : "https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/issues/3280" TITLE : vrhelper usage issues BODY : lewis pointed out a couple issues: •	if you disconnect & reconnect the controllers while in vr, the teleportation no longer works. •	the helper will always creates a new deviceorientationcamera, which is used when not in vr. it would be great if you could provide an option such that the developer could choose to use provide their own camera rather than the experience helper creating one; o	alternatively, move the onexitingvr observable to after you set the active camera, so that the developer re-apply a custom camera on vr exit?
