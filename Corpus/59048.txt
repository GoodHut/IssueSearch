 URL : "https://github.com/ScreepsOCS/screeps.behaviour-action-pattern/issues/1176" TITLE : task queued validation BODY : currently our tasks don't ever validate their 'queued' list of creeps, so if for some reason they get removed from the spawn queue, the task will get stuck in a bad state. we need to have some kind of validation from time to time to ensure we can recover from this.
