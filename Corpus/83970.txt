 URL : "https://github.com/AllTheMods/ATM-2/issues/53" TITLE : connection lost timed out BODY : our atm2 server has an issue where sometimes we try to log in, and we see a couple chunks and then nothing else loads, and about 10-15 seconds later we get timed out: ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/196978/28638740-c42c0686-7213-11e7-9d6a-2299b0c6cfec.png after this, our server thinks the user is still logged in for at least several minutes. used to be more like 30-40 minutes, until i optimized mekanism latest version has my optimizations, highly recommend updating it in the next pack release . today i finally was able to have the profiler running while i had the issue, so here's the dump of the reason behind that long delay: ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/196978/28638756-d2cd70f8-7213-11e7-9f75-2a78565a460e.png atm2 pack version 0.73, i have updated mekanism to latest with the improved performance fixes . will be an ongoing thread until we get to the bottom of this. my next steps include looking at that method source to see if the removeall calls are obvious; probably taking a memory dump as early as possible in this bug next time i repro it; possibly hook a debugger and step through the method. but i figured it was time to open this thread now that i have a foothold.
