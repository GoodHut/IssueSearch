 URL : "https://github.com/joshualat/Pluralize.swift/issues/21" TITLE : can i use it for swift 4? BODY : hi, i would like to use this for swift 4. i have included the pluralize framework in my project. changed the deployment target to 10.12 since it is my main project deployment project. git clone https://github.com/joshualat/pluralize.swift.git inside your project folder i have done the steps: drag the pluralize.xcodeproj file into the file navigator of your project. ensure that the deployment target of pluralize.framework matches that of the application target. in your targetâ€™s build phases, add pluralize to the target dependencies build phase. add the appropriate pluralize.framework product to the link binary with libraries build phase. add the same pluralize.framework to a copy files build phase with a frameworks destination. i have tried both import pluralize_swift and import pluralize. but it has showed me that the module is not found. is this because i cannot use swift 4 for pluralize framework you build? thank you, gemma
