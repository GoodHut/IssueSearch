 URL : "https://github.com/jrbudda/minecrift/issues/273" TITLE : start location waayy off BODY : i'm seeing a bug in vivecraft that i cannot reproduce in normal minecraft: when i first enter the game, my start location is very different than when i last left the game. several hundreds blocks. always in the same direction north northwest. for me, this dumps me in the middle of the ocean every time, which is obviously super annoying.
