 URL : "https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri/issues/2025" TITLE : make sidebar pluggable BODY : summary currently we hard code which urls we expose in the main navigation sidebar. given that we have a plugin driven architecture, this is suboptimal, because only plugins that correspond to our anticipated plugin manifest will ever be exposed through the sidebar. this also makes it difficult to implement the kind of suggestion made by @indirectlylit https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri/issues/1914 issuecomment-318434198 to implement a more material design style navigation system. it is proposed that the sidebar be made pluggable for the following purposes: - bootstrapping spa endpoints from the django backend, to populate the main sidebar navigation items like 'learn', 'coach' etc. this would require the backend to supply properties such as: display name internationalized on the backend , an identifier label. it would also require the design of some sort of ordering system, either based on 'priority' i.e. how close to the top it should be , or 'preference' where in the nav bar does it want to sit? . the latter system seems preferable to include the preference for appearing below the divider bar in the side nav. in either system, tie breaking could be delegated to alphabetical sorting on the label. - spas on the frontend registering their sub navigation items to be displayed under their top level nav link on the sidebar.
