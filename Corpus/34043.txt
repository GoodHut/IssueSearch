 URL : "https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/7553" TITLE : breaks firebase apps BODY : adguard with default setting breaks all firebase web apps because firebase sdk a very popular app development platform by google, if you didn’t already know is being blocked from this url among others https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/4.6.0/firebase.js of course, i could whitelist it on my end or host the sdk myself, but it still breaks any app built on firebase including official documentation examples and tutorials all over the web for a vast majority of users who use the hosted sdk from google also, while you’re at it, please consider removing onesignal sdk https://cdn.onesignal.com/sdks/onesignalsdk.js from your filters since it’s a very legitimate push notification service used by thousands of websites that needs the user’s consent to allow and manage push notifications id: 1659762
