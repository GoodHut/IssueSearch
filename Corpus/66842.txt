 URL : "https://github.com/hmhrex/Tenma/issues/29" TITLE : no way to delete comics BODY : i renamed some comics, because of the names conflicting with other comics, now when i importer tenma has duplicate comics, one with the old file name and one with the new. there seems to be no way in the ui or wiki to remove certain comics or comics with files missing, or even just remove everything and start over .
