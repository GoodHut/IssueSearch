 URL : "https://github.com/Nischay-Pro/manga-notifier/issues/5" TITLE : add url from current tab BODY : provide an additional browser action that lets users add the currently active tab's url to the list of urls in the settings. so there needs to be another option above settings that says add url . a suitable icon should be added as well the way to go about it would be to use the tabs api specifically activetab and getting the url of the current tab. then use browser.storage.local.get to read the current list of urls, append the current url to the list and then browser.storage.local.set to complete the addition.
