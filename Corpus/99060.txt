 URL : "https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki/issues/335" TITLE : make auto_export asynchron BODY : the auto_export config key is pretty useful, but when i have a pretty long page, it always takes a couple of pretty annoying seconds to save, and this drives me crazy. so i was wondering if it's possible to run it asynchron? or is it possible to trigger the vimwiki2html command or even vimwikiall2html outside of vim? i could think of a file watcher that runs a certain command when something has changed.
