 URL : "https://github.com/OpendataCH/Transport/issues/170" TITLE : connections from lat/lon? BODY : i'm trying to use this api with a little app that gets the current location in lat/lon and a destination in lat/lon and gets the public transportation options between them. the location endpoint supports lat/lon, but near as i can figure out, connections endpoint only supports stations and addresses? i can't even enter 8942 oberrieden as an address i get a null , i have to go down to the street level. my workaround is to geocode each lat/lon into the nearest street address, format it in a way the api accepts addresses, and send them. i'm sure the server just geocodes it back again, but i don't see another option. am i missing something in the api? is there no way to specify from/to in coordinates?
