 URL : "https://github.com/roundhouse/FormBuilder-2-Craft-CMS/issues/122" TITLE : feature add in. BODY : hi there, i know you added the custom field back after requests, but why did you not just add a global template select? where a person can just create his templates with fields and just assign that global theme? when it is empty it just uses the generic theme. please let me know if you would do anything like this.
