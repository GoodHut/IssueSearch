 URL : "https://github.com/gisma/link2GI/issues/4" TITLE : suppress console output BODY : hello, i am very grateful for the function of the packages :- however, is there a possibility to hide the console output of the functions? i.e. using link2gi::linkgrass7 i get some warnings... i already tried invisible , suppressmessages and sink but it did not work. the warnings are still at the console. in rgrass7::... there is the function parameter sys_show.output.on.console=false which can do this job. but, i cannot access it from the functions at the moment.
