 URL : "https://github.com/Signbank/FinSL-signbank/issues/230" TITLE : webfont for handforms BODY : this was requested by leena. this is a low priority thing at the moment and might not make into the first official release. add some webfont that includes 'sign language' handforms ? . this font would be used to add different kind of 'handform notations ? ' to glosses. - find such a webfont that is opensource and can be added in the project. - figure out a way for easy input of these fonts. - perhaps a list from which a user can choose from.
