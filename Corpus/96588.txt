 URL : "https://github.com/Inist-CNRS/lodex/issues/303" TITLE : facet selection impossible BODY : using https://github.com/inist-cnrs/lodex-use-cases/tree/master/users data and model , i connected as an admin julia and went to ontology tab to make email a facet. back to the ressource, add a facet button appeard, as expected. clicking on email opened an input field. great. the placeholder is select a value for: email , but no value is selectable. one can type a value, but the enter key does not actually select it even if it is present in the dataset . no auto-completion fires either.
