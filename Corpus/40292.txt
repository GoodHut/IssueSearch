 URL : "https://github.com/cyclejs/cyclejs/issues/585" TITLE : total http isolation BODY : <!-- have a question? ask us on gitter https://gitter.im/cyclejs/cyclejs . found a bug? please fill out the sections below. give enough details and be polite when writing in text. thanks! --> code to reproduce the issue: no code, yet. maybe soon. but for now, i'll just say that it is totally reasonable to isolate a component in terms of http. for example, i'm making a github button component. it makes some github api requests. the point is that it uses the response itself, alone. no other component is interested in that response. i would like to completely isolate it, therefore. expected behavior: should be able to isolate http components completely. actual behavior: only siblings isolation is possible. versions of packages used: @cycle/http@13.2.0
