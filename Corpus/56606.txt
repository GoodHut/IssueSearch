 URL : "https://github.com/poeapp/poeapp/issues/65" TITLE : no other mods checkbox BODY : the idea is to search for items with only selected mods and nothing else. for example i want to look for 3-mod jewels from like 10 mods - so i put those 10 mods, select count min 3 max 3 - normally i would get the list of jewels with those 3 mods without or with another mod, but i want to select no other mods and filter out everything that isn't on my mod list.
