 URL : "https://github.com/alexhallam/TensorFlow-Survival-Analysis/issues/2" TITLE : predict path issue BODY : i found that it doesn't load model for some reason. maybe it's windows specific? a quick fix change path checking in predict function from: assert os.path.exists self.params.modelpath to assert os.path.exists self.params.modelpath.split / , 1 0 but when i try to predict after training, ds_tf = deepsurv_tf.deepsurvtf params stats = ds_tf.train train, valid ds_tf.predict valid 'x' the follow error occur: --> 291 risk = sess.run risk , feed_dict = {self.x : testxdata} unboundlocalerror: local variable 'risk' referenced before assignment
