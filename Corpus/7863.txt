 URL : "https://github.com/carl1to/Cop-It-Supreme-Bot/issues/6" TITLE : key words error BODY : i was trying out the bots keyword tool for the first time just on some unsold items on the current drop. therefore keywords are an exact match i tried this with multiple different items , but when i hit start on the bot it only takes me to the category page and thus i get the error without the bot adding anything to cart. i hope the screenshot helps to provide context. <img width= 1275 alt= screen shot 2017-08-24 at 11 42 16 pm src= https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31337104/29702489-62fb8ae2-8926-11e7-8de5-2bc357687c75.png >
