 URL : "https://github.com/elieserdejesus/JamTaba/issues/828" TITLE : looper space bar behavior BODY : at the moment the space bar works as a play/stop shortcut after you pressed play. but if you press record it works as a rec/play toolge button. i think it should be fixed to be the shortcut of only one of the two behaviors record would be my personal preference .
