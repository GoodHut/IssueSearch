 URL : "https://github.com/rhodricusack/automaticanalysis/issues/97" TITLE : remove deprecated modules BODY : going through aa_modules, there are more than a few that are no longer supported and which no longer work . two examples would be aamod_firstlevel_modelspecify and aamod_autoidentifyseries. to avoid confusion for new users, it would be better if these were removed in the next release. if we ever want to repair them and bring them back they remain available in the git version history of course. if you know of any other modules that are probably no longer supported, maybe let us know in comments and we can do a big cleanup commit once we've converged.
