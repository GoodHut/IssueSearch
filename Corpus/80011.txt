 URL : "https://github.com/sfackler/rust-postgres/issues/227" TITLE : support serde_json 0.9.x BODY : currently the project supports a maximum of serde_json < 0.9. 0.9 has some sweet features like javascript-style field accessors, and i use rust-postgres in a lib of mine so i can't upgrade til we support 0.9 in rust-postgres. i cloned this repo and the project builds fine against serde_json 0.9, but tests won't run without some refactoring. would the best approach be to enforce a required serde_json of >= 0.9 for the next release of rust-postgres, or would you prefer to have some sort of cfg check in the test to allow for versions of serde_json <= 0.9 to still link against rust-postgres?
