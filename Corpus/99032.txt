 URL : "https://github.com/react-native-sensors/react-native-sensors/issues/24" TITLE : magnetometer not supported BODY : hello, i'd like to point out that the magnetometer is not supported. using it as a decorator will have no effect, and using it explicitly will throw the following error when instanciated: undefined is not an object evaluating 'api.setupdateinterval' i tried to fix it, but it appears that the native implementation is still to be coded. my suggestion for now is to remove the magnetometer from the exposed api and the readme.md in order to avoid leading users into believing it supported. i'd be happy to make a pr for this.
