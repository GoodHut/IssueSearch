 URL : "https://github.com/technosophos/helm-template/issues/4" TITLE : release name support BODY : it would be useful if helm-template would support a parameter for release-name. most charts have a parameter that depends on release name but i see in the code that helm-template uses a standard release-name replacement. thanks!
