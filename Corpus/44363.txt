 URL : "https://github.com/jbdemonte/mongoose-elasticsearch-xp/issues/26" TITLE : es_extend and promise BODY : would it be possible to support promises with es_extend's value? i would like to add related document count with a query like: { es_extend: { commentcount: { es_type: 'integer', es_value: document => mongoose.models.comments .count { 'post.id': document._id } .exec , }, }, }, reason for this is that i would like show comment count along the post list. also, i'm interested if there is a better way to achieve the same end result.
