 URL : "https://github.com/LillyanPan/AttritionAnalysis/issues/3" TITLE : james chen - peer review BODY : the purpose of this project is to create a model that can be used to detect whether an employee is going to leave their company based on factors like number of previous jobs, pay, education levels, etc. the dataset used is the ibm hr analytics employee attrition & performance dataset. strengths: 1. the data is simulated and upon closer examination, seems to have very few perhaps even none missing values. 2. the project idea holds great value for businesses who want to find ways to reduce the number of employees that leave the company. 3. the data should be relatively easier to work with since it was created with the sole purpose of research. this means that the features will be likely be meaningful. areas of improvement: 1. the fact that the data is simulated means that the data may not fully represent factors related to attrition in real life. 2. the data could potentially be used incorrectly. for example, if employers can determine the causes of attrition, they might be less likely to hire someone who displays certain behaviors. 3. the objective is not clearly defined. i am not sure if the project is trying to predict a probability of attrition for each employee or if it is trying to to general analysis on which features correlate to attrition.
