 URL : "https://github.com/rafaelpimpa/buefy/issues/382" TITLE : icons size and positioning BODY : overview of the problem buefy version: 0.5.4 vuejs version: 2.5.2 os/browser : safari 11.0 12604.1.38.1.7 same in google chrome description hey, rafael! : when i've started to use buefy, and switched to <b-icon> i've noticed all my icons a little bit changed. they're not inherit font size anymore, and their positioning looks worse. steps to reproduce the simplest example: <div> <b-icon icon= dashboard ></b-icon> <i class= fa fa-dashboard ></i> dashboard </div> expected behavior expected that both icons would inherit font size and fit perfectly. actual behavior <b-icon> moved to bottom and have bigger font size. ps: i've checked _icon.scss - it looks like buefy has fixed font sizes in pixels, but bulma uses relative ones in rem. ! icons https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1286821/31943015-f10eb876-b8cf-11e7-9ac3-71c71c5b50a3.png
