 URL : "https://github.com/Synodic-Software/Soul-Engine/issues/58" TITLE : buffer indexed reads BODY : todos in 'cameramanager.cpp' the gpubuffer object should have the option to intercept any read or write operations. as they are all internally represented as a 1d array, the ability to interface the data with a arbitrary pattern is useful for a good deal of things. for example, all the ray data is stored in a gpubuffer. memory coherency could be increased if all spatially similar indices on a 2d representation lets say n, n+1, n+21, n+ 531, n + 532 were located next to each other in memory. thus, bugger 0 would read a different value depending on a pattern/pre-processing step
