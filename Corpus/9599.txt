 URL : "https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/issues/2206" TITLE : 3d issue tracker BODY : a recurrent request pops up in the issues about the possibility to develop models in 3d and to benefit from the same capabilities than the ones available in 2d: query operators, spatial transformations, etc. . while it is clearly out of reach of gama right now because we use jts as the geometrical and spatial framework of the platform , it might become one of the goals for gama 1.8. this tracker is intended to keep track of the issues declared so far on this aspect. - returning 3d points for any_point_in in 2199 and for points_on in 2054 - adapting the moving3d skill to accept 3d bounds in 2198 - adapting query operators like inside in 1229 - generalising 3d geometries in 765
