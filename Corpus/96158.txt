 URL : "https://github.com/glimmerjs/glimmer-website/issues/70" TITLE : ember cli canary confusion BODY : this is a bit of a super-nitpick, but there's a part on the installing page that makes my brain skip a beat. the page rather clearly explains we need a canary version of ember cli for glimmer, and walks us through the process of installing it, like so: > to install ember cli canary, run the following command... so far, so good. but then we get to the bottom of the page and read this: > ember cli doesn't have the concept of canary versions... it doesn't? then what did i just install? ðŸ˜• i imagine this is one of those cases where the wording is technically correct and accurate to what's actually going on, but it's really confusing from a user perspective.
