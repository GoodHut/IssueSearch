 URL : "https://github.com/ebiggz/MixrElixr/issues/22" TITLE : gamewisp sub emotes BODY : gamewisp has sub emotes. if you subscribe to certain tiers for a user you can use these emotes. had requests to put this into elixr, but i'm not sure exactly how the api works or anything. for example, not sure how it would match up a mixir username to a gamewisp username to determine if they should be able to use the emote. research needed.
