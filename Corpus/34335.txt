 URL : "https://github.com/raysrashmi/ruby-stackoverflow/issues/27" TITLE : cannot override site BODY : no matter what i try; setting _site_ in configurations or passing it in options like @all_questions = rubystackoverflow.questions options = {:site => 'superuser'} i still get _options_ as :site=> stackoverflow , :key=> xzzfdlyqmyfmzq0adlyk6a , :access_token=> 7kq0iz4b3uvltaqcha730g } i am not sure how to troubleshoot but in ruby-stackoverflow/lib/ruby-stackoverflow/client.rb line 56 options :site ||= configuration.site || stackoverflow is called already, so where else i should be looking at?
