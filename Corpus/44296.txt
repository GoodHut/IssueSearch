BODY : hi, thank you for your good work : . when i setup the project and i launch react-native run-android , i get: objects are not valid as a react child found; object with keys {visible} . if you meat to render a collection of children, use an array instead or wrap the object using createfragment object from the react add-ons. check the render method of 'view'. where do you think the issue is? thanks.
