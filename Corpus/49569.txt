 URL : "https://github.com/holidaypirates/nucleus/issues/44" TITLE : typekit and such like BODY : typekit doesn't seem to give you a css import options so what are peoples approaches for handling things like 3rd party embed codes? options i could see were: - overriding the theme and including it in the header --template cli flag - jumping on the back of this pull request https://github.com/holidaypirates/nucleus/pull/15 for the @scripts annotation and moving the embed code into a self executing function and including it in the scripts: config. ie. in nucleus config: scripts : pattern-library/scripts/typekit-embed.js and typekit-embed.js : function d { var config = { kitid: kit_id, scripttimeout: 3000, async: true }, h=d.documentelement,t=settimeout function {h.classname=h.classname.replace /\bwf-loading\b/g, + wf-inactive ;},config.scripttimeout ,tk=d.createelement script ,f=false,s=d.getelementsbytagname script 0 ,a;h.classname+= wf-loading ;tk.src='https://use.typekit.net/'+config.kitid+'.js';tk.async=true;tk.onload=tk.onreadystatechange=function {a=this.readystate;if f||a&&a!= complete &&a!= loaded return;f=true;cleartimeout t ;try{typekit.load config }catch e {}};s.parentnode.insertbefore tk,s } document ; the latter option is certainly preferable but this would be the first time i've had to add a specific file just for including in pattern library, and since the build step doesn't copy any of my files into the --target directory i'm currently just using browsersync to map back to that file on disk in a different directory, which doesn't seem the cleanest. anyone else got some good ideas around an approach to this?
