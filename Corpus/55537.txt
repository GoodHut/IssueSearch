 URL : "https://github.com/pytest-dev/pluggy/issues/50" TITLE : iterate plugin results BODY : currently we have the firstresult option. an interesting addition would be a way to iterate over the plugins. the big difference to the default of returning all results, is that the consumer can stop iterating at any point. this is useful for things where plugins might cause user interaction. one example is a password hook that tries to get a password from a keychain and if that doesn't work the next plugin is tried, which asks the user for the password in a prompt. with firstresult we don't get the fallback and with the current default of returning all results, the user would always be prompted, even if the password from the keychain would work.
