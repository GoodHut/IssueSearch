 URL : "https://github.com/riboseinc/rnp/issues/560" TITLE : --force and --allow-x BODY : description in https://github.com/riboseinc/rnp/pull/552 we discussed the pros and cons regarding --force and --overwrite and came up with an alternative of granular options like --allow-x where x is the action. it seems that we should allow granular options like when x is overwrite , and also an all-encompassing option like force , which is basically allow-all . should we consolidate them into: --allow-x , where x is something like overwrite --force , where it is equal to --allow-'everything' ? cc: @ni4 @dewyatt @flowher
