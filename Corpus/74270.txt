 URL : "https://github.com/simplabs/eslint-config-simplabs/issues/40" TITLE : enable comma-dangle rule BODY : i would like to enable the eslint comma-dangle rule using the always-multiline configuration see http://eslint.org/docs/rules/comma-dangle always-multiline . to prevent this from becoming a huge bike shedding discussion i would like to focus on the pros and cons of trailing commas. feel free to complete the list in the comments. from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/javascript/reference/trailing_commas: > trailing commas sometimes called final commas can be useful when adding new elements, parameters, or properties to javascript code. if you want to add a new property, you can simply add a new line without modifying the previously last line if that line already uses a trailing comma. this makes version-control diffs cleaner and editing code might be less troublesome. > > javascript has allowed trailing commas in array literals since the beginning, and later added them to object literals ecmascript 5 and most recently ecmascript 2017 to function parameters. > > json, however, disallows trailing commas. pro - less work when adding new items to a list or object - easier to read version control diffs con - not supported in old browser irrelevant thanks to babel - not supported in json eslint doesn't work in json, and single quotes don't work there either but we still use them
