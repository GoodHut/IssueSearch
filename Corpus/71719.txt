 URL : "https://github.com/lairworks/nas2d-core/issues/29" TITLE : add window resize events BODY : this is a two part task -- the event handler should respond to window resize events and push those out to listeners so that they can adjust whatever they need to. the second part is that the renderer classes should be able to dynamically respond to these events including switching back and forth between windowed and fullscreen modes see 28 .
