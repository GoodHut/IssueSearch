 URL : "https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/794" TITLE : create new faq topic BODY : hi! now i'm working at commercial project with nuxtjs and i have met a very unhandy issue: site crashes at ios safari. i have spent several days trying to resolve this problem, and finally i have found the thing that broked down the whole site - it was a small phone number in the footer. what a suprise, mobile safari turns all phone numbers it found into a link, like +7 982 536-50-77 renders into <a href= +7 982 536-50-77 >+7 982 536-50-77</a> . i even create an small and useless gist with componet for super lazy coders: https://gist.github.com/queses/8b008a8b6f7b470cb0a8c5e1788d8c63 i believe it would be great, if you will create the faq topic with explanation of this very unoblivious problem. with best regards! maxim kobozev
