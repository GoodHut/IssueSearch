 URL : "https://github.com/infernojs/inferno/issues/1212" TITLE : linkevent onsubmit failing BODY : issue template observed behaviour inferno is handling the linkevent onsubmit incorrectly. while submitting the form, the page gets refreshed instead of handling the event. sometimes is gets through though, but is looks like the page refresh is called sooner than the event callback. this happens with the following code js class component{ order event { //this part is not called fast enough by the linkevent event.stoppropagation ; } public render { return <form onsubmit={linkevent this, this.order }> ..... ; event.preventdefault does not seem to do the trick. the only thing that works, is calling the calback directly: js class component{ order event { //this part is not called fast enough by the linkevent event.stoppropagation ; } public render { return <form onsubmit={this.order}> ..... ; expected current behaviour inferno should call the callback at all time when an onsubmit linkevent is used inferno metadata w7 / chrome perhabs i am missing something?
