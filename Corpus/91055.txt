 URL : "https://github.com/OHDSI/WebAPI/issues/188" TITLE : support source versioning BODY : when introducing an updated version of a cdm into webapi, prior versions for a given source are lost if you want to use the same source_key. we'd like the ability to be able to retain prior versions of sources to generate analyses against, and choose the source to execute against during cohort/analysis generation. proposed solution: because many of the webapi routs depend on a source_key and adding a version_id would be cumbersome. so, our solution is to add columns to the source table: - group_key: a varchar field used to group sources together for example, different versions of the same source would share a group_key - group_priority: similar to the daimon priority, this is used to indicate the 'preferred' source within a group. - version_id: the id of this source - version_desc: a varchar form of the source such as 1.0.0 - active: an int field 0 or 1 used to indicate that the source is not avilable, used to hide it from clients without deleting the record from the db. these sources will still be referenced by a unique source_key value in the source table. this is to keep better comparability with existing webapi routes.
