 URL : "https://github.com/lshep/sendplot/issues/1" TITLE : several small bugs BODY : hi lori, great to find the package on github now. i really like the functionality of sendplot, because it allows to just add a few tooltips to any type of graph. here are a few small bugs i found: - the maintainer address is outdated. - sep.chr in makeimap does not work as documented: single values are not replicated, contrary to what is indicated in the help file; furthermore, providing a vector like c : , : , : does not work: one actually has to provide a list of separation characters e.g. list : , : , : . - in makeimap , xy.type choice poly is in documentation, but polygon is used in code. - makeimap does not work if the iflag is na best, ulrike
