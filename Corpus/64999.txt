 URL : "https://github.com/yogstation13/yogstation/issues/1962" TITLE : ideas on nerfing borers BODY : earlier today i learned there's still a lot of more work to do. in this issue i want to gather ideas, thoughts, and opinions on nerfing them. this includes - nerfing their random event. cap the maximum amount of borers spawned at 3. - readd dominance. - dominance will increase every tick. - resisting against a borer now operates on their dominance - establish dominance_curve at 50 - if a borers dominance is below the dominance curve is weak. within 1-2 seconds, a host will be able to snap back into control of their body over a borer. possibly also reprimanding the borer from trying again. - anything above the dominance curve is considered strong, however still accessible to resistance. this status is not made to buff the borer from what it is now in anyway. if a borer's dominance is above the curve then it will take the normal 5-7 seconds to remove the borers control over the host. this does not include any backlash on the borer, however. - admin investigate logging to help track brain switches between host and borer. - head injuries / being knocked out / braindamage releasing the grip a borer has on the host.
