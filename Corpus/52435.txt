 URL : "https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/issues/93" TITLE : coap trigger ack token BODY : when a confirmable con message gets acknowleded, the token has been commented out: 269	res := &coap.message{ 270 type: coap.acknowledgement, 271 code: 0, 272 messageid: msg.messageid, 273 //token: msg.token, 274 //payload: payload, 275	} while the payload has been properly commented out as it doesn't send any payload, the token is needed. most client implementations do not check it after validating the acks message id, but some do as the spec asks for and they will find out that the tokens do not match.
