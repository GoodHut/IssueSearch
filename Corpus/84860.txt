 URL : "https://github.com/webpackmonitor/webpackmonitor/issues/91" TITLE : doesn't work with --watch BODY : ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8790386/33349633-a3edafda-d4a3-11e7-9459-56829fda9a34.png this happens as soon as i change a file and the rebuild finishes. by the way it looks like, a new instance of express is launched at that moment. was webpack monitor designed to be used with --watch ? if it wasn't, consider this as a feature request.
