 URL : "https://github.com/OSDLabs/Encore/issues/23" TITLE : change webpage title BODY : the html title of the page is currently music / song name - artist name . this seems okay at the outset, but it could be improved. browsers remember the title of every page in the browser history, and use this title for searching / displaying dynamic suggestions when typing urls. whenever i want to visit encore, i would instinctively type encore into my browser - which would be of no hep at all. i must either remember the ip, or type in music, or search my history for some song i've played using encore before. we should just insert the word encore to all our pages, somehow. maybe _encore - music streaming over bitsnet_ or _encore - by osdlabs_ on the landing page, and then _encore: song name_ on other pages.
