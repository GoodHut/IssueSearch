 URL : "https://github.com/Edgaru089/edgaru089.github.io/issues/1" TITLE : change the cname to sld. BODY : @edgaru089 if you registered a .ml domain same applies to .tk and 3 other free domains , you should make the second level domain directly accessible by anyone. in terms of examples, edgaru089.ml should be accessible. freenom would suspend your domain if you fail to make that page accessible. freenom would suspend your domain if you fail to make that page accessible. freenom would suspend your domain if you fail to make that page accessible. this would happen within a few weeks upon the acquisition of the domain. so please redirect the canonical name of cname from www.edgaru089.ml to edgaru089.ml . trust me. i had wasted a bunch of domains to get to know this feature.
