 URL : "https://github.com/cubex2/customstuff4/issues/2" TITLE : block placement oddity BODY : when using custom blocks with cs4 1.10.2-0.0.2 there is a rather interesting bug. i can freely place the defined blocks as long as i don't try place the block onto a block created by cs4. to replicate, try to create a pillar of any cs4 defined block. you'll get the first block but nothing higher. thanks.
