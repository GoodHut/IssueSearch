 URL : "https://github.com/spatie/vue-tabs-component/issues/17" TITLE : include /dist directory BODY : we use the old stack rails 3 and the only way for us to use these great components is by having .js file to be able to include it in a script tag. i can run npm run build manually, however, sometimes is not as straightforward as it should be, npm is npm. i've just spent 1 hour trying to figure out why builds are failing and it turned out that one of the libs became broken: https://github.com/beautify-web/js-beautify/issues/1247 it could be a time saver for me if i could have dist folder already in the repo. thanks for your great work! a postcard is coming! :
