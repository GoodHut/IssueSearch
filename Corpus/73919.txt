BODY : hi there, been looking for a way to disable the local lfs cache. apologies if this is a duplicate issue. basically our art team has been using perforce for some time, and we are hoping we can get git to emulate perforce's behavior. i am looking to disable local caching of any and all lfs objects in .git/lfs/objects. this would force read-through to the remote lfs store for all checkouts, pulls, clones, stashes, and so on. our repos are very big anywhere up to 250 gb so having the lfs cache of even one revision effectively doubles the footprint on disk, which is not practical for our environment. is there a config setting i maybe missed that allows git lfs to behave this way? thanks!
