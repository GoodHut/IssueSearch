 URL : "https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd/issues/79" TITLE : add a real browser test BODY : i am not sure if we need this - but i thought i would raise it anyway generally i am quite against browser tests. however, i think it could be worthwhile having one smoke test that runs in a real browser. i am fairly keen to use puppeteer https://github.com/googlechrome/puppeteer for this one. it would not need to run in all browsers. this is purely just a small smoke test. criteria - would need to be able to run on travis i think if we run chrome in headless mode this should be fine - needs to be crazy simple with minimal config - i do not want to spend heaps of time maintaining this.
