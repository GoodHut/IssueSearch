 URL : "https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss/issues/180" TITLE : figure name by ss_plots BODY : the current naming convention of some figures prevents their use in latex due to spaces or periods. while this is not a top priority, altering all plots created by ss_plots to use a naming convention that eliminates spaces and periods would be useful for those creating documents of presentations using latex or other program languages.
