 URL : "https://github.com/Sciss/JCollider/issues/2" TITLE : not an issue, a thank you BODY : i just wanted to say that i recently checked out this code and within half an hour i was listening to demo synths playing to my ears' delight. i realize this is not an actively developed project, but i've sort of adopted it for a learning experiment as i know java much better than scala. many thanks for the excellent software. very impressed! :
