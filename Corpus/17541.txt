 URL : "https://github.com/Just-Some-Bots/MusicBot/issues/1444" TITLE : problems with bot BODY : when i load up the bot, it comes in, then disconnects and tries to autosummon back to the channel. and when i request music !play youtube link , it disconnect and reconnect to play nothing. when i request music again, it tells me that i'm in queue for some reason. i've tried updating the bot with update_deps.bat , i've tried deleting and making a new file for the bot, but none of them work.
