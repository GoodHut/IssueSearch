 URL : "https://github.com/tlovett1/custom-contact-forms/issues/326" TITLE : bulk delete of submissions BODY : i might have missed it, but it appears that there is no way to delete a whole slew of spam submissions. when i look at the submissions i find over 200, i can download them and handle offline, but i could not find a way to now tell ccf: delete all submissions. i can delete them one by one - - - - but i don't really want to :- merlin
