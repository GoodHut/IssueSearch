 URL : "https://github.com/AuroraWright/Luma3DS/issues/801" TITLE : launch a title on boot BODY : it would be great to be able to boot directly to a certain title such as a ntr flashcard or the homebrew launcher. this, in addition to some other new features, would allow the development of custom home menus which did things like avoid the banwave by setting the current title to something present in a vanilla 3ds. activity log would still be useful since there can be a non-official one in such launcher show installed titles ctr , ntr , twl or agb .cia , homebrew .3dsx and shortcuts to nds roms installed on flashcards .nds in the same menu allow custom icon/name/top screen per item better folder management of course, aside from the pain produced by developing such a complicated menu, it would involve many luma improvements such as this suggestion giving that menu a way to boot a title spoofing it with another in the friends list being able to boot said menu after a mcu reboot the idea i had about how to set the title you want to use for this was from the rosalina menu, in a similar way to how we can currently switch the current homebrew app. i would not count it as a suggestion for rosalina, though. hence why i didn't post it inside 752.
