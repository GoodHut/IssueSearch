 URL : "https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxPHP/issues/121" TITLE : publish testing helpers BODY : the library ships with some testing helpers. e.g. the test scheduler, but also a base test case and some helpers that are useful. we could move those to the lib/ or src/ for 2.x directory and make them useable by downstream users without having to rely on autoloader hacks. more concretely: - https://github.com/reactivex/rxphp/blob/7aeb8cef74b29bdaa09ea969daf78577299a2aad/test/helper-functions.php - https://github.com/reactivex/rxphp/blob/7aeb8cef74b29bdaa09ea969daf78577299a2aad/test/rx/functional/functionaltestcase.php
