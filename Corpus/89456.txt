 URL : "https://github.com/geany/geany/issues/1681" TITLE : python comment as in pep8 BODY : i think, when commenting python code via edit > format > comment line s , after the character would be better to add a space, as mentioned in pep8 https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ block-comments , resulting: <code> commented line </code> instead of: <code> commented line </code> this prevent me to manual adjust all the commented line s .
