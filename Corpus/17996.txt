 URL : "https://github.com/tsolucio/corebos/issues/198" TITLE : send faq by email BODY : i was wondering if there was a way to send an faq probably through a template to a client. to give an example of a situation: we have a bug in a program, we make an faq out of the ticket. another customer calls in with the same issue. the desk support person sends them the faq with the workaround.
