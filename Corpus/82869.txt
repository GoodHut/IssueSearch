 URL : "https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/4108" TITLE : automatically get a theme BODY : we have 185 themes in the themes repo now ! and git clone --recursive , while being a convenient way of testing different themes , is a big task, even timing out for many people. this issue may be the start to a more complete hugo get command that i have been talking about, which could get some ways of handling external resources such as themes and other components shortcodes etc. . but the scope of this is smaller, it is about themes only. the simple goal is to make this even quicker: https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/ step 3 should be reduced from: bash cd quickstart;\ git init;\ git submodule add https://github.com/budparr/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke;\ edit your config.toml configuration file and add the ananke theme. echo 'theme = ananke ' >> config.toml to: bash cd quickstart;\ git init;\ git submodule add https://github.com/budparr/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke;\ edit your config.toml configuration file and add the ananke theme. echo 'theme = ananke ' >> config.toml if you want to test another theme, just edit your config.toml . there are lots unsaid in the above, but that is just information hiding so i don't see all the problems that may convince me not to do this. some notes to the above: hugo get https://github.com/budparr/gohugo-theme-ananke.git hugo get -u https://github.com/budparr/gohugo-theme-ananke.git hugo get gohugo-theme-ananke hugo get --prune /cc @digitalcraftsman
