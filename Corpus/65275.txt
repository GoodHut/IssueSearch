 URL : "https://github.com/RobinBuschmann/sequelize-typescript/issues/150" TITLE : include in countoptions BODY : i see that for some methods there is a reference to the sequelize model, but sequelize-typescript model<t> is not compatible with model<any, any> . as i understand the change should be made similar to the ifindoptions only for the icountoptions . js return product.count { where: { deletedts: null, }, include: { model: buyer, as: 'buyers' } } bash argument of type '{ where: { deletedts: null ; }; include: { model: typeof buyer; as: string; where: whereoption...' is not assignable to parameter of type 'countoptions | undefined'. type '{ where: { deletedts: null ; }; include: { model: typeof buyer; as: string; where: whereoption...' is not assignable to type 'countoptions'. types of property 'include' are incompatible. type '{ model: typeof buyer; as: string; where: whereoptions<buyer>; attributes: never ; } ' is not assignable to type ' model<any, any> | includeoptions | undefined'. type '{ model: typeof buyer; as: string; where: whereoptions<buyer>; attributes: never ; } ' is not assignable to type ' model<any, any> | includeoptions '. type '{ model: typeof buyer; as: string; where: whereoptions<buyer>; attributes: never ; }' is not assignable to type 'model<any, any> | includeoptions'. type '{ model: typeof buyer; as: string; where: whereoptions<buyer>; attributes: never ; }' is not assignable to type 'includeoptions'. types of property 'model' are incompatible. type 'typeof buyer' is not assignable to type 'model<any, any> | undefined'. type 'typeof buyer' is not assignable to type 'model<any, any>'. property 'instance' is missing in type 'typeof buyer'.
