 URL : "https://github.com/ClusterM/hakchi2/issues/922" TITLE : md5 checksum error BODY : i have the same kernel dump error as many on my us snes. i was using 2.21d and would get the following message when flashing the custom kernel: kernel dumped but the md5 checksum is unknown: 5be67f86fb0b0aaa275cd730d8b40a91 i upgraded to 2.21e and when flashing the custom kernel i got the following: kernel dumped but the md5 checksum is unknown: ea5d1d9061bcc7d0c42374eca76eb611 i continued, and it appeared to complete the kernel dump. it then told me i could upload my roms to the snes classic. i clicked the upload button and immediately received the following error message: shell command tar -xvc / returned exit code 1: tar: can't open '._bin': read-only file system update: a friend who had no issues hacking his snes brought over his computer and hakchi2 program and had the same results with my snes. since then i have uninstalled, factory reset, and flashed the original kernel a few times but still get the same error when flashing the custom kernel. at a loss as to what to do next. please advise.
