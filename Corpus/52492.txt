 URL : "https://github.com/qnighy/tapir/issues/9" TITLE : command line arguments BODY : the original rgsses accept several command line arguments. they allegedly have the following format: - xp: game.exe debug/btest - vx: game.exe test/btest - vx ace: game.exe test/btest console my plan is to keep compatibility with these arguments, while adding several convenience options as hyphend arguments like --dir some_dir .
