 URL : "https://github.com/JGCRI/hector/issues/161" TITLE : methane radiative forcing BODY : radiative forcing of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide: a significant revision of the methane radiative forcing >new calculations of the radiative forcing rf are presented for the three main well-mixed greenhouse gases, methane, nitrous oxide, and carbon dioxide. methane's rf is particularly impacted because of the inclusion of the shortwave forcing; the 1750–2011 rf is about 25% higher increasing from 0.48 w m−2 to 0.61 w m−2 compared to the value in the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2013 assessment; the 100 year global warming potential is 14% higher than the ipcc value. we present new simplified expressions to calculate rf. unlike previous expressions used by ipcc, the new ones include the overlap between co2 and n2o; for n2o forcing, the co2 overlap can be as important as the ch4 overlap. the 1750–2011 co2 rf is within 1% of ipcc's value but is about 10% higher when co2 amounts reach 2000 ppm, a value projected to be possible under the extended rcp8.5 scenario. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016gl071930/full
