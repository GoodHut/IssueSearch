 URL : "https://github.com/jeremyoverman/action-runner/issues/3" TITLE : create helper class BODY : right now all help messages are scattered throughout the various classes, and we have some repetition of code between them. we need to create a central helper class that can consolidate this help logic that current and future classes can make use of. considerations: - tabular lists should be easily formattable - directory listings should be easily callable - these methods should be easily usable by an action creator
