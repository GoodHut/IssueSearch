 URL : "https://github.com/PEXPlugins/PermissionsEx/issues/2665" TITLE : default rank not working BODY : using latest 1.10.2 sponge api 5 i've set my default rank as default using the option, but when new players join, they don't have any permission or rank. also i'm using enjin to auto add ranks but the ranks aren't been automaticly given to players, i'm having to do everything by hand. any help would be greatly appreciated. thanks - alice
