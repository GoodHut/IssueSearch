 URL : "https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/2017" TITLE : update gui docs BODY : while i will be merging 2006, i noticed that there are a few outstanding added suffixes to document, and that the documentation doesn't implement the preferred .. attribute:: syntax following the suffix table. before formal release it would be good to at least walk the structures to make sure all of the suffixes are documented, but it would be really nice to add the additional suffix documentation since the directive is what allows :attr: linking to work.
