 URL : "https://github.com/PsychoinformaticsLab/neuroscout/issues/66" TITLE : implement analysis viewer BODY : this will be a page to view everything about the analysis and its results without being able to edit anything. locked analyses can only be opened in analysis viewer. unlocked analyses can be opened in either the viewer or builder . the viewer could also be embedded in the review tab of the builder. @tyarkoni @adelavega am i thinking about this correctly? the viewer will need to be spec'ed out before implementing.
