 URL : "https://github.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan/issues/270" TITLE : options for window size BODY : it's nice that the demos support interactive window resizing. would be possible also to support specifying the initial window sizes from command line instead of them being hard-coded separately in each of the demos? ps. another alternative than command line option for specifying the window size, fullscreen and perf options that i listed in earlier feature requests , would be configuration file, but i think then demos should take config file name as optional argument.
