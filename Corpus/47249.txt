BODY : hey @benjycui, i'm using this module in some libraries and applications and it's been helpful. i'd like to contribute back and help with the maintenance of the project. are you accepting contributions at this time? where is the best place to begin? it looks like there's a need for complete test coverage, eslint cleanup, and documentation. if you're interested, we could begin opening issues to track this work.
