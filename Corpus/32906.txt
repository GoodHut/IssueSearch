 URL : "https://github.com/teamon/tesla/issues/129" TITLE : 🎁 1.0.0 wishlist BODY : i'd like to start a wishlist for 1.0.0 release. it should include any last breaking changes before moving into proper semver for future releases. please comment if you'd like tesla to have or drop something in the near future. here are mine: - new: cache middleware - i think we should have a decent http cache middleware like faraday-http-cache https://github.com/plataformatec/faraday-http-cache with pluggable backend a simple interface of get/put while handling all of the http cache stuff - breaking: drop aliases - it is not widely used nor documented feature, aliases were never kept up to date and with current implementation they add a compile-time link from tesla builder to all adapters and middlewares. and there is no way to make them work for any custom middleware.
