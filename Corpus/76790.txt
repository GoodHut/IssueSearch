 URL : "https://github.com/VenKamikaze/mediagoblin-html5-multi-upload/issues/3" TITLE : make default upload form BODY : i think it would be practical to have an option to use multi-upload as the default submit page or even to just make it so whenever the plugin is active . without that, users need to follow a dedicated link their admin sends them rather than follow the user interface.
