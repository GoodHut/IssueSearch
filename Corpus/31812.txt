 URL : "https://github.com/marc1706/fast-image-size/issues/45" TITLE : support webp images BODY : the webp seems to become a good alternative to jpeg or png, so even though not all browsers support it yet there are some sites out there that can already send them to the browser mostly by looking at the accept-header . i assume that the support is going to grow more and more so maybe you can add support for it?
