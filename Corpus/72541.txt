BODY : hi! sorry for reaching out through here. i know it's always awkward, but given that i'll be moving by end of month and will then be able to set up my own cabinet, i was wondering if you'd still be open and/or available to perhaps help me with the artwork, as you had kindly offered? i am perfectly comfortable with no being the answer - i know things change and your availability as well, between work and family - so feel free to decline : if, on the other hand, you'd still be available, would you be fine with me sending you an email to follow up? if so, no need to give it publicly here. i'll drop you a line later! thanks in advance, and hope you're having a good week! - paulo tavares / pjft
