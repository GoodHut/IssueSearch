 URL : "https://github.com/hawaiianchimp/sitemapper/issues/19" TITLE : check if sitemap is valid? BODY : hi, thanks for the great library and i think its the only nodejs sitemap parser which is upto date. i was wondering is there any way to check whether the sitemap is having valid syntax? i basically needs a validator for sitemap but i am sure that this parser will be already using rules for the schema of sitemap. so does it throws any errors on detecting invalid syntax or is it forgiving? i am happy to help and submit a pr if that can be implemented using the code already in place. kind regards
