 URL : "https://github.com/DJI-Mobile-SDK-Tutorials/Android-UILibraryDemo/issues/1" TITLE : ui library crashing BODY : hello, i've been attempting to follow this demo, but i've been having the application crash no matter what i do. i've added logs and sleeps to the on create method to try and verify where it crashes, and the crash is given before the logs/sleeps even come into play. based on this, and the error logs which display only on the android hardware/library code when i plug it into a phone, i think there may be some kind of incompatible code with new android software for android studio. - steps to reproduce the bug: download the code from github and run it as described in the tutorial. - android studio: 3.0 - dji android sdk version you are using : sdk given from tutorial/most recent downloads - dji product you are using: mavic pro not connected to studio at the moment - android system version you are using: android 6.0.1 - android device you are using : galaxy j2 prime hopefully this helps, and i look forward to hearing on this issue soon.
