 URL : "https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/issues/97" TITLE : additional logging request BODY : hi! for those of us that are not using a reverse proxy, is there a way to get more logging? i'm looking specifically for user login attempts. also, it appears that the log files only go back one version .1 -- can we increase this number or have it customizable per installation? sorry this may have been to enhancement requests and not one.
