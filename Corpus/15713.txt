 URL : "https://github.com/kennethjiang/OctoPrint-Slicer/issues/65" TITLE : finer fan control BODY : my printer allows for fine fan speed control, but sadly the slicer plugin does not support that. i would like to see a slider that allows me to set the speed between 0 and 255. i run my fan at 25% most of the time, because any faster and it cools my bed down and i get terrible warping and lifting. currently i need to manually download the model, edit it in notepad++ delete it from the server and reupload, which is really inconvinient.
