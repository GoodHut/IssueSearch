 URL : "https://github.com/Nikey646/VndbSharp/issues/27" TITLE : add a tag/trait converter BODY : i'm not sure if this is quite in the scope of this project, but it would be nice to have a converter for tags and traits where you could give it a tag or trait id, and it would return with the members of the tag or trait.
