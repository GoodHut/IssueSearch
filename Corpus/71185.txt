 URL : "https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler/issues/51" TITLE : accuracy of heap profile BODY : i've got a profile where 90%+ of allocations are object array allocations in one method which does not do any allocations in bytecode. what kind of inaccuracies are expected when doing heap profiling? could it be allocated in inlined methods which are not shown?
