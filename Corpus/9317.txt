 URL : "https://github.com/dji-sdk/Manifold-Cam/issues/15" TITLE : usb write error BODY : we have our m-100 set up with the manifold and guidance with newest firmwares. and we set-up a simple script to launch the manifold-cam test file to feed the dji go app with the z3 camera feed when the drone is on and manifold gets turned on, but after a varying length of time from seconds to a minute or two there is a problem. the camera feed on the dji go app goes gray/inactive and won't update anymore, even though when checked on the manifold itself with the -d it is still working fine and live, but just won't transfer the feed further. and pretty much the only thing we can get out of the logs is: usb write err -1, 11366 rrret -1 usb write err -1, 11367 rrret -1 usb write err -1, 11368 rrret -1 usb write err -1, 11369 rrret -1 usb write err -1, 11370 rrret -1 usb write err -1, 11371 rrret -1 the problem shouldn't be about user rights as the manifold_cam/test is being run as root some help with this would be appreciated.
