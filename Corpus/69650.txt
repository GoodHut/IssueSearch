 URL : "https://github.com/ncss-tech/soilReports/issues/34" TITLE : to check polygon output BODY : add an additional .shp file to output that includes information regarding polygons with above-threshold proportion of sample values outside 5-95% range for the mu. currently, statistics shapefile output contains median values for each raster and the tocheck flag which is a ranking based on the amount of samples outside range. this polygon is useful for symbolizing where problematic polygons occur, and also the distribution of abiotic factors vis-Ã -vis the median across a mu extent... but does not tell why a particular polygon is flagged. this can rarely be determined from the median values unless it is a very extreme case. the new shapefile will follow same format as the stats shapefile 1 column per raster only instead of medians, contains the proportion of samples outside range for each raster data source. this will reduce the iterative process of looking up polygon ids to see why they were flagged. currently that information is available in the tabular output at the end of the report html file. in addition to reducing iteration between the report and the shapefile display in e.g. arcmap this will allow symbolizing of mus based on proportion outside range for individual data sources rather than an aggregate of all data sources.
