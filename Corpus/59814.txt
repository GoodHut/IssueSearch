 URL : "https://github.com/ANSSI-FR/polichombr/issues/147" TITLE : use relative addresses BODY : hi, disclaimer : we did not actually test it so that's an hypothetic issue didn't want to pollute the production platform . as addresses are virtual addresses and not relatives ones, an ida program rebase may probably trigger an undefined behavior dupplicated names, addresses not found, etc. . actions performed while debugging aslr might also cause issues. anyway, using relative virtual addresses might be a good solution just sub the oep address ? . cheers, : okay, debugging with ida is not cool and noone should ever do it, but still.
