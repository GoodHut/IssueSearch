 URL : "https://github.com/FlyingPikachu/Quests/issues/78" TITLE : need help with quests BODY : so its not exactly an issue but i would like more info on the quests requirements sections than the wiki offers. in game the editor displays more options than what the wiki shows and i want to be able to make the quests in config files so its easier as all i would do is copy paste and change names. so if you could email me with more info about setting up the quests besides what the wiki says i would greatly appreciate that. thanks.
