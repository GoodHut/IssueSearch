 URL : "https://github.com/phovea/phovea_core/issues/88" TITLE : rename get to getbyid BODY : i suggest to rename the get function to getbyid and to rename the non-exported getbyid function to something else: https://github.com/phovea/phovea_core/blob/develop/src/data.ts l194 i'm not quite clear what the difference here is and it's unclear what a persisted object containing the id is, but from a readability perspective, just get is very minimal, especially when considering that's it's not called on an object. more radically, this and other functions could also be called getdataset s by id|name|.. to make it even more explicit. the renaming of the imports isn't a good solution, as we also want to refer to these function names in the documentation.
