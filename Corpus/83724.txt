 URL : "https://github.com/felixfbecker/php-language-server/issues/384" TITLE : class_alias not supported BODY : go to definition and other intellisense features does not work on class aliases or classes created with php's class_alias function. i noticed that class alias isn't supported in any php extension from the marketplace is this an issue with vscode itself, probably something the language server protocol is lacking?
