 URL : "https://github.com/coala/gci-leaders/issues/111" TITLE : use graphql api BODY : we should use github's graphql api instead of the the rest api. this will let us get a lot more data in many fewer requests. you should preferably already have some graphql experience in order to properly make use of everything graphql has to offer, such as pagination and query variables. check out https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-client for making requests.
