 URL : "https://github.com/opnsense/core/issues/1646" TITLE : rest api documentation BODY : the docs for the rest api do not show any end points or how to get them. the only docs are here: https://docs.opnsense.org/development/how-tos/api.html. the example script gives 2 end points /core/firmware/status and /core/firmware/update but nothing further is documented that i can find. is this all that is currently supported, or is the documentation missing?
