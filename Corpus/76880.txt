 URL : "https://github.com/typicode/json-server/issues/469" TITLE : map query params feature BODY : hi, awesome work, tks! i would like to have the option to map the query params. for example in my project we use page and per_page and teaching json-server to use those instead is quite verbose right now. similar as with custom routes having the option to set the maps. e.g: json { _page : page , _limit: per_page }
