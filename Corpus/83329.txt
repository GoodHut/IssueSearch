 URL : "https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/1264" TITLE : can't connect through wss BODY : description i have code like this if fs.existssync './certs' { options.key = fs.readfilesync './certs/privatekey.key' ; options.cert = fs.readfilesync './certs/certificate.crt' ; if fs.existssync './certs/ca_bundle.crt' { options.ca = fs.readfilesync './certs/ca_bundle.crt' ; } } const httpsserver = https.createserver options, req, res => { res.writehead 200 ; res.end 'hello world ' ; } ; var wss = new websocketserver {server: httpsserver, port: 1030} ; and it looks like the server is not listening for wss connections. i can connect using ws protocol, but wss doesn't work. it used to work on version 2.x.x doesn't work on the most recent one. reproducible in: version: 3.3.3 node.js version s : 8.4, 8.9.1, 4.8.6 os version s : freebsd 11.1-release-p4 amd64, windows 10 ! obraz https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2981598/34360754-029f2b32-ea64-11e7-87f4-efd9adaccc80.png
