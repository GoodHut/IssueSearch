 URL : "https://github.com/NCAR/ParallelIO/issues/871" TITLE : make compmap array 0-based BODY : our new decomp files are 0-based, as is our new init_decomp function. but the code still has to deal with 1-based maps. for example this code in pio_rearrange.c: / the compmap array is 1 based but calculations are 0 based / idx_to_dim_list ndims, gsize, compmap k - 1, gcoord ; i will convert the compmap array to be 0-based internally, and then we will have no more 1-based things in the c library. as god, kernighan and ritchie intended.
