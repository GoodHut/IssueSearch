 URL : "https://github.com/johntyler3/EventPromoter/issues/2" TITLE : fix map markers BODY : right now, there is a temporary fix of having markers offset when there are multiple markers on the same location. the fix that i am thinking about is making it when you click on a marker, it brings up a dialog instead of a info box, and that dialog would have a listview of the events for that location.
