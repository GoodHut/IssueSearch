 URL : "https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-eslint/issues/818" TITLE : children rule config files BODY : issue type <!-- can be bug , feature request , question , etc.--> question issue description <!-- describe what happened, what you think should have happened, and any other relevant details --> i have two different .eslintrc.json files one for the root of the project and one with specific rules inside my test directory. eslint seems to be able to figure out which file to use but the ide linter seems to be ignoring the test config json when linting my test files. is this configuration supported or am i setting something incorrectly? bug checklist - restart atom - create a new eslintrc.json file under a child directory with rule overrides - open a file with the child directory and use a rules and use a custom rule from the config file
