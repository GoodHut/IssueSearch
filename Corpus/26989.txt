 URL : "https://github.com/gwu-libraries/sfm-ui/issues/773" TITLE : clarify seed counts BODY : 1. where ever seed counts appear, it should be clarified if active, deleted or total. 2. if only displaying 1 number, i'd suggest that active makes the most sense. 3. on seed list, would be helpful to have breakdown of active/deleted. <img width= 506 alt= 2017-04-06_0740 src= https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/588335/24752608/ac4876f4-1a9c-11e7-8703-92dc6890ddc9.png >
