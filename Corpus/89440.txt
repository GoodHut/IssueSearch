 URL : "https://github.com/rsta2/circle/issues/52" TITLE : pwm audio on the rpi zero BODY : i would like to use the pwmsounddevice with the rpi zero but this requires the standard pins 40,etc to be changed because the zero doesn't have those audio pins available. i did see you had a quick solution to this in the oct 1, 2017 commit, but this does not seem to work anymore . any pointers on how this can be done currently?
