 URL : "https://github.com/sniklaus/youtube-watchmarker/issues/3" TITLE : mark as unwatched BODY : is it possible to mark a video as unwatched? i'm using an extension that disables autoplay because often i just want to read comments or the description without marking the video as watched. would be cool to have a button at _watch?v=_ .
