BODY : the multimedia extension gives the possibility of adding a description to an image ; the description is printed in the non-vorple interpreters, and put in an alt attribute in the html page generated by the vorple interpreter. i have found a few sources on the internet saying that putting text in alt means the image is ignored by screen readers. it also depends on the browser, apparently, since the html spec is unclear. this kinds of defeat the purpose, doesn't it? apparently, using the title attribute is a better solution, as the title of an image will be read by a screen reader as long as alt is empty sources: https://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2016/02/short-note-on-use-of-alt-and-the-title-attribute/ https://www.powermapper.com/tests/screen-readers/labelling/img-title/
