 URL : "https://github.com/Safari-FIDO-U2F/Safari-FIDO-U2F/issues/21" TITLE : nextcloud u2f doesn't work BODY : i'm not sure if this is a bug with safari-fido-u2f or if it's a problem with nextcloud, but i get the following error when attempting to use the u2f mode: u2f.getapiversion is not a function. in 'u2f.getapiversion', 'u2f.getapiversion' is undefined looking in u2f.js , i don't see a getapiversion property anywhere, but the google authenticator reference code does use this, so i believe it's a bug with safari-fido-u2f.
