 URL : "https://github.com/google/aiyprojects-raspbian/issues/210" TITLE : voicehat not working BODY : i bought the magpi with the aiy voice kit months ago and completely forgot about it. i tried to set it up today but i'm having zero luck. i installed the latest image and all i get is failed to find the voicehat soundcard i followed the instructions in hacking.md, but the problem persists. arecord --list-devices returns no soundcards found... any ideas?
