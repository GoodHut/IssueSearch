 URL : "https://github.com/krallin/tini/issues/81" TITLE : using the --init flag BODY : 1. now that docker 1.13 has added a --init flag, is this a good way to use tini now? 2. it looks like it will automatically add tini version 0.13.0 - git.949e6fa as /dev/init for you. does this mean there is no need to download tini anymore? 3. which method do you suggest as the preferred method ?
