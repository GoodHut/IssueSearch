 URL : "https://github.com/yeriomin/YalpStore/issues/111" TITLE : integration into fdroid BODY : it would be awesome if yalpstore could create a local fdroid binary repository. so we would get automatic updates and all features from fdroid. i know fdroid is not intended to download proprietary software but it would be a easy solution, to get rid of google play store or aptoide and other proprietary app store replacements. google play store has a lot of apps so maybe the user should decide which apps he wants in the repository.
