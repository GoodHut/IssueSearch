 URL : "https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/issues/3035" TITLE : incorrect anchor placement BODY : fontforge seems to incorrectly display mark-to-mark anchors possibly other anchors too... i notice this in the metrics window, where there seems to be a general discrepancy of about 10pts between the actual position of the anchor and how it is rendered. for example, the combining overline u+0305 , when set up to repeat over itself using mark-to-mark as is the case in timesnewroman , will be shown with a gap between iterations of the mark that is wider than is actually specified. this becomes obvious if you build a new glyph using copy-and-paste to position the second iteration of the overline where the anchor is and then comparing the pre-composed character with the composed one in the metrics window. fonts that are generated do not reflect this i.e. they work properly according to where anchors are placed , so it seems to be a rendering/display issue within fontforge.
