 URL : "https://github.com/simonsfoundation/inferelator_ng/issues/51" TITLE : running without kvs BODY : what i currently have problems with every time is that i have not installed slurm on my computer yet, and so every time i need to run the inferelator, i need to disable kvs, which requires me to go into the code and change some parameters and i always forget which, or rather, what to change them to . i think there needs to be an option that automatically disables multithreading, for people who don't have slurm and want to run just on one node.
