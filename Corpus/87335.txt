 URL : "https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/issues/2387" TITLE : kudu can't match branches BODY : hey there! kudu seems unable to match branches with just patterns instead of names. gitflow for example uses master for the current production system and release/a.b.c as the changing branch name for qs stuff. i tried to configure a pattern for such release branches, but i got neither an error nor a checkout of the current release branch. repro steps. create a git flow enabled git repository create two azure web apps set the deploy keys for both apps configure the first one to use master configure the second one to use a release branch the settings.xml shows whatever i configure in the form field in the azure portal.
