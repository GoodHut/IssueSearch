 URL : "https://github.com/RNAcentral/rnacentral-webcode/issues/126" TITLE : minor data/display issues BODY : here are some small problems i've noted browsing that should be fixed. - see why species is of http://test.rnacentral.org/search?q=rna%20and%20rna_type:%22guide%20rna%22%20and%20taxonomy:%225686%22 is 5686 - determine why extra and incorrect species/facets are being shown as facets when we already have selected 1 species see: http://test.rnacentral.org/search?q=rna%20and%20taxonomy:%22511145%22%20and%20rna_type:%22rnase%20p%20rna%22 note how clicking most facets produces no results. in this example we have already limited to e. coli so why are other species being shown as selectable. - do not display showing top text if displaying all species. see: http://test.rnacentral.org/search?q=rna%20and%20rna_type:%22guide%20rna%22 plus it would be nice to know how many organisms are actually there.
