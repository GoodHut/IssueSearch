 URL : "https://github.com/phpipam/phpipam/issues/1635" TITLE : how to add a new language BODY : i would like to provide a new translation of phpipam in a language that doesn't exist yet in the available ones. i see that in the path /functions/locale/ there is a folder for each language; inside the folder of a language i see the subfolder /lc_messages where two files are available: phpipam.mo and phpipam.po. since i'm not an expert of these file types, is it possible to have some advices to know how to proceed? i would prefer to work on a text/doc/xls file instead of installing additional software to manipulate these files, is it possible?
