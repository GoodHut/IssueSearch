 URL : "https://github.com/haugene/docker-transmission-openvpn/issues/307" TITLE : configuration dir torrent BODY : hello, i can not enter the mechanism to define torrent downloads downloaded and temporary. i modified the environment-variables.tmpl file so that it looked for the correct directory port of peer. everything is configured in transmission, but when i launch a download i already have in my directory it starts to download it in the one: /var/lib/docker/overlay2/b40d71a9481dc7048b0db1d703aa5f2fc58fa0c670c37bf7538cb07115657b63/merged/mnt/data/torrent despite everything i see well by connecting to the mistletoe that the good repertoire are defined as well as the port of peer that is open. what is the mechanism for defining the directory? for now the only way i have found to fill in with my data and this file: /var/lib/docker/overlay2/eb152b42e5e52ff03360bded2f0de79a1ea68fd7d4746c420e40faf9f846107c/diff/etc/transmission/environment-variables.tmpl i run my docker with this command: docker run --cap-add=net_admin --device=/dev/net/tun -d -v /mnt/data/torrent/:/data -e openvpn_provider=nordvpn -e openvpn_config=fr20.nordvpn.com.tcp443 -e openvpn_username=mail@mail.fr -e openvpn_password=password -p 9091:9091 haugene/transmission-openvpn
