 URL : "https://github.com/szpajder/RTLSDR-Airband/issues/71" TITLE : high cpu usage on freebsd BODY : i'm not sure you're interested in freebsd but if you have any idea or workaround to solve this, i hope you to enhance/add some codes for freebsd. i compiled rtl_airband on freebsd 10.3-release and it's working, demodulating correctly, saving mp3 file, and streaming to my icecast server. but it uses 100% power of a cpu core like this: ----- cpu: 36.3% user, 1.1% nice, 1.8% system, 0.2% interrupt, 60.7% idle this cpu has 4 cores so it's eating 25% of total cpu power pid username thr pri nice size res state c time wcpu command 4977 root 5 20 0 79200k 15380k nanslp 2 42.9h 100.78% rtl_airband ----- state is nanslp = nanosleep so it should spend most of time sleeping, but eating cpu power. compile could be done like below. installed necessary libraries like: pkg install rtl-sdr lame fftw3 fftw3-float libshout libvorbis libconfig git clone https://github.com/szpajder/rtlsdr-airband.git cd rtlsdr-airband/ edited x86 part of makefile like: cflags += -march=native -i/usr/local/include ldlibs += -lfftw3f -lc++ and change all -g root to -g wheel in install part and continued like: platform=x86 gmake gmake install pid file should be located in /var/run so change rtl_airband.conf to use this place, not /run. example of startup script for rc.d: !/bin/sh provide: rtl_airband require: daemon before: login keyword: nojail shutdown . /etc/rc.subr name=rtl_airband rcvar=rtl_airband_enable command= /usr/local/bin/rtl_airband load_rc_config ${name} run_rc_command $1 thanks,
