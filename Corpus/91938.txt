 URL : "https://github.com/jakeharding/repo-health/issues/60" TITLE : usage / url clarification BODY : currently in your readme.md, and on your application there is no clarification on what to do. i would suggest possibly putting a usage statement and/or on the application page have an example of the url you would like the user to enter. initially i assumed it was a full url and didn't realize you anticipated something along the line of cakephp/cakephp instead. i believe the addition of a piece to the readme or on your application having an example would be an enormous benefit.
