 URL : "https://github.com/mbasaglia/Qt-Color-Widgets/issues/29" TITLE : advanced color selector BODY : so as mentioned earlier, i'm developing an advanced color selector widget which could be used as dock in graphical applications, so more compact than color dialog , which would be basically a configurable composite widget containing various existing widgets wheel, 2d slider, perhaps multiple 1d sliders, etc . planned features so far: - x switching between few primary color selector forms triangle & square wheel and 2d+hue sliders for now - harmony color selection kinda done, but no ui to actually make them active for now - configurable sliders - color history - foreground/background color switching since i've started implementing this, i've run into some issues for which i'm going to open separate threads so that we can keep this one just for feature and maybe implementation discussion . here's my development branch: https://github.com/caryoscelus/qt-color-widgets/tree/advanced_color_selector
