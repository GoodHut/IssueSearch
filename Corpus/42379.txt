 URL : "https://github.com/npryce/hamkrest/issues/33" TITLE : available via gradle? BODY : hi, i'm trying to install by adding to my app's build.gradle: testcompile 'com.natpryce.hamkrest:1.4.2.0' but wasn't in your readme, and it fails to resolve, and i found that this plugin is missing on plugins.gradle.org. i haven't authored a plugin myself but i believe this just requires publishing to plugins.gradle.org. that would make this library infinitely more useful. thanks!
