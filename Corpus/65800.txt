 URL : "https://github.com/davidalger/capistrano-magento2/issues/59" TITLE : lib directory additions BODY : hi, i'm not sure if this is directly an issue for deployment, however it poses a problem. currently using the recommended .gitignore from here: https://github.com/magento/magento2-community-edition/blob/master/.gitignore the 'lib/' directory is excluded. some extensions however are placing directories in here, for example magestore and magebirdpopup. currently i'm forcing a git add on these directories to add them in. is this the best approach or should it be catered for in deployment? kind regards, kieron
