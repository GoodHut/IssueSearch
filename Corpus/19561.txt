 URL : "https://github.com/kris-nova/kubicorn/issues/227" TITLE : add issue template BODY : can we please add an issue template to the repository? i want it to be as short as possible! the only things i can think of to add at this point would be the following use issues for anything. they can be for features, questions, ideas, or just to say hi. we will close issues we think no longer require work, and we might change issue titles or descriptions to help other users find what they need. we love you, and think your issue title is great, but we sometimes know what the underlying bug is, and can relabel it accordingly. if you submit a bug, include any information you think is relevant to recreate, or analyze. but most importantly... share your version git commit sha in your issue!
