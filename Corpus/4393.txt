 URL : "https://github.com/gap-packages/xmodalg/issues/2" TITLE : clean up tests BODY : you may see test logs e.g. at https://travis-ci.org/gap-system/gap-docker-pkg-tests-stable/jobs/281452101 currently the test passes with default set of packages loaded, but fails otherwise. it will be useful to investigate that, check if there any errors e.g. when gap is started with no packages, some calculations return fail instead of a meaningful result??? , and make tests more reproducible.
