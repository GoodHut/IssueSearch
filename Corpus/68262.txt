 URL : "https://github.com/Cryptodog/cryptodog/issues/37" TITLE : request for repackaging BODY : firefox will be leaving all it's xul add-ons behind. since you've already developed this for chrome and firefox is, or soon will be, a chrome clone, you shouldn't need to modify this much to work on future versions of firefox. however, i was wondering if you had the old xul code lying around. i use a browser called pale moon and it uses xul add-ons. most of firefox's xul add-ons work flawlessly in pale moon. i was wondering if you might put out an xpi file for download and installation in pale moon? i am unable to use the recently developed cryptocat app as i am behind a firewall that prevents the app from connecting to the internet and i can no longer locate the old cryptocat add-on package.
