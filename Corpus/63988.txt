 URL : "https://github.com/ybrs/single-beat/issues/15" TITLE : feature: remote control BODY : just an issue to track myself. when single-beat runs with more than a few servers, the biggest issues are how can i restart this , where are the logs now , is it really working , did it spawn etc. so next version will have some kind of cli with tail command - and stop/restart/pause commands.
