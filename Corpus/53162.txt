 URL : "https://github.com/react-native-material-design/react-native-material-design.github.io/issues/12" TITLE : demo app does not work BODY : the demo app doesn't currently work because components used in it require a version of react-native higher than the one specified in the demo app's package.json . it looks like there are 5-6 prs open on that repo which could potentially resolve the issues with building and trying to use the current demo app.
