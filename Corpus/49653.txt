 URL : "https://github.com/tukkek/javelin/issues/92" TITLE : undeads and construcs BODY : these do not regenerate hp while resting, and should only be healed by inflict wounds / mend type spells. this way, they really shouldn't be commonly offered for hire as their cr doesn't reflect their usefulness remove them as dwelling options, mercenary guilds, etc - a boolean monster recruit would be helpful here . see hos this is being handled on squadscreen and adapt to new system.
