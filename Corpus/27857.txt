 URL : "https://github.com/infinispan-demos/infinispan-openshift-multitenancy/issues/1" TITLE : enhance readme file BODY : the readme does not contain information on what multi-tenancy refers to here. an external user might not know what this demo is about. also, it'd be interesting to highlight what the user has to do to see multi-tenancy in action. the instructions are currently vague and do not demonstrate how multi-tenancy can be exercised. all it says that you play with an application, which is the same that you can do with a hello world demo ;
