 URL : "https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/850" TITLE : wds nothing changed. BODY : const path = require 'path' ; module.exports = { devserver: { contentbase: path.join __dirname, dist }, entry: './src/app.js', output: { path: path.join __dirname, 'dist' , filename: 'bundle.js' } }; app.js is empty. when i now add random garbage to app.js be it correct syntax or not , dev-server correctly spots the change and starts compiling, but apparantly not the file i just saved. webpack: compiling... hash: 5a194bf652a9d1f48771 version: webpack 2.2.1 time: 33ms chunk {0} bundle.js main 300 kb entry 36 ./src/app.js 60 bytes {0} built + 85 hidden modules webpack: compiled successfully. and chrome dev console says: wds nothing changed. and manually geting /bundle.js shows its still serving the old file.
