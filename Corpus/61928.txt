 URL : "https://github.com/splitio/ruby-client/issues/164" TITLE : cache adapter questions BODY : this is just a lazy support question and i would be fine sending an email or discussing elsewhere. how much can one use the default memoryadapters::mapadapter with a typical rails application that takes a descent amount of web traffic? what is stored in memory? splits & envs only? per user treatments? will the memory grow unbound or does it get collected?
