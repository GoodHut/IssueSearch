 URL : "https://github.com/jschaf/esup/issues/44" TITLE : symlinked init file BODY : my emacs dir is c:\users\simon\.emacs.d inside is my .init.el file, however, it is symlinked to the actual file which is stored in my dropbox directory: d:\dropbox\emacs\.init.el when i run esup i expect it to use my .emacs.d directory, and not my dropbox directory. however, when esup starts it is downloading all of the packages again to my dropbox dir, and i think its due to the symlink the location of my user init file is correct simon\.emacs.d . is there any way to get esup to use the .emacs.d directory without following the symlink and downloading everything again to the dropbox dir? my config is here https://github.com/sho-87/dotfiles/blob/master/emacs/init.el if it helps
