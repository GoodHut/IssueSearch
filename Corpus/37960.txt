 URL : "https://github.com/ngageoint/scale/issues/984" TITLE : new v6 job rest apis BODY : deprecate the v5 job detail rest api and add a new v6 version with the following changes: 1. remove the cpus_required , mem_required , and disk_out_required fields; also rename disk_in_required to input_file_size and results to output . these changes should be made to both the job model and serializer. 2. remove the inputs and outputs sections. 3. remove the job_exes section. if the job status is running, completed, or failed, add an execution section that contains the job execution details like from 983 where job.num_exes == job_exe.exe_num. 4. remove the recipes section. add a recipe section that contains the non-superseded recipe if exists that matches the job. use the recipebaseserializer. make the same change as 1. above to the /jobs/ api. make sure the patch job api is also deprecated and updated to return the new detail response. make sure all of the v5 job apis remain unchanged.
