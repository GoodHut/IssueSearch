 URL : "https://github.com/jsreport/jsreport/issues/296" TITLE : jsreport config shortcuts BODY : some configuration options spawns multiple properties/extensions which makes it complex to set up correctly. for example, it is common to allow to jsreport to access local files, however now user needs to edit the phantom-pdf config, assets config, scripts config, tasks config and possibly other places. it could be done with just single root config allowlocalaccess: true . i would even like that this is the default in the release 2. the next example which requires to be set on multiple places is the strategy we use for the rendering. if you want to run in http server, you need to change tasks, phantom and electron configs. it could be done with just single root config executionstrategy: http-server the last example is if the jsreport should run in stateless mode. this requires to change the connectionstring, logs and fs store. it could be done with just single root config stateless: true i don't want to make it even more complicated with new options. i see significant need only for the first one. maybe we have still time for making this. just want to share my thoughts for now.
