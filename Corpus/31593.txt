 URL : "https://github.com/SpaceK33z/plex2netflix/issues/30" TITLE : ssl error in script BODY : i get a certificate error for each query request when i run the script now. looks like the ssl for https://webduck.nl/plex2netflix/search expired in late september. i changed it to http but it looks like there's a redirect to force https which just kicks in instead. as best as i can tell the got command used can't ignore invalid ssl or i'd flip that on for testing, looking like the only fix is to renew the ssl?
