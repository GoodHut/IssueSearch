 URL : "https://github.com/NSLS-II/databroker/issues/264" TITLE : override handler registry BODY : in the new api functions to get data there appears to be no way to override the default handlers. it is great to get data via the dataset = db '5933c2' data_gen = dataset.data 'fccd_image' data = list data_gen but there is no way to override the handler to look at the data differently. get_events has a method to override the handler.
