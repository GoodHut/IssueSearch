 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/VSProjectSystem/issues/173" TITLE : turn on cps for vs2017 BODY : hello! the guide here https://github.com/microsoft/vsprojectsystem/blob/master/doc/scenario/turn_on_cps_for_csharp_vb_project.md says we need to switch project type guid to the cps one to use it. but i've noticed that if csproj defined this way: xml <project> ...</project> it will load cps as well even if project type guid is kept as fae04ec0-301f-11d3-bf4b-00c04f79efbc . also i've noticed that projects created from class library .net standard template are using cps. could you clarify please how vs2017 determines when to use cps and when to use legacy project system? regards!
