 URL : "https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/issues/314" TITLE : zindex is not a function BODY : https://api.jqueryui.com/1.12/zindex/ seems that zindex was originally used only in datepicker, in 1.12 and probably older it has been renamed into datepicker_getzindex and made private. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/search?utf8=%e2%9c%93&q=datepicker_getzindex api documentation should be corrected.
