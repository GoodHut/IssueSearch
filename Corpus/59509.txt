 URL : "https://github.com/voutcn/megahit/issues/140" TITLE : uneven number of reads BODY : i am experiencing an issue when trying to assemble simulated paired-end files. megahit aborts right at the beginning and reports that the number of sequences not the same in paired files even though there is an equal number of reads lines in the two datasets. is there anything else that could be causing this issue?
