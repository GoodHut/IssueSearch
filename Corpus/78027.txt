 URL : "https://github.com/Data4Democracy/media-crawler/issues/8" TITLE : parse breitbart articles BODY : note: if you prefer to not work with this source, please leave it to other contributors. as far as we are concerned, all media is relevant from a research perspective. using the washingtonpost parser https://github.com/data4democracy/media-crawler/blob/master/crawler/crawler/parsers/washington_post.py as an example, we want to create another parser for this source. note: as of now, we only care to grab anchor tag <a> references. this will involve a few things: you will have to define the parser in its own submodule under crawler/crawler/parsers this parser will have to return a list of reference objects dicts in python , given a scrapy response these parser objects must have the following: 'href': the link within the anchor tag itself 'text': the text or item which the anchor tag wraps 'context': the paragraph <p> tag enclosing the given anchor tag's cleaned text. some sites may have various formats depending on article category or article age see this issue https://github.com/data4democracy/media-crawler/issues/4 . these will have to all be handled in the parser. it is fine if you do not catch this at first. sometimes older articles will only be referenced by older articles, and that is one crazy rabbit hole to try and go down in the initial stages. when submitting a pr for this, please include some sample references which you scraped from a source. we can work through cleaning it and getting it right if it comes down to it :
