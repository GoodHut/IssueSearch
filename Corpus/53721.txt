 URL : "https://github.com/danielepantaleone/b3-plugin-jumper/issues/4" TITLE : error making bot crash BODY : came across this error when trying to start your plugin https://hastebin.com/itecafoded.rb i was able to start the plugin by adding a to line 1093 where the error occurred but i don't think a cheap fix like that should be acceptable cause it still takes away a function from the plugin?
