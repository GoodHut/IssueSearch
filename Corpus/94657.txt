 URL : "https://github.com/universAAL/middleware/issues/454" TITLE : changing uri of a resource BODY : _originally opened: @alfiva 2014-12-18 12:35:06_ _originally closed: 2015-01-30 14:08:00_ i am almost sure the answer will be 'no', but...
is there any way to change the uri of an already created resource object? or at least make a copy of it with a different uri? i know uris must be unique and immutable but i am not dealing with &quot;ontologies&quot; in the situation i am in, i am just interested in handling the java objects. -- from: _this issue has been automatically imported from our old issue tracker_
