 URL : "https://github.com/neikeq/GodotSharp/issues/55" TITLE : how to debug BODY : is it currently possible to debug the c code? i assume we need to make a plugin for visual studio like unity did, because it can't debug mono apps out of the box as far as i'm aware. i tried using visual studio, monodevelop and rider, all with no luck, but maybe i just don't know how to set things up properly. did someone have any luck getting debugging to work in any ide? thanks for making this by the way!
