 URL : "https://github.com/CarbonLighthouse/test-props/issues/1" TITLE : default props improvements BODY : in a recent test i had to write this in order to set up a test. js const el, props = createel { getvizdata: spy , params: { sitename: 'test.sitename', intervalname: 'test.intervalname', scenarioname: 'test.scenarioname', vizname: 'test.vizname' } } ; which is fine, but there were a few improvements i thought of as i used this. 1. i needed to make a new spy because i learned that props were maintaining reference across two tests if they were setup in default props. perhaps a deepclone would fix this, worth investigating. if not, perhaps integrating better with sinon to say that if a prop is a sinon object we should clone it to ensure that it's not persisting across tests. the fix above of just making a new spy in the actual test rather than as a default prop is a good workaround for now. 2. i did not need to overwrite all of those params, the only param relevant to the test i was writing was vizname . this was necessary because our extension of props isn't deep, it only extends one level using object.assign it would be good to use a deep merge utility like lodash/merge to make it so this could be: js const el, props = createel {getvizdata: spy , params: {vizname: 'test.vizname'}} ; while saying all the defaults for the other params would still be intact.
