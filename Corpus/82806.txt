BODY : hi, i'm using this plugin in a project and i'm having an issue with the order in which atrules and decls are being seen by the css.walk callback function. in my case the css looks like: @svg-load icon_1 url icon_1.svg {} @svg-load icon_2 url icon_2.svg {} ... .icon-1 { background: svg-inline icon_1 50% no-repeat; } .icon-2 { background: svg-inline icon_2 50% no-repeat; } i am consistently seeing the error message: warning in ./~/css-loader?{ modules :true, importloaders :1, localidentname : hash:base64:12 , sourcemap :true, minimize :true}!./~/postcss-loader/lib!./app/components/iconcomponent/styles.css postcss-inline-svg: c:\...\app\components\iconcomponent\styles.css:xx:y icon_2 svg is not defined for the same icons each time across the project. i dug into the code a little and added some log lines in the node.type === 'atrule' && node.name === 'svg-load' and node.type === 'decl' && node.value.indexof 'svg-load ' !== -1 || node.value.indexof 'svg-inline ' !== -1 to check which was being hit first. i would expect the atrule to always come before the decl but isn't the case. i'm not sure if this an issue with how this library uses css.walk or that postcss's tokenizer is getting them in the wrong order. when i output the root object that postcss provides its clear that they come in the wrong order i.e not the order the css file specifies. i have a small fix for this library given that is expected from postcss. instead of using css.walk and checking the type i used css.walkatrules and css.walkdecls as two seperate commands. that solved my issue. however this depends on if the expected result from postcss is that the order of nodes in the root object is not guaranteed to be the same as defined in the css. thanks
