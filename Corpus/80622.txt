 URL : "https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim/issues/387" TITLE : unhelpful search results BODY : fuzzy finding with ctrlp often yields bad results. to work around this, i often preface a filename with the name of its parent directory. ironically, this defeats the purpose of fuzzy find. how can we improve search results, sorting, etc., so that the user's query more often gets a reasonable match?
