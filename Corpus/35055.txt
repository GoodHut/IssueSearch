 URL : "https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2/issues/3234" TITLE : dashlet external url BODY : i know that external urls can not be displayed in icingaweb2 dashboard, but it would nice to allow this, as sometimes we have different monitoring systems and we want to have an overview in one place. i know it will be difficult to fit other pages inside the dashlets but it would be nice to have and every rose has its thorn.
