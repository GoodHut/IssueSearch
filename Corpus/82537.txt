 URL : "https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-admin/issues/997" TITLE : admin editor enchancments BODY : in the first round of the community request brainstorming: ideas for a wysiwyg/markdown admin editor https://getgrav.org/forum !/general:brainstorming-ideas-for-a the overall wish is to have a drag'n'drop image upload method on the editor just like github or other editors already provide. i'm pretty sure it is doable and i therefore open this ticket. it is also an offline editing request so that the grav editor stores its content in the local storage of the browser, but i'm unsure whether this can be implemented easily without any big refactorings.
