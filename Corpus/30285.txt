 URL : "https://github.com/nylira/prism-break/issues/1765" TITLE : ostel.co looks dead BODY : the website https://ostel.co looks dead. this is the place to register for ostel.co sip accounts, web service recommended by prism-break here https://prism-break.org/en/all/ sip-servers https://prism-break.org/en/all/ video-voice i can't make my ostel.co sip account work either, that i created long ago. there seems to be a ostel.cc website with exactly the same content as ostel.co had, but i could not find any reference to it on official guardian project sites proving that it is legit and not a scam. after signing up there i received a welcome email from a ostel.cc@gmail.com email address, but using gmail seems suspect if supposed to originate from a privacy conscious organization. with my previous ostel.co sip account i received emails from them from the email address ostel@guardianproject.info. i couldn't make the sip account at ostel.cc work either after signing up. not sure what to think...
