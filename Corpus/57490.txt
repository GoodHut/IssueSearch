BODY : hello, thanks for this awesome work ! have you considered using path.py to wrapp os.path function ? https://pypi.python.org/pypi/path.py as code compacity and readability seems to be a major concern, it could be nice to use it. it's avalaible for python 2.7 and 3.5, os independent, and can be downloaded via pip. here is an example for imagefolder dataset : def make_dataset dir, class_to_idx : images = for target in os.listdir dir : d = os.path.join dir, target if not os.path.isdir d : continue for filename in os.listdir d : if is_image_file filename : path = '{0}/{1}'.format target, filename item = path, class_to_idx target images.append item return images and now with path.py wrapper : from path import path def make_dataset dir, class_to_idx : dir = path dir images = for d in dir.dirs : target = str d.basename for path in d.files : if path.ext in img_extensions: item = path, class_to_idx target images.append item return images maybe you considered it but still decided not to use it ? in that case why ? like not the accusing 'why', that is a genuine question as i am not very experienced for deploying big python frameworks
