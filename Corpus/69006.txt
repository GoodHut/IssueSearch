 URL : "https://github.com/blmstrm/clj-spotify/issues/8" TITLE : spotify wrapper listing BODY : hi! thanks so much for developing this wrapper for the spotify web api for clojure. i've just tried it out, it's working really well. i work for spotify, and i'm wondering if you'd be interested in having this project listed on our developer site https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/code-examples/ , alongside other spotify web api wrappers in other languages? best, hugh
