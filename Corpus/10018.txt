 URL : "https://github.com/mscrivo/OotD/issues/68" TITLE : add zoom control BODY : outlook itself provides a zoom control on the calendar. it would be useful to have this in ootd as well, as presently my day view shows mostly non-working hours: the ranges from 4 am to 9 am, and 5 pm to 11 pm take up about 2/3rds of the view. as a result, the part of my calendar that i actually care about is compressed. please see the attached image for an example. ! ootd https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16407528/23762045/ba2ea562-04a9-11e7-8ac7-9cd0d7e57e15.jpg
