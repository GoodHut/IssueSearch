 URL : "https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet/issues/445" TITLE : train facenet on caffe BODY : has anybody trained facenet on caffe? i trained facenet by tensorflow on ms_celeb_1m dataset and it works well,get 99.4% accuracy on lfw.but when i use inception_resnet_v2 on caffe,it didn't converge,the loss is always 10+ in 28k iterations. i don't know whether it makes some difference with bn,so i'll train the inception_resnet_v1 again. if anybody had successfully trained facenet on caffe,please @me,thanks a lot.
