BODY : hi team, i've just started using this os for few days, and i'm fancied by its simplicity! but just one problem: after the very first login followed a fresh installation, i don't need to enter password anymore! same thing occurs when it asks to authenticate to install packages is it that my user is an administrator, and no need of that password? ps: rebooting the system doesn't help much ps 2: i'm a fresh programmar, and very new to linux, so i don't know how to trace things back down have a good day!
