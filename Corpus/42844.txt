 URL : "https://github.com/EventStore/eventstore-docker/issues/23" TITLE : can't run projections BODY : my eventstore is not actually running projections. i am starting it with: docker run --name eventstore-node -it -p 2113:2113 -p 1113:1113 -e eventstore_run_projections=all eventstore/eventstore i also tried capital all . but my projects still do not actually run . i know this because my recently created streams is empty in the ui, as well as my projection's last position and checkpoint are both $ce-bee: -1 . when i run a standalone non-docker version with the following command, everything works as expected: sh run-node.sh --run-projections=all --start-standard-projections p.s.: start standard projections is also not available in docker it seems.
