 URL : "https://github.com/wdclem/Tea-Cozy/issues/2" TITLE : conventions for styling BODY : we generally want to keep all class and id names lower cased. your project was a great example as to why because one of your links in the nav isn't working featured tea . this mistake is due to the difference in naming conventions between the id capitalized and the href value of the anchor tag lower-cased . remember to be consistent with naming! all lower-case preferred.
