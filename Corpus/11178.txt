 URL : "https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/asibot-openrave-models/issues/3" TITLE : fix link lengths BODY : a thorough inspection of asibot in the simulator reveals that the 3d model appears longer than it should. specifically, the homogeneous, metallic area on outer links between joints 1-2 and 4-5 is thinner in the real robot. although easy to accomplish through a few tweaks in the xml files not in the .ivs , this issue depends on the outcome of 2 and is therefore blocked by now.
