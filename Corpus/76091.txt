 URL : "https://github.com/omega8cc/boa/issues/1119" TITLE : increasing memory limit. BODY : hi, i have looked through a range of articles on this topic and cannot seem to find one that deals specifically with increasing the memory limit in a recent version of boa. i tried adding these to local.settings.php in the sites folder ini_set 'max_execution_time',1000 ; ini_set 'memory_limit','512m' ; the execution time worked but the memory limit did not. i then tried updating the php.ini at /opt/php56/etc/php56.ini and then service php56-fpm reload when i view the php.info from the sites status report - it does not look like the memory limit changed at all can you please provide some guidance with how i would do this please thanks gregg
