 URL : "https://github.com/armory3d/armory/issues/268" TITLE : gamepad input not working BODY : on arch linux, getting input from gamepad is not working. tested an old usb controller kernel driver and a wireless xbox 360 controller xboxdrv driver http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/xboxdrv/ . none of them register any input when playing an armory project. neither the armory input class or using the kha input class worked when testing the armory project. however, both work fine in a separate minimal kha project. minimal kha project that works for me: input_test.zip https://github.com/armory3d/armory/files/1362836/input_test.zip
