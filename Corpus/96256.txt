 URL : "https://github.com/dgoerger/workstation/issues/23" TITLE : eradicate version pinnings BODY : there are version pinnings in e.g. rpmfusion.rb, gdm/dconf/site_settings, python.rb, leaving hard references to e.g. f27 vs f26 vs each release of fedora. this is maintenance nightmare, and limits the usefulness of project head to only one release at a time. todo: scan the tree and remove all hard version pinnings where possible and appropriate.
