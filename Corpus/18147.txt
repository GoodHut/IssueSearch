 URL : "https://github.com/ZeroK-RTS/Zero-K/issues/2184" TITLE : some cofc issues. BODY : here are some issues with cofc: it is possible to rotate the screen by holding the middle mouse button as well as ctrl or alt. the middle click drag scroll is too fast. the mouse cursor is supposed to stay static relative to the terrain. pressing tab causes the camera to enter overview mode. tab is no longer a camera hotkey. it is possible to zoom underwater but any camera movement will cause the camera to snap back to the top of the water. ideally no underwater zoom would be allowed. there could be an option to add some fully functioning underwater camera behaviour. if you disable zoom out to center and zoom out further when at maximum zoom the camera is scrolled such that the map moves down on my screen.. tilting with ctrl has some sort of axis of rotation lag which makes it sickening. tilting with ctrl has a reversed scroll wheel. it's looking better than last time i tried it. the tilt zoom is significantly less jerky and sickening.
