 URL : "https://github.com/sul-dlss/WASMetadataExtractor/issues/7" TITLE : deploy with capistrano? BODY : would it be possible and/or make sense if we deploying this code to the was-robots vms via capistrano? and then the robot code either looked for the jar at execution time, or there was a way to copy or symlink the jar into the robot code during a robot deploy and/or a was-md-extractor deploy?
