 URL : "https://github.com/sociomantic-tsunami/ebtree/issues/10" TITLE : fix deploy error BODY : when deploying to bintray, travis complains https://travis-ci.org/sociomantic-tsunami/ebtree/jobs/241290054 l229 about: error: you must specify -t tag if $travis_tag is not present! which is totally weird. this makes me think though, that we need to run this inside docker, otherwise the jfrog tool wont be there i thoought i tested this! maybe travis provides the tool in the vm? . in any case is weird that the $travis_tag is empty, it seems to work fine in cachalot https://github.com/sociomantic-tsunami/cachalot/tree/v2 .
