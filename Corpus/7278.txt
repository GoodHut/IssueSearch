 URL : "https://github.com/dceejay/RedMap/issues/25" TITLE : fa icon pointer BODY : the fa icons are a welcome addition but are all shown with a small square which i assume is meant to point to the lat/long location. 2 issues with this pointer: 1. it detracts from the look or more bluntly it is ugly, particularly where there are many icons in close proximity. 2. if it is indeed meant to be a pointer then it is not accurate. it does not quite point to the same location as the non-fa icon.
