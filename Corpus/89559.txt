 URL : "https://github.com/richfitz/remake/issues/147" TITLE : r6 class definition fails BODY : i tried to have remake include another yml file that has sources defining an r6 class. r6 is included in the packages section but i get an error that r6class is not found. to reproduce just clone the repo: https://github.com/sakrejda/remake-fail.git then run remake::make from the remake-fail directory, you will get something like: sph-ksakrejda:whut krzysztof$ rscript -e 'remake::make ' load read | loading sources error: while sourcing 'scripts/data-processing/time-schemes.r': could not find function r6class execution halted i'm pretty sure i'm just not understanding some of the restrictions on remake but it's not clear to me why this is happening.
