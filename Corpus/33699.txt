 URL : "https://github.com/vollstock/Tooloop-OS/issues/3" TITLE : amd driver installer BODY : thereâ€™s working code to install the amd pro drivers in files/scripts/tooloop-install-optional-stuff . however, the direct download link provided here https://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/pages/amdgpu-pro-install.aspx does not work using wget and thus we can't download it from the script. it works in the browser, though. how can we provide the driver? can we legally deploy it ourselves?
