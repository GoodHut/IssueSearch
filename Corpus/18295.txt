 URL : "https://github.com/cablehead/python-consul/issues/178" TITLE : support consul 1+ BODY : consul has now hit version 1.0.0, and as part of this release they have made the accepted http verbs for various endpoints much stricter https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/blob/master/changelog.md 100-october-16-2017 . this breaks parts of this library. the particular example i have found is that the agent.check.ttl_pass and agent.check.ttl_fail functions don't work as they use get requests and those endpoints now only support put requests. i'm sure there will be more examples of breakages caused by this change.
