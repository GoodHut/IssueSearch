 URL : "https://github.com/Kwarrtz/render/issues/12" TITLE : new incarnation of library BODY : hi @kwarrtz, in search of drawing functionality for elm, i encountered your excellent library. because i read you're not planning to support it any more, and i needed automatic positioning functions like the haskell diagrams library https://archives.haskell.org/projects.haskell.org/diagrams/ provides, i created a fork and started experimenting. you can find the result on the elm package site http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/timjs/elm-collage/latest . i'm planning to support and extend the library in the time to come. if you'll have some time, i very much appreciate your opinion on the changes i made: naming, functionality, usage etc. please feel free to contact me or open an issue on the github repository https://github.com/timjs/elm-collage/tree/1.0.1 ! the most notable changes are as follows: - the coordinate system is again in the middle of the canvas, x pointing right, y pointing up, as in your first version. i'm curious to the reason you decided to change this in version 2.0. - form is renamed to collage . - there is a module with a whole bunch of layout functions for automatic positioning, loosely based on @vilterp's outdated elm diagrams library http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/vilterp/elm-diagrams/latest . - different way of handling line styles solid , dot , dash , etc. - extended functionality for text in a separate module. - events in a separate module. i hope you'll find some time to give some feedback!
