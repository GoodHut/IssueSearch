 URL : "https://github.com/levlaz/circleci.py/issues/6" TITLE : implement public api BODY : right now the api requires a token for all requests. however, per the docs foss https://circleci.com/docs/api/v1-reference/ foss projects are accessible via the api in a read only state. this might be useful for some folks so we should make the token an optional argument when the api class initializes.
