 URL : "https://github.com/FlorianRappl/Mages/issues/84" TITLE : plugin overloaded methods BODY : question: is it possible to use overloaded methods within plugins? looking at the filefunctions of the filesystem plugin it looked like it should be but after some brief testing that would seem to not be the case. for instance, if i have the following custom plugin functions: public static string test_overload string input { return overload 1 ; } public static string test_overload double input {return overload 2 ; } and call the following: engine.interpret test_overload 4.56 it will _always_ print overload 1 . could be totally off base with this as well so any help would be greatly appreciated! /cc @florianrappl
