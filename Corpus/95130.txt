 URL : "https://github.com/hirofumi0810/asr_preprocessing/issues/2" TITLE : couple of easy to fix bugs BODY : 1 in wav2feature_librosa.py and wav2feature_python_speech_features.py delta1 does not get initialized if use_delta1 is true and use_delta2 is false. 2 when preprocessing only libri-speech-100 a character.txt file does not get created. my workaround was that i preprocessed train_all but fixed the paths so only the ones from libri-speech-100 would get used.
