 URL : "https://github.com/paritytech/parity/issues/5760" TITLE : mirror & slave peer modes BODY : possibility to configure one or more peers as not just reserved, but also mirrored. in this case, all transactions and blocks would always instantly be sent to that peer after validation, the idea being to maximise the chances of a state root that they agree on. later variant of this feature slave would include an additional par protocol addition: sealingblock , which would provide an unsealed block on which the receiving peer could mine. you would use --slave <enode> and have a handshake flag that would alert the other node to send sealingblock messages. in this mode you'd only mine on the last sealingblock item received.
