 URL : "https://github.com/kriskowal/q/issues/821" TITLE : q.all inside q.all BODY : i have small problem. that's my code: q.all array.map somefunction .then function { console.log end ; } ; function somefunction array_item { var deferred = q.defer ; //there is some operations with array_item does not apply to the problem and then: q.all array.map someanotherfunction .then function { deferred.resolve ; } ; return deferred.promise; } function someanotherfunction array_item { var deferred = q.defer ; //there is some operations with array_item does not apply to the problem and then: q.all array.map onemorefunction .then function { deferred.resolve ; } ; return deferred.promise; } function someanotherfunction array_item { var deferred = q.defer ; //some async function with deferred.resolve ; return deferred.promise; } so basically my code working perfect. but it becomes silent at the somefunction. i will try to explain. after start of execution i see console.log end ; immediately. and then knowing promises nature all promises get in the queue until script comes through all functions. i believe i can fix my problem by pasting each q.all call to the previous function then callback. but i can't do it because of specific chain of execution. so how can i rewrite my code so chain will be the same. p.s. sorry for this issue. you can close it if it really awful. i will try to find the fix by myself.
