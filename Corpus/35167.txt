 URL : "https://github.com/electricjs/electric/issues/81" TITLE : deploy task is flaky BODY : a few issues i've noticed. - config options for setting remote don't work properly can only get it to deploy to my origin . - when latest commit is a merge commit, some transitive dependency of gulp-gh-pages throws an error. the proposed fix is to replace the gulp-gh-pages dependency with the gh-pages dependency. note that gulp-gh-pages is not just a wrapper for gh-pages . they are two different solutions.
