 URL : "https://github.com/dogtools/dog/issues/117" TITLE : add debug mode BODY : debug mode is triggered by the -d/--debug flag. the result of enabling debug mode is that the following information is printed on stderr as a first step of dog execution: - dog version - current directory full path - info mode provideextrainfo , enabled or disabled? right after parsing the dogfile print: - list of parsed dogfiles full paths right after constructing a task chain print: - ordered list of tasks in the task chain all this information would help a lot when there is a runtime error on parsing a dogfile or when generating a task chain.
