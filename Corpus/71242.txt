 URL : "https://github.com/18F/django-email-pal/issues/4" TITLE : add a send_mail function BODY : in calc, the send_mail https://github.com/18f/calc/blob/develop/data_capture/email.py l73 function renders both the plaintext and html version of an email and also sets a reply-to header. we might want to provide something slightly different or more extensible in this package, but fundamentally it should aid users in rendering both versions of an email and making it easy to send.
