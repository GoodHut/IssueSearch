 URL : "https://github.com/skatejs/web-components/issues/46" TITLE : native-shim has to be es6 BODY : looking at https://github.com/skatejs/web-components/blob/master/src/index.js l16 it seems like native-shim.js is always required, but as i understand it this file must remain es6 or it won't work in chrome. how do you deal with a situation where the user wants to transpile these polyfills to es5 but selectively exclude native-shim.js ?
