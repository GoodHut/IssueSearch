 URL : "https://github.com/kestrelm/Creature_Unity/issues/6" TITLE : unity layers override BODY : it has been added the functionality of overriding an animation for certain bones useful in runner games, where we have a layer for the arms shooting and the lower layer for the body but this is accessible only via code. in unity in mecanim there is already a layer system where one can set override/additive layer where you can set the animation on different layers and it the upper layer has an animation just for the arms it will automatically override the animation for the arms at the lower layer. it would be cool to make use of this in mecanim instead of the code.
