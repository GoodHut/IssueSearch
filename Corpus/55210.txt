 URL : "https://github.com/rebeccaeverson/tb-to-tex/issues/1" TITLE : improve parsing errors BODY : make parsing errors more informative specify the lexeme, the missing/out of place field, etc. to make 'debugging' the dictionary data less painful. also add a try/catch block to the runtbtotex file to stop any latex formatting from happening if the script fails. currently, it just exists the process running the python program if it errors and jumps right into trying to format.
