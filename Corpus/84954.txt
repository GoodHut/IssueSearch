 URL : "https://github.com/algolia/docsearch/issues/178" TITLE : duplicated search results BODY : do you want to request a feature or report a bug ? bug? what is the current behavior? recently merge a pr https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms-www/pull/19 to add docs search to one of my company's projects, but it seems like our search results are getting duplicated. my first assumption is that the docsearch api is scraping our nav menu in addition to the page titles. https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms-www https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/ ! https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1050/25159541/47c6f336-2465-11e7-9079-b7131cfd0810.png what is the expected behavior? is possible to exclude the nav menu in the scrape or at least suppress the duplicated search results?
