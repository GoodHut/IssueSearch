 URL : "https://github.com/nestjs/nest/issues/317" TITLE : how to print errors BODY : hey, just a quick support request: i have made a mistake now my app throws an error: nest 28 - 2017-12-20 17:13:56 exceptionshandler object object this log is of course pretty useless although nicely colored . so i've tried overwriting the logging in my server.ts: app.useglobalfilters { catch: e: any, res: any => { console.error e ; res.status 500 .send e ; } } ;
