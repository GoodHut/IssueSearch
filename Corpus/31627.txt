 URL : "https://github.com/asf-stripe/okhttp-code2040/issues/1" TITLE : stop redirect loops BODY : it's possible for a misconfigured http server to redirect /a to /b and /b back to /a . most http clients stop following redirects after a few. we've arbitrarily chosen 20 in the failing test at 0f292f422d97886570fe4f78635878e17c19f532. you can run only this test with mvn test -dsurefire.usefile=false '-dtest=calltest doesnotfollow21redirects' -dfailifnotests=false make sure the follow20redirects test continues to pass. intellij idea tips: make sure you run mvn generate-sources before opening in idea. if you're reading this too late, right-click the okhttp project > maven > generate sources and update folders.
