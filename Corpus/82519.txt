 URL : "https://github.com/nodejs/help/issues/811" TITLE : addons vs child processes BODY : versions 4->8 : runtime : hi, i have looked through the guides and docs, but couldnt find an answer to this question: which situation is best to use an addon vs using a child process ? - how much overhead does child process spawning have ? - do addons have the potential to block the main node thread ? - how can i use threading in each ? i saw i can use libuv worker threads in addons ? - how do they compare with long function processing times and high volumes of requests ? any help pointing me to this info would be great. thanks sean
