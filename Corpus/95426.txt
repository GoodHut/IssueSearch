 URL : "https://github.com/nluedtke/linux_kernel_cves/issues/6" TITLE : cves caused by backporting BODY : several cves mostly early ones were caused by backporting commits. how will we handle these? do we created a separate flag for this type of thing. for instance commit b was back ported to streams x,y where they caused a security issue in x,y but not in the stream that the commit was originally applied for. this will require some thought.
