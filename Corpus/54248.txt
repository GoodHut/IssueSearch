 URL : "https://github.com/craigsimps/gulp-wp-toolkit/issues/19" TITLE : fix style file headers BODY : right now, the generated style.css file headers are inflexible. tags: and domain path are missing, and themes would be forced to have a template: genesis , even if the toolkit was used on a non-child theme. the default values in the the toolkits config.js are mostly worthless, as not overriding them in the theme's extendconfig means that info from the toolkits package.json i.e. author = craig simpson would be added.
