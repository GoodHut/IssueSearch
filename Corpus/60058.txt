 URL : "https://github.com/rwieruch/minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup/issues/4" TITLE : webpack 1 to webpack 3 BODY : maybe it is time to update the boilerplate project to webpack 3. i would love to keep it minimal like it is right now, but just with the necessary technical upgrade under the hood. in another repository there has been such an upgrade to webpack 3 https://github.com/rwieruch/favesound-redux/pull/99 . maybe it's a great blueprint to upgrade this boilerplate project too. - upgrade minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup https://github.com/rwieruch/minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup/ to webpack 3 maybe in a follow up pr i can upgrade the documentation for it too: - the minimal react webpack babel setup https://github.com/rwieruch/blog_robinwieruch_content/blob/master/minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup.md - react code style with eslint + babel + webpack https://github.com/rwieruch/blog_robinwieruch_content/blob/master/react-eslint-webpack-babel.md
