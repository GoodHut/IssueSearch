 URL : "https://github.com/TntMatthew/dcli/issues/13" TITLE : make /whois work in dms BODY : it doesn't work in dms right now since in discord.py, member objects have status info, but user objects don't. the solution for this would be to try and get a member object for that user from one of the servers you're in, and return offline if they aren't in a server with you - i believe this is what the official client does. i've just been too lazy to try implementing this.
