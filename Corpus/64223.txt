 URL : "https://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot/issues/1076" TITLE : follow the conversation BODY : hi there. first i love this work! well done! probably i did not found the right settings. but i asked me if there is an option to follow the conversation if possible. in example: i have questions in my corpora that can be answered with a simple yes or a no in my case it replies depending on the strategy bestmatch or random even with a session just something out of the possible answers to yes and no . but it takes not care of the previous conversation. training sample: a: hi b: hello a: are you hungry? b: yes a: then lets eat something a: hello b: hi a: are you happy? b: yes a: nice! if i follow now the first conversation it is more or less luck if i have the right answer. is there a trick or should i work on this feature. or am i the only one with this issue? regards mario
