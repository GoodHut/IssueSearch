 URL : "https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/issues/1202" TITLE : custom navigation actions BODY : how do i declare and call custom navigation actions? the documentation isn't a big help, especially since dispatch was removed from the documentation as an action. i am using nested navigators and i want to give my routes keys, so that the screens are not rendered on top of each other. custom actions seem to be the only way to achieve this, but if i'm wrong i would happily accept a different solution ðŸ˜ƒ
