 URL : "https://github.com/craigbarnes/dte/issues/68" TITLE : add test coverage BODY : the test-main.c file inherited from dex is a good starting point for a unit testing framework, but it currently has almost no test coverage. it should be moved to a new test/ directory and coverage for each source file in src/ .c should eventually have corresponding unit tests in test/test_ .c . another useful addition would be to add a command-line option to disable the restrictions on commands allowed within config files. it should then be possible to automate the testing of every command and also add regression tests for old bugs that previously required manual user input. the gcc/clang address , leak and undefined sanitizers could also be used to catch any latent bugs or memory leaks. test-main.c : https://github.com/craigbarnes/dte/blob/ca90d1ade2c9e6943cb1ac5cd6ee6e04c5d00e2d/src/test-main.c dex : https://github.com/tihirvon/dex/blob/master/test-main.c restrictions : https://github.com/craigbarnes/dte/blob/ca90d1ade2c9e6943cb1ac5cd6ee6e04c5d00e2d/src/run.c l9-l34
