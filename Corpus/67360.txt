 URL : "https://github.com/raim/SBML_odeSolver/issues/2" TITLE : please add release tags BODY : hi, i would consider maintaining this project as debian package. however, i have no sensible clue what version number to use and i also have no good way to realise new versions that are intended for user consumption. it would be nice if you could add tags to specify releases which would fix this. kind regards, andreas.
