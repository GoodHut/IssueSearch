BODY : is it just me, or did something break? for a few days, the releases tab doesn't show up anymore for any repo including this on all of my machines linux at home, windows at work, 1 at ff54, 2 at ff55 . in the latter place on windows, it's version 17.8.22.1346 and seems to have updated today â€“ if it helps, i can check my other machines later when i've returned home.
