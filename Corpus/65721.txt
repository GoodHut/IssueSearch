 URL : "https://github.com/kosmtik/kosmtik/issues/244" TITLE : kosmtik on ubuntu 16.04 BODY : i tried to get kosmtik to work on ubuntu 16.04 lts there are some hoops to jump through it seems, so i suggest to add them to the readme. i took following steps to get it to run: apt-get install nodejs-legacy npm libmapnik-dev npm install kosmtik ln -s ../ node_modules/kosmtik/node_modules the symlink is necessary, because on that version of ubuntu, the directory layout is different than expected by kosmtik. all modules are installed to the parent directory of kosmtik. the symlink emulates those modules being installed in a directory called node modules inside the kosmtik directory.
