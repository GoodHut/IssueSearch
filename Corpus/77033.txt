 URL : "https://github.com/rniemeyer/knockout-classBindingProvider/issues/26" TITLE : missing $element binding BODY : i notice that the context parameter in the binding function has no $element property listed among the other properties like $data, $parent, etc. is it possible to reference the dom element another way? var bindings = { question: function context, classes { --- i want to set the ko.css binding on the dom element but there is no context.$element --- } } <div data-class= question ></div> this library has been a godsend in a project i've been working on so thank you.
