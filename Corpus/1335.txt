 URL : "https://github.com/LSSTDESC/PZDC1paper/issues/14" TITLE : rmse of p z BODY : i'm not sure that the rmse tells us much about the individual pdfs. in the first place we should define what we want to consider as the pdf of the true redshift, a pdf in which all the values are 0 with the exception of the bin of zspec? or a gaussian pdf centered on zpsec and a width related to the error? but in any case i'm not convinced that the average of those values tells something about the pdfs. on the other hand we could perform it on the stacked pdfs, but again we should decide what is the pdf of true redshift would be, and in principle i think that other indicator could be better for such purpose, what is your opinion?
