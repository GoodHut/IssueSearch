 URL : "https://github.com/cbrevik/webview-native-config-example/issues/1" TITLE : problem on rn 0.50.3 BODY : great addition btw, i'd like to see this kind of thing get into other components. you might have seen facebook/react-native/ 16848 about 'unsupported top level event type toploadingstart dispatched'. i eventually noticed your example repo and it demonstrates the same issue with react-native 0.50.3 also with v0.51.0-rc.2 i don't quite understand exactly what is going on in the rctcomponentdata where it is adding top to the events and so on, but it seems like there is something not being configured at the right time there.
