 URL : "https://github.com/kevinongko/vue-numeric/issues/2" TITLE : allow decimals points BODY : hi @kevinongko i really love this component but as you can image if you are working with a field of price probably you will need to support decimals points and make it configurable the number of decimals allowed because at this moment with component only works with integers. i would like something like this: vue <vue-numeric currency= $ separator= , decimals= 2 v-model= price ></vue-numeric> my issue right now is that i want to type 11.99 but i get 1,199 cheers
