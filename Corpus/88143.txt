 URL : "https://github.com/ryanlintott/SSVEP_keyboard/issues/22" TITLE : more frequency resolution BODY : i have already decreased the sample rate to try to get more resolution. this decreased from 44100 to 22050 to 11025 but this is the lower limit. instead of altering the sample rate i could instead alter the pitch of the tone we're looking for to spread it out across more frequencies. by increasing the pitch from 1 to 2 i could move the 1khz tone to 2khz and therefor the 1,015hz and 1,020hz to 2,030hz and 2,040hz. as i have up to half the sample rate to work with it would help to spread out these frequencies i'm looking for across more buckets.
