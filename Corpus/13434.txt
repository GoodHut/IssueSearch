 URL : "https://github.com/uccser/verto/issues/241" TITLE : update image tag BODY : to make creating/editing/translating images more user friendly, the following change needs to be implemented: currently an image looks like this: {image file-path= http://placehold.it/350x150 caption= description of the image. } and the suggested change is: {image file-path= http://placehold.it/350x150 caption= true } description of the image. {image end} where the caption is the text between the blocks only if caption is true . there are multiple other parameters that the image tag uses e.g. alt, alignment, hover-text, etc but we have decided to pull the caption out as this the most obvious user facing text and therefore want to make it easy for editors to make changes. this is only the suggested solution and is up for discussion e.g. do we need to specify caption= true ? what happens when there is no caption, do we still use {image end} or make it an inline processor? cc @jackmorgannz @jordangriffiths01
