 URL : "https://github.com/hea3ven/BuildingBricks/issues/101" TITLE : port to 1.12? BODY : hi hea3ven, i have been watching a lot of darkosto's streams on twitch lately and he is about to add permanent stepup into his mod. i think it is ridiculous to automatically step up 1 meter at a time. is there any way you can update your mod to 1.12 so that he can add it into the pack he is making for sevadus? i would really appreciate it. - ridgure
