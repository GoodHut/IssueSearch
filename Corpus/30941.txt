 URL : "https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/issues/2467" TITLE : remove set polyfill BODY : we're currently polyfilling set for everyone, really only to support distinct . i'd like in the spirit of 2407, i'd liek to propose removing the set polyfill entirely, placing the onus on developers targeting ie10 and lower to provide their own polyfill. pros 1. smaller library size 2. less to maintain 3. i suspect the native set impls may have better performance 4. all modern browsers support set, it seems cons 1. definitely a breaking change 2. i'm unsure if there are any quirks to this functionality between browser versions in the wild. 3. might hurt more esoteric js runtime targets ala smarttvs at netflix?
