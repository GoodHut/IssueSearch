 URL : "https://github.com/LWSS/AimTux/issues/8" TITLE : closestbone is broken now BODY : closestbone seems to be broken after the new update. 1.when using low fov,it doesn't work for me.i enabled all the bones and it can't aim anymore. 2.when using 180 degree fov,bones seems to be fixed.for example,you aim at head and press the aimkey,aimbot will move your crosshair to enemy's leg.it is so annoying. p.s. my english is really bad,but i hope you will understand my words.a lot of appreciations to all aimtux contributors!although mcswaggen no longer update the original aimtux,there's still many active forks of it.your fork is the best opensource fork,and you're kind to users like me.give my respect to you!
