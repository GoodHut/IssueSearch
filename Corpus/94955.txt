 URL : "https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/first-lab/issues/32" TITLE : completion not registering BODY : i believe i've completed this lab, but it does not seem to have registered on learn.co so i am unable to proceed. i'm not sure if i did something incorrectly at some stage, since i did have to open the lab in the learn ide in order for the 'learn' command to work. any advice regarding mistakes i may have made as well as input on how to proceed would be appreciated.
