original assignee: chad berkley --- the eml-entity module has a field called entitytype that is supposed to contain the type of the entity for other entities. the eml-physical file has a field called format that is supposed to contain the name of the data forat for the physical file. we need to clarify the difference between these fields. if one is using a mime-type to indicate the format e.g., image/gif , where should that go? my guess is eml-physical/format.
