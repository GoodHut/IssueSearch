 URL : "https://github.com/cdd/bioassay-template/issues/35" TITLE : template veracity check BODY : it is currently a little to easy to make templates that have mistakes that will cause problems when they are used. for example, property/group uris that are missing or malformed; property/group uris that are duplicated within their context; assignments that are expecting a tree of uri values but have none, or none that are valid, etc. there should be a verification scan for these errors; it should probably be user-initiated e.g. in a menu, which brings up a report of problems , but it could be integrated more deeply into the ui e.g. a warning notifier .
