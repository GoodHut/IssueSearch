 URL : "https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-javascript-driver/issues/292" TITLE : bolt driver with promises BODY : looking at the driver documentation, i'm seeing a callback example, but no promises: var driver = neo4j.driver bolt://localhost , neo4j.auth.basic neo4j , neo4j ; // register a callback to know if driver creation was successful: driver.oncompleted = function { // proceed with using the driver, it was successfully instantiated }; is there a way to promisify this driver method to return a promise? bluebird promisify work? is this callback approach still the recommended practice? thanks,
