 URL : "https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips/issues/833" TITLE : github release function BODY : hello, i wonder why there haven't been a release since december 2015? is there any reason for this? it would be nice if you could continue the old behaviour of the old maintainer and use the release function. many distributions get their releases via this function. thanks in advance
