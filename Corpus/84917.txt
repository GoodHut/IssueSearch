 URL : "https://github.com/devongovett/pdfkit/issues/765" TITLE : draw border around images BODY : dear @devongovett thanks for the fantastic library! my question is: i am currently trying to add a border to images - so i searched for something like widthofimage / heighofimage to get the dimensions of placed / included images within the document that get placed like that: doc.image 'image.png', 20, 30, { fit: 400, 300 , align: 'center' } ; is there a way to get the image dimensions in order to use them to draw a rectangle over the image or another way to add borders? best, marco.
