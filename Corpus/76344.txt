 URL : "https://github.com/grupoversia/cis-ubuntu-ansible/issues/16" TITLE : issue with pam_tally2.so BODY : for some reason after adding auth required pam_tally2.so onerr=fail audit silent deny=5 unlock_time=900 into common-auth i start getting errors that the password doesn't work and i can't login anymore. i did extensive testing and got it done to this exact line causing the error. it seems to be something with the way sudo works with the fail counter. has anybody found a way around it?
