 URL : "https://github.com/bigjosh/Move38-Arduino-Platform/issues/3" TITLE : better color data model? BODY : can we get away with a uint16 for color? need to empirically test to see what is visible. maybe 5 bits each for r,g,b? what can we use the last bit for? blinking? if we can get more bits back, maybe have several automatic modes like fast blink, slow blink, fast breathe, slow breath?
