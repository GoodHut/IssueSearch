 URL : "https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues/5271" TITLE : flow consumes all memory BODY : when flow is run, it searches for the file .flowconfig. if it isn't found in the current directory, flow searches upward through all ancestor directories until it is found. then the runs flow on all javascript files in that directory and all directories below it. but what happens when .flowconfig is never found? the answer is that it stops looking when the home directory is reached and then runs flow on every file under the home directory. you can tell this has happened because the fan in your computer will start making a noise like a jet engine. this will consume all memory on the computer and it will lock up. many of us have our editors/ides to automatically run flow on javascript files. in my case this happens using the vim plugin ale. this is frequently what initiates the problem for me. this seems like such as easy fix. all that has to change is to make it so flow does not run if no .flowconfig file is found. are there any reasons why this isn't a desirable change?
