 URL : "https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-docs/issues/334" TITLE : deploy webpart updates BODY : category - x question - typo - bug - enhancement / suggestion - additional article idea desired behavior i would love to have the possibility to update a webpart on the cdn without the need to re-upload the .spapp to sharepoint observed behavior when i run gulp --ship it creates a new bundle in .\temp\deploy with a filename different from the previous one . i deploy this to azure gulp deploy-azure-storage --ship , but now my sharepoint package is still pointing to the old bundle file. so now i have to create a new .spapp and upload it to sharepoint. not a big problem for now, but in the near future i would like to upload this package to multiple sharepoint tenants. so it would be great if i could deploy updates for all tenants at once. possible solutions i could think of a these solutions: - rename the bundle before deploying to the cdn - automate the uploading of the .spapp but i can imagine someone already thought about this and this is already possible.
