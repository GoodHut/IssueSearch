 URL : "https://github.com/YeoLab/clipper/issues/56" TITLE : no peaks detected BODY : hello, i used the previous version of the clipper on my data back in august of 2015 and it gave me very nice results. i would like to repeat this analysis with the new clipper so my output mirrors the output on encode. the clipper was installed on our cluster and i input my bam file. it came back reporting that no peaks had been found. i loaded the bam file into ucsc to assure myself that they had not vanished, they are indeed there. i then took a test bam file from this folder and loaded it in. hershbc@cc-dclrilog52 lustre $ clipper -b allup_test.bam -s hg19 -o luc7l2peaks.bed -g luc7l2 --plot --debug no peaks detected in dataset i'm assuming this file should have peaks in it, but i may be wrong. can someone help me solve this problem? thank you, courtney
