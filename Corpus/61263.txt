 URL : "https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/10844" TITLE : amp accordion extension BODY : what's the issue? it's nice if you can provide a way do below things: 1. use events to contral amp-accordion actions, like tap.myaccordion.closeall 2. when open one section, close others. 3. the scrollto action can't use in accordion title, i want when i expand one section, scroll this section to page top, it looks like more clear, if i have a lot of sections, and the content is very long in mobile.
