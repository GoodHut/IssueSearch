 URL : "https://github.com/aspnetboilerplate/aspnetboilerplate/issues/2364" TITLE : fr specification changes BODY : specifications are a really great idea. i'd like to use them more extensively. 1 i would like to make them faster. i made this: public class specification<t> : abp.specifications.specification<t> { private expression<func<t, bool>> exp; public specification expression<func<t, bool>> expin : base { exp = expin; } public override expression<func<t, bool>> toexpression { return exp; } } and it works well, could you add this constructor to the specification class? sorry i don't have 2017 so i cannot open and edit the project to do a pr it allows one to do the following public class coreshipmentspecificationprovider : ishipmentspecificationprovider { public virtual ispecification<出荷実績> getall { return new specification<出荷実績> shipment => shipment.isdeleted == false ; } public virtual ispecification<出荷実績> geteditable { return new specification<出荷実績> shipment => shipment.isdeleted == false && shipment.請求書ｉｄ == null && shipment.納品書印刷フラグ == false && shipment.請求書明細印刷フラグ == false ; } public virtual ispecification<出荷実績> getdeletable { return getall .and new specification<出荷実績> shipment => shipment.isdeleted == false ; } }
