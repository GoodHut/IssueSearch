 URL : "https://github.com/cerberustesting/cerberus-source/issues/1289" TITLE : robot full screen BODY : hi, noticed that running a testcase with a robot set to use fullscreen resolution the execution shows 768 529 in screen size. http://cerberus.siege.red/cerberus/executiondetail2.jsp?executionid=45524420 running the same testcase with a robot set to 1024 768 the execution shows 1024 768 http://cerberus.siege.red/cerberus/executiondetail2.jsp?executionid=45524727 the machine resolution is 1024x768, so should fullscreen or 1024 768 be the same? thanks!
