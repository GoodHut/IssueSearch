 URL : "https://github.com/dotnet/docfx/issues/1346" TITLE : improve error handling BODY : title when docfx fails, it is very hard to figure out even what project was the cause and a single failing project will immediately abort the whole process. functional impact makes it hard to debug problems. minimal repro steps anything that causes docfx to fail to process expected result docfx to catch and log exceptions on problematic projects, indicating clearly what projects failed, but continue processing remaining projects. actual result see the output from https://github.com/dotnet/docfx/issues/1345 as an example.
