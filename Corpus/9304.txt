 URL : "https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign/issues/1903" TITLE : updated sandbox BODY : i hope it's ok to post this here as it's not an issue but, for the few that were using or interested in my sandbox, i've just finished giving it a major overhaul and it can now be found at http://mdi.houseofdesign.ie/. i've given it a bit more of a material-y look, changed the colouring to match that of the mdi site and made it easier to access some of the features, such as direct linking to categories & search results. the vast majority of the work was behind the scenes with the javascript being rewritten from scratch and loaded chock full of es6 goodies! for that reason, i'm afraid it's chrome only. i'll also be adding the ability to export/import favourites from localstorage soon. once that's done, the main focus will be on categorising tagging and aliasing everything and feeding that work back into the mdi project. anyway, hopefully someone will find it useful. feedback would be most welcome. oh, and, as an added bonus ... shazam http://mdi.houseofdesign.ie/light/ !
