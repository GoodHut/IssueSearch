 URL : "https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxelib/issues/389" TITLE : haxelib --quiet install BODY : i'm using haxelib in travis https://github.com/jtransc/jtransc/pull/236 issuecomment-321368128 but the progress of the downloading part occupies like 80% of the whole log, and travis takes a lot of time to load because of that. can you make the --quiet to not display progress? or display it less frequently? or add another option to no display anything at all?
