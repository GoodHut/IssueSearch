 URL : "https://github.com/rborn/nativescript-i18n/issues/47" TITLE : nativescript 3.0.0 support BODY : creating an issue so we can track support readiness for nativescript 3.0.0. i've identified at least one thing in my local testing that needs to be changed to make this plugin work with 3.0.0. there might be more. - change references to application.resources to use new api application.getresources will submit a pr for issues that i can address if they don't get patched first. hopefully we can have full support for 3.0.0 before it ships in a couple weeks.
