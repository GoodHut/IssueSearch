 URL : "https://github.com/rowanj/gitx/issues/468" TITLE : single file history? BODY : not sure if this is the right place for this... i started using your forked version of gitx after upgrading to sierra and finding the original version no longer worked. something i used to do all the time in that version was looking at the history of a single file with the following command: gitx -- path/to/file . that will still open gitx but it doesn't seem to show the history of the single file. i am wondering if this is an actual issue or if i am just missing something. that feature was so powerful in resolving issues in projects and i am really missing it.
