 URL : "https://github.com/gradle-guides/writing-gradle-plugins-in-java/issues/2" TITLE : improve the introduction BODY : there are two sentences in the introduction that i find a little bit problematic. > the core of gradle provides an infrastructure for building anything, but plugins are what allow build users to get things done with a minimum of effort. what is the minimum of effort referring too? i'd assume applying and configuring a plugin once it exists. since this is a guide about writing plugins one could read it was referring to the activity of writing plugins. > they can apply conventions, add new task types, integrate with third-party tools and libraries, and more. how would we expect someone who is about to write their first hello world plugin to understand what apply conventions means?
