 URL : "https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/70" TITLE : support for relref BODY : thank you for a great package! i'm really enjoying it! it might be related to 40 but is there any chance that the hugo shortcodes ref and/or relref will be supported for .rmd files? following 40, i tried r htmltools::html {{< relref \ ma17q2.en.rmd\ >}} from within ma17q2.en.rmd itself and i got no page found with path or logical name ma17q2.en.rmd while a similar code pointed to a regular markdown file works as expected. i hope this works for rmd files as well.
