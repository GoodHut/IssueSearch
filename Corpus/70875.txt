 URL : "https://github.com/nesbox/tic.computer/issues/220" TITLE : -- buttonlayout: metatag BODY : for specifying how joystic buttons are laid out. proposed values: default - the normal layout it will be assumed for the carts without the tag snes - similar to default, but a/b/x/y are laid out as they are on a snes controller nes - standard nes layout. x/y buttons are smaller and act as start/select respectively. fakenes similar to nes layout but a is before b. this would make it customizable - in some games having a layout with start/select makes more sense than having arrows+abxy.
