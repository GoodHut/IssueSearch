 URL : "https://github.com/opnsense/core/issues/1810" TITLE : tftp transfer fails BODY : hello, tftp transfer fails when going through opnsense. it seems like tftp-helper is missing as initial communication with port 69 succeeds but transfer which uses high ports fails. on freebsd there is tftp-proxy which helps overcome this problem. on opnsense repo haven't seen it there is only ftp-proxy. any help on this please? thanks. regards, kaviraj
