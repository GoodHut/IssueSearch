 URL : "https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues/3873" TITLE : short app passwords BODY : the current app passwords are quite short and only consist of capital letters, which violates all password best practises and policies even the one you can set in nextcloud's password policy app . the login password is likely longer and if generated with a password manager also more secure. so could you at least offer an option for more secure passwords just the way password generators generate them, with all kinds of ascii characters in it ? either for the user or at least for the server admin?
