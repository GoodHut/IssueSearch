 URL : "https://github.com/255BITS/HyperGAN/issues/30" TITLE : errors on import hypergan BODY : it is probably something i did wrong, but i thought i let you know. i just installed hypergan from source using python3 setup.py develop the first error i got when trying import hypergan in a python console was that the hyperchamber module was missing. after installing that one separated this error went away. but now i am stuck with this. it seems like the hypergan.regularizers classes do not get installed properly at least over here : > >>> import hypergan > traceback most recent call last : > file <stdin> , line 1, in <module> > file hypergan/__init__.py , line 2, in <module> > from .gan import gan > file hypergan/gan.py , line 13, in <module> > from hypergan.discriminators import > file hypergan/discriminators/densenet_discriminator.py , line 5, in <module> > import hypergan.regularizers.minibatch_regularizer as minibatch_regularizer > importerror: no module named regularizers.minibatch_regularizer any ideas?
