 URL : "https://github.com/afshinm/juggernaut/issues/8" TITLE : input / output layer BODY : another change we might consider to use in order to clean up the code is creating a specific input layer and output layer as specially cased things within the neural network nn . this also has a nice benefit in that it might make it easier if we try to change in the future to using something besides a vec<samples> for the samples. it would be nice in the future to be able to send data in for training in a more lazy manner rather than have it all batched up at once and having distinct input/output layers could definitely help this. it might be useful to create a builder for the neural network in this case. let test = nnbuilder::new .input 3 .layer 2, sigmoid::new .output 1 .build ; or something of that nature. thoughts?
