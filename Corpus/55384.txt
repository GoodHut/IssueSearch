 URL : "https://github.com/interstateone/JungleGym/issues/2" TITLE : interactive live views BODY : the simulator screen is displayed in junglegym but mouse events aren't sent to the simulator as touch events. fbsimulatorcontrol has support for sending hid events https://github.com/facebook/fbsimulatorcontrol/blob/fbc91286eb6b83b96c3bd9d359b2a6c35c38f019/fbsimulatorcontrol/hid/fbsimulatorhid.h , although it's not clear how pan gestures can be sent, if it's possible at all. simulator.app and xcode playgrounds obviously support this, so it may require changes to fbsimulatorcontrol.
