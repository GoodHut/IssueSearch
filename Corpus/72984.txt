BODY : hi everyone, so i'm having a bit of trouble using axios with vuejs i'm using the quasar framework https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar . i'm making a very simple e-commerce website. i have a button when the user opens the product page that allows the user to insert that product to the cart. <q-btn @click= addtocart > agregar al carrito </q-btn> when the user clicks the button i want to execute the addtocart method: methods: { addtocart { axios.post this.getrooturl + 'app/actions/add_to_cart.php', { product_id: this.$route.params.product_id, quantity: this.quantity, user_id: localstorage.get.item 'user_id' } .then response => { console.log product added... } .catch e => { console.log error... } } } however, i'm facing a problem. it's as if the data gets inserted twice. the first row gets a null user_id and the second row get the correct user_id see image https://ibb.co/krzciw . i'm sure i'm doing something wrong with vuejs or axios because when using postman and sending a request directly to the file, the data only gets inserted once correctly. can anyone help? why is this happening? :/
