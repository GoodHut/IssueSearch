 URL : "https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/emacs-buttercup/issues/85" TITLE : add support for assess BODY : i would like to add support for assess in buttercup. for example, a :buffer property could trigger the use of assess-with-temp-buffers http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/phillip.lord/lentic/assess-doc.html sec-3-4 . i would also like to see spec bodies be encapsulated inside assess-with-preserved-buffer-list . what do you think?
