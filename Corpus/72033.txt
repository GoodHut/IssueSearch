 URL : "https://github.com/MichaCo/CacheManager/issues/184" TITLE : async support suggestion BODY : this is wrt https://github.com/michaco/cachemanager/issues/87 async support. i suggest the usage of valuetask<t> in place of task<t> to support async await so that all synchronous code are covered. and as valuetask<t> is like a superset of task<t> asynchronous code is also covered even though only few libraries are supported. in summary, the methods that can sometimes be asynchronous but mostly synchronous can return valuetask<t> instead of task<t>
