 URL : "https://github.com/libretro/libretro-fceumm/issues/68" TITLE : support for soft-patching BODY : currently, fceumm does not do soft-patching or if it was intended to do so internally, then its not working for some reasons . i tested the patch files in other emu and make sure they are indeed working. a discussion in irc leads that info->need_fullpath = true; should be set to false for retroarch's internal softpatching to do this. setting this value to false does make soft patching work as seen in screenshot: getsu fuuma den japan .nes ! fceumm https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/23315382/23097772/25c3f0f6-f678-11e6-8ee2-a7fa3e8f0141.jpg -other games like wai wai world is also tested to work fine. also using bps and ups patch works. but, it is also said that the core has to recognize this change in value do the proper implementation to make this safe to use. i do not know the technical stuffs behind it but i do hope this will be a feature that will be implemented in the core for a few reason : 1-its a retroachievement compatible core more or less , 2-loads soft patch without crashing atm thanks.
