 URL : "https://github.com/leggitta/PervyCliffNotes/issues/21" TITLE : gender neutral phrases BODY : sasha and i talked about this a little and i think it could get us up and running really soon. we can populate a list of phrases that are neutral to the genders of the characters involved, then we populated the tweet with random characters. they're actually really fun to write mostly butt stuff of course, because everyone has a butt . https://github.com/leggitta/pervycliffnotes/blob/master/csv/phrases.csv please feel free to add your own @cachilders @sashaskinner. right now i'm just storing them in a csv, so we might run into merge conflicts if we all edit at the same time. we might want to have a database of these, that way people could suggest new phrases to incorporate into the bot after we've reviewed them .
