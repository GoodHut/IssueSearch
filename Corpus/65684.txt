 URL : "https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/issues/1276" TITLE : kdb-full fails on macos BODY : describe what you wanted to do execute kdb-full on macos in order to test the jni plugin. describe what you expected after fixing a java-related library bug, i expected kdb-full will work now. describe what actually happened it gave me the following error instead: e251-086:build admin$ kdb-full dyld: library not loaded: @rpath/libelektratools-full.2.dylib referenced from: /usr/local/bin/kdb-full reason: image not found abort trap: 6 apparently, this library gets built successfully, as it is contained in <elektra_build_dir>/lib. but upon installation, it doesn't seem to work. i haven't located the dylib file on the system yet, its at least not in /usr/local/lib/elektra/. as described here https://www.libelektra.org/docgettingstarted/compiling , i also tried setting the build_shared flag to off, but this did not help. after manually setting the dyld path to include the <elektra_build_dir>/lib directory via environment variable, it works successfully. however, this doesn't seem to be an option for production use. anyway heres the command already also includes the java paths for jni plugin : export dyld_fallback_library_path= /users/admin/git/libelektra/build/lib/ and i guess this could be related to 1233 and 1275 ? system information - elektra version: master - macos sierra - almost latest elektra sources
