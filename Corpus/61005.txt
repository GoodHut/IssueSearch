 URL : "https://github.com/mlajtos/moniel/issues/8" TITLE : add support for pytorch BODY : generating executable code is a top priority. pytorch is currently the top dl framework because of the define-by-run nature , so naturally it would be very suiting to combine the two. moniel should provide easy way to define weird architectures and pytorch is cabable of representing them. however, user must be able to interfere with the generated code, because high-level description often does not capture all the neccesities of the idea.
