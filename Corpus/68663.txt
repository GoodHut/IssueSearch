 URL : "https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/15489" TITLE : separating bundle files BODY : i have a service running on background. it sends data to the server in given interval. i am running the service, without running the activity. for service i need a small piece of code to run inside by headless task component, but activity component does a lot of stuff. headless task has nothing to do with activity. when the service has run it takes a lot of memory, so i am thinking on separating the bundle into 2 and load only necessary for the process code. i found out that application js bundle is loaded on application create, but i still have no idea how can i separate the bundle properly. please, suggest me the right way to do it, if possible.
