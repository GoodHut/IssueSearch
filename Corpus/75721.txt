 URL : "https://github.com/cursey/kanan/issues/150" TITLE : i created a button but.. BODY : i created a button to use as a link for the github but i cannot figure out how to direct the link to the button for the life of me. i have the feeling its not in the pack files itself. if anyone can locate the information in regards to redirecting a window popup like mabi does for homepage please let me know. i did not look all that hard however. i may also provide the hud colors as well. but the link is more than just the url file. ! image https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20567846/22032280/c3220cec-dcb1-11e6-8dc0-b541611dde08.png
