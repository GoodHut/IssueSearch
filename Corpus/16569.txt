 URL : "https://github.com/strider2038/json-beautify-it/issues/1" TITLE : json prefix strip BODY : we are using a prefix before sending back the json responses in our api like in the example below: }', { data : wow } note that the above prefix is in fact }', but sometimes the white spaces are stripped out and it's only }', prefixing the json string in this manner is used to help prevent json hijacking. the prefix renders the string syntactically invalid as a script so that it cannot be hijacked. this prefix should be stripped before parsing the string as json. i was wondering if you could extend the service with an update for the above and release it.
