 URL : "https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp/issues/167" TITLE : set single cache dir BODY : i like the idea of caching since i package my jar with 250 mb of associated libraries that change very rarely. however, my jar name does change frequently monthly versioning so i don't particularly want the cache organized by jar. any objections to adding functionality to the loader that would cache everything together in a single folder? i did a quick mod where it can be optionally set through either loader.load or directly through a static method. if not manually set, then the existing cache dir methods are used.
