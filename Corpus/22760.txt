 URL : "https://github.com/DataSF/open-data-explorer/issues/433" TITLE : migrate to netlify BODY : netlify provides really great tools for automating builds against multiple branches with minimal configuration. they also push everything to a cdn automatically, provide ssl out of the box and have lots of useful developer tools. this will save us time and headache troubleshooting build issues that happen between travis and digital ocean and will decrease our risks as netlify patches and maintains secure servers at scale. switching is easy, but to support https, we'll need to add an ssl cert to our metadata api. - configure netlify builds and switch domain to netlify servers - add cert to metadata api and default to https - turn on https on netlify
