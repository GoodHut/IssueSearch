 URL : "https://github.com/mozilla/telemetry-analysis-service/issues/449" TITLE : failed job txp_snoozetabs BODY : a recent run j-48wj0elegkfu failed with: analysisexception: u'path s3://telemetry-parquet/testpilot/txp_snoozetabs/v2/submission_date=20170510 already exists.;' the general gist is that it seems that changes to the atmo scheduling infrastructure to fix flakiness have triggered a second run of the job after it was already run for that day. i'm raising the issue here still to make sure it's known by the owner of the job @sunahsuh.
