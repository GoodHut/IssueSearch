 URL : "https://github.com/venits/react-native-map-clustering/issues/28" TITLE : no onregionchange callback BODY : the original mapview from react-native-maps provides an onregionchange callback, which can be used in the following case: <mapview region={this.state.region} onregionchange={ region => this.setstate { region } } /> without the callback the map is basically locked in place in this case. or is there a way to perhaps access the _original_ mapview object?
