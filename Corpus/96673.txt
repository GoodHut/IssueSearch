 URL : "https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/issues/3071" TITLE : feature request: latestmap BODY : i would love a method to is almost like an .switchmap but the big difference is that it should wait until the latest observable is complete. why? when you are working with an api that isn't cancelable and that specific function can only be executed once and have to wait until the callback is executed before you can executed that function/method again. a use case when you have a player for instance and want to seek to a current time in playback. the player might not have support for multiple seeking at the same time. to write these type of code is very complicated right now.
