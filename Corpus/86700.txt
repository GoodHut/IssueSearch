 URL : "https://github.com/OSSIndex/DevAudit/issues/81" TITLE : implement grafeas support BODY : grafeas is a recently announced standard https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/10/introducing-grafeas-open-source-api-.html for producing and consuming metadata about components in the software supply chain. grafeas defines data types and an api spec that security auditing programs like devaudit can use to fetch data about vulnerabilities in components like operating system and development packages, and to report occurrences of such vulnerabilities in deployed applications and containers. supporting the grafeas spec means that devaudit will be able to interoperate with other security and auditing tools and services. as far as i can tell there are two main aspects of supporting grafeas: 1. use a grafeas-compatible server api as a data source. a grafeas vulnerability scanning provider is roughly analogous to a devaudit datasource, so we already have the basic framework for supporting this. the grafeas api spec is defined in swagger so we need to: 1. generate the c client stubs for the grafeas api using nswag https://github.com/rsuter/nswag 2. fill out the implementation for a grafeas client querying the api for data on supported package managers like nuget, npm, debian epkg et.al 3. implement idatasource for the grapheas data source. 2. report audit results using the grapheas metadata format and publish the results to a graphea server. again the basic framework support is there and all we need to do is implement an auditreporter to do this. so far i haven't been able to generate any code for the grafeas swagger spec so i'm waiting on https://github.com/grafeas/grafeas/issues/63 to continue.
