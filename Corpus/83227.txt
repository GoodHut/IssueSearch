 URL : "https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/issues/1388" TITLE : bv2int overflow problems? BODY : so i've been looking at converting a bitvector object with it's own constraints already , into an integer object. however, there appears to be strangeness with the bv2int method. example: python in 39 : x = bitvec 'x', 3 in 40 : x out 40 : x in 41 : prove x <= 3 proved in 42 : prove bv2int x <= 3 counterexample x = 6 my guess is z3 is allowing overflow in handling of bv2int object, thus 6 would indeed be possible, however undesirable behavior in my case. is there a way to make it honor over/underflows?
