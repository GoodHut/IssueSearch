 URL : "https://github.com/begriffs/postgrest/issues/1031" TITLE : openapi format uuid BODY : if i have a uuid column it appears like rowfilter.test.id : { name : id , required : false, format : uuid , in : query , type : string }, in the spec. however when using with something like swagger ui, i can't enter the uuid with an operator: eq.2e094f21-7a6f-4268-b1ff-c2a376de35ad this will throw an error in swagger ui as intended as it doesn't match the format.
