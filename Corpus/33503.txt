 URL : "https://github.com/jasp-stats/jasp-desktop/issues/2210" TITLE : add set.seed option? BODY : one of the participants of our jasp workshop suggested to add a set.seed option to bayesian analyses which use sampling. i think it would be nice to add this option, but i also remember vaguely that we talked about this before and i cannot recall anymore whether there were good arguments for not including this.
