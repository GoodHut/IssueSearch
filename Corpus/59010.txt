BODY : hi great application and i seemed to make it work on an old machine running lubuntu. at first had some issues with usb.core, but now got the gui up and running. in simulation mode, i can see cycling apps to pick up the data. i can chose the curve for my i-magic, but the trainer is not being detected, probably because the headset is a t1902 version, which is not yet supported. will you be adding that. if you need any support / input from my side, because you do not have the hardware, let me know. thanks, good job
