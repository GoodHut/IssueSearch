 URL : "https://github.com/HearthSim/HSTracker/issues/866" TITLE : warning messages on mac BODY : so im running hs tracker on a mac os sierra. and every time i try to use it... once i start up hs i get the following windows... first... 'hs tracker wants to make changes' i allow this and then again... 'developer tools access is trying to take control of another process' i allow this one too... and then it works fine... but its very annoying to do every time. i end up not using it. been trying to see if there if there is a list in my mac settings to tick or something but found nothing. anyone have any advice? thanks in advance... such a useful program but this stuff is a bummer.
