 URL : "https://github.com/rcaloras/bashhub-client/issues/41" TITLE : feature: expand aliases BODY : could be nice to have an option whether or not to auto expand aliases. to save time i usually put an alias for openstack as o which means my history looks like o server list o stack list and so on... sometimes i'm sloppy and don't setup my aliases everywhere. so then o server list doesn't really mean something. think autoexpanding would make sense as a default but i only gave that thought about 10 sec :-
