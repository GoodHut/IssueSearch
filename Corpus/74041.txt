 URL : "https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/3634" TITLE : documentation of the pki BODY : -------------documentation request -------------------- hey, we had an issue with the pki in the s3 bucket. some kops command or mechanism created new x509 keys some month ago. after restarting our master node some days ago, the master fetched the most recent x509 keys and certs. since the service account signing key was also renewed, all service account tokens were rendered invalid. the current documentation does not describe which component creates the certificates and when this creation is done. i had a glance at the kops code, but i did not find the concrete parts of the code. can you give me any pointers? we want to avoid the recreation if the keys, since it came with some unexpected downtime for our services relaying on the kubernetes api.
