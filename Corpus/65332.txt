BODY : hi, did anyone notice any changes in font rendering quality after upgrading to qt 5.9x, with infinality+ultimate installed? i did, certain fonts among which novarese bq looked significantly watered down on a system with freetype 2.6.5 as well as one with freetype 2.7.1 . upon verification with qt, > opentype cef fonts are now stem-darkening and rendered gamma-corrected which probably explains what i'm seeing. this could simply be a bug in qt or the fonts in question, but could it also be an interaction with the freetype infinality and accompanying fontconfig patches? i did find a fix for qt so let me know if you're concerned by this too.
