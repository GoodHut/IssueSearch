 URL : "https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/issues/333" TITLE : dependency on api-common BODY : is the dependency of proto-google-common-protos on com.google.api:api-common necessary? grpc java depends on proto-google-common-protos for google/rpc/status.proto , and would like to avoid the transitive dependency on com.google.api:api-common . grpc already excludes api-common see https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/pull/2965 due to an issue with auto-value see https://github.com/googleapis/api-common-java/pull/27 . is it possible to get rid of proto-google-common-protos 's dependency on com.google.api:api-common altogether, so we can avoid having to include the exclude rule in our build rules? cc @ejona86
