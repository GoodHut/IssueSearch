 URL : "https://github.com/littleweaver/django-brambling/issues/844" TITLE : new forms ux/behavior BODY : the current custom form situation has a number of existing problems: existing problems - the interface is a little clunky looking - organizers can have anywhere from zero to infinity of each of the four types of forms, but it's not clear why they would want to divide questions into multiple forms - organizers can't delete a custom form once made and they can't submit a form with no questionsâ€”so if an organizer accidentally creates a custom form and they then want to delete it, they are sol solutions i propose these user-story/interface solutions with no assumptions about the backend implementation. i leave that to @melinath and whoever is doing the implementation - each event can only have one of each type of form - editing a form no longer offers the organizer name, form type, or display order - a form can be saved even if it has no questions - there is no distinction from the user perspective between an event not having a custom form and an event having a custom form with no fields - the editing interface looks something like this ! web 1920 1 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/296631/26068651/2f33f4a6-396c-11e7-8e31-f9bff2e45ca5.png upon clicking on a form type the form editing interface could show up to the right of the menu an autosaving interface might make sense in that case or could replace the whole screen as it does now.
