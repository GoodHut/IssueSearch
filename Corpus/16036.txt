 URL : "https://github.com/mlaursen/react-md/issues/640" TITLE : grid full-width ? BODY : description suggestion : it would be great to add a prop to the grid component allowing it to be full-width. currently, the width is determined by its children. but i often wanna create 2-cell grids or 3-cell grids which doesn't change width on cell's content update. my current workaround is to add margin-left 0 and margin-right 0 to the grid style. just a thought. version - react - latest - react-md - latest
