 URL : "https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-java/issues/354" TITLE : how to build? BODY : i'm using intellij, and i'm having a hard time building this project. can you please write instructions how to build it using intellij? including instructions for dummies, for instance what file am i supposed to open and what buttons am i supposed to click. i wanted to start working on a pull request related to reflection based roles, but i couldn't make this project compile. probably some android related sdks aren't installed on my machine, but i'm not sure which installed android studio in order to install the common tooling . thanks, elad
