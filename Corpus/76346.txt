BODY : so i have killed a ton of purple slimes, blue slimes, and even magma slimes... i am currently in a garden of glass map. the mod pack is project ozone lite . now i do not know if this is an issue or not, but i have been trying for days going from various slime islands in the over world, mining dimension, and the nether, along with hitting up nether fortresses . i have yet to get a single slime pearl, with a tinker's sword that has max looting. i even got a sword out of a quest reward chest that has a looting enchantment level of 69 and tried to use that - still no slime pearls. the sword was called epeolatry and it is from the avarita mod avaritia:skullfire_sword . so i guess my question is if this is working as intended, which jei says the slime pearl drops off magma cubes , or if something is wrong here? i did not know if i should report this to you or that mod pack creator. i figured i would start here, since it is your mod and then go over there, if everything is working as it should be. now i should note that i did go into creative mode to spawn in some vanilla slimes, and after like 3 i did get slime pearls. however, i have yet to find any normal slimes as i am in a garden of glass over world basically void and the mining dimension does not really have biomes. so ya :/ thank you for any insight that you might be able to provide.
