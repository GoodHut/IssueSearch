 URL : "https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/issues/1622" TITLE : cleanup dirmanager usage BODY : right now dirmanager seems to be used in two ways: 1. with golem's config directory as root_path it manages subdirs like resources , reference_data , test , etc. 2. with any other subdirectory as root_path it's used to manage some deeper subdirs, like here: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/develop/golem/task/taskmanager.py l87 i think it could be cleaned up to get rid of the second case. possibly with one instance of dirmanager created in client and shared with taskserver and resourceserver. this would also allow to simplify functions like client.get_computed_files_dir, by using dirmanager directly.
