 URL : "https://github.com/yunspace/serverless-golang/issues/37" TITLE : running on localstack BODY : really struggling to run with localstack. trying to use serverless-localstack plugin, but as soon as i drop it into .serverless_plugins make deps and make deploy get stuck forever. running build outside of docker looks fine, trying to deploy it i'm getting unable to find handler script in lambda archive . have absolutely no issues with real aws though. is that the intended way to run on localstack even? any chance to get some first steps explained?
