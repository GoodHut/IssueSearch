 URL : "https://github.com/tibbe/ekg-core/issues/19" TITLE : ghc 8.2.1 warnings BODY : the ghc.stats module seems to have been refactored in ghc 8.2.1, so we now get a bunch of warnings of the following type when compiling system.metrics : system/metrics.hs:414:55: warning: -wdeprecations in the use of ‘bytesallocated’ imported from ghc.stats : deprecated: use rtsstats instead. this will be removed in ghc 8.4.1 | 414 | rts.gc.bytes_allocated , counter . stats.bytesallocated | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ see this gist https://gist.github.com/23skidoo/b3b1c7d3a0e8f140beb28b6b3e46e907 for the full log. looks like we'll have to write a compatibility shim to support future ghc versions.
