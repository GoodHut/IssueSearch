 URL : "https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler/issues/2138" TITLE : use with closure compiler BODY : the output from traceur is not going through closure. namely, it's the use strict prepended to every file. i am essentially using gulp and piping the output from traceur to closure. not sure if this is necessary but a reason to use one and not the other would be great ðŸ˜„ any insight would be greatly appreciated.
