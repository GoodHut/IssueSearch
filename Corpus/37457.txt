 URL : "https://github.com/NexiusTailer/Nex-AC/issues/28" TITLE : many false positives BODY : hi. i use nex-aс on my stage roleplay server with an online 200-300. maybe i incorrectly connected something, but when i first started on the main server, i got a lot of false positives. i configured and made changes the anti-cheat to bring it to a more or less stable state. but until now some false positives are still available and the setting here will not help. i do not want to change the source code much, because it will cause problems with the update. i can constantly provide detailed logs for false positives to help with the correction. it seems to me that the developer of this anticheat is russian and that's why i propose to contact me on вконтакте vk.com/kot_brain . if not, i can create themes here, but it's not very convenient for me.
