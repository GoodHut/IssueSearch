 URL : "https://github.com/sequelize/cli/issues/473" TITLE : classmethods never works BODY : it seems that associate in the following code is never called. it does not even exist in user. javascript var user = sequelize.define 'user', { username: datatypes.string, password: datatypes.string, auth: { type: datatypes.enum, values: 'reader', 'admin', 'root' } }, { classmethods: { associate models { console.log test // pass } } } ; in fact, all the methods defined in classmethods do not appear in user. is that a bug?
