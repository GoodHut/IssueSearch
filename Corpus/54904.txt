 URL : "https://github.com/jonathandturner/rhai/issues/19" TITLE : how to use with no-std BODY : i'm trying out rust on a cheap microcontroller following this tutorial https://polyfractal.com/post/rustl8710/ the tutorial works great and the sample echo program runs over serial. i'd love to add in a rust scripting language and i really like the design of rhai. but when i add the library, the compile fails because of std is missing. info: using existing install for 'nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu' info: override toolchain for '/home/tim/rustl8710/src/rust' set to 'nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu' nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu unchanged - rustc 1.16.0-nightly 4ce7accaa 2017-01-17 cd src/rust && xargo build --target thumbv7m-none-eabi compiling rhai v0.4.0 error e0463 : can't find crate for std | = note: the thumbv7m-none-eabi target may not be installed i'm fairly new to rust still and am not quite clear on what this all means. is rhai meant to be used in such embedded use cases? it sure would be neat if it or something like it did work.
