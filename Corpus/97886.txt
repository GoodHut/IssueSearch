BODY : running the following init_printing use_latex='mathjax' y=symbol 'y',positive=true x=symbol 'x',positive=true z=symbol 'z',positive=true r10= 2 z 1.5 exp -z x r21=3 -.5 z/2 1.5 z x exp -z x/2 simplify integrate simplify x 3 r10 r21 , x,0,y yields: polynomialdivisionfailed: couldn't reduce degree in a polynomial division algorithm when dividing 0.816496580927726 z 4.0 , 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 by 12.0/12.0 . this can happen when it's not possible to detect zero in the coefficient domain. the domain of computation is rr z 4.0,z . zero detection is guaranteed in this coefficient domain. this may indicate a bug in sympy or the domain is user defined and doesn't implement zero detection properly. but if i try doing the integration without the constant factors except for z it works fine: simplify integrate z 4 x 4 exp -3/2 z x , x,0,y
