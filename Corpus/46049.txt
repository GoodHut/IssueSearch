 URL : "https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/2379" TITLE : lambda plugin headers BODY : hey guys, great work on kong! i have been evaluating the lambda plugin for kong. during my testing i've found that none of the headers get passed over from kong. i would have thought that any headers from the original request would be forwarded to lambda through the event? this seems to work for post data, but not headers : this would be particularly useful we so can extract the auth headers and http method 👍
