 URL : "https://github.com/JuliaApproximation/ApproxFun.jl/issues/506" TITLE : fast hermits transform? BODY : i note that your hermite transform uses gausshermite quadrature. while this is clearly a reliable choice, is there any scope for implementing an n logn method as described in https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2630232/ !po=88.5000 ? for band limited functions there is a factorization using recursion relation, akin to fft vs basic fft. i don't know it well enough to know how practical it is to implement. maybe this would sit better in fasttransforms.jl ?
