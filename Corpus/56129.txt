 URL : "https://github.com/APSIMInitiative/ApsimX/issues/1783" TITLE : met file path problems BODY : when choosing met data, the ui often gets the path mixed up. the file name seems to stay right, but it often changes the given path to that of the apsim executable ie the directory into which apsim was installed . it doesn't seem to do this all of the time. but enough to make batch tasks difficult - the model fails to find met data from time to time.
