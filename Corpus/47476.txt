 URL : "https://github.com/laradock/laradock/issues/797" TITLE : php-fpm tokenizer arg BODY : when installing, the following warning is displayed. warning: tokenizer tokenizer.so is already loaded! we're trying to install tokenizer, which is included and enabled within php by default https://secure.php.net/manual/en/tokenizer.installation.php . i do understand that it's possible to add a switch for it, however to uninstall the extension, we would need to use something like docker-php-ext-disable as described in docker-library/php 220. as that feature is still in development, i think it's only fair to ask if we actually need the switch to uninstall tokenizer.
