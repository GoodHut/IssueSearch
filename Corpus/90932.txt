 URL : "https://github.com/teq/serialazy/issues/2" TITLE : support class inheritance BODY : child class should inherit all property+serializer pairs from a parent class. child property+serializer pairs should be able to shadow parent ones if they use the same name serializer should be tied to property of a class where it was defined, but not to properties with the same name of clild/parent classes. e.g., b extends a , a.x has a serializer, b has its own x without serializer. in this case b.x should shadow a.x and erase its serializer.
