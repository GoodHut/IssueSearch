 URL : "https://github.com/concur/skipper/issues/13" TITLE : invalid response code BODY : when adding a deployment for the first time, validation errors may present as a 404 instead of as a 422 . the issue here is that the k8s api also returns a 422 on create when the object exists already. as a result the calls here should be updated to try to retrieve the object first and then decide if it is an update or a create call. https://github.com/concur/skipper/blob/master/api/controllers/deploy/k8scrud.js l160
