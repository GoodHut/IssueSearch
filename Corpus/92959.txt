 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/sqlopsstudio/issues/200" TITLE : add a built in import tool BODY : - sql operations studio version: 0.23.6 steps to reproduce: 1. try to load data from a csv or excel file to a table. 2. notice the lack of an option to do so. it would be very good if there was some built-in tool that could import external files to into a table... a trimmed down version of the sql server import and export wizard that supports csv or excel files would be nice.
