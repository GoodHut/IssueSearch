 URL : "https://github.com/limonte/sweetalert2/issues/434" TITLE : broken css since v6.3.4 BODY : since v6.3.4 the layout is broken when the alert is opened. i found out that the class swal2-in and style= padding-right: 19px on the body element are responsible for this problem. my app makes heavy use of flex containers. when swal is open, the body grows infinitely in height and a scroll bar appears. when i remove the two, everything is centered fine and the background looks like supposed. in v6.3.3 everything is also working properly. at the moment i have no time to find out what exactly you have to do to recreate the issue.
