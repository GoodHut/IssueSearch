 URL : "https://github.com/originell/jpype/issues/274" TITLE : java 8 lambdas do not work BODY : okay an interesting flaw was found when we tried to return functions that gave biconsumer<> instances. if we produced an anonymous instance it worked properly, but if we returned a lambda the resulting python class produced an error. unfortunately the test bench is currently expected to compile with 1.7 so i can't yet produce tests that should the issue. i will try to revise the tests to move to 1.8. once that is complete i can demonstrate the problem which should lead to a pull with a correction.
