BODY : hi, so ok dnvm is now broken , the instructions fail at the point of installing it. but it's still on github. would you be so kind as to fix this either with the archived dnvm or without dnvm? i'm trying to get the most out of this without abandoning it entirely, using the instructions for core, or the asp.net and docker demo that you put together. it's a shame to see good code broken, i'm sure this is a widespread problem. why did you need to use dnvm and can you accomplish the goal of this project without it? thanks very much
