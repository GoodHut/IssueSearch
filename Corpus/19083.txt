 URL : "https://github.com/krakenjs/swaggerize-express/issues/125" TITLE : wildcards in path BODY : i have a service with an entrypoint like app.get '/forwardthis. that takes anything after /forwardthis and pipes it to another url. for example /forwardthis/chat/place1 and /forwardthis/data/abc is received by the same endpoint and then whatever is sent in is forwarded to myurl.com, like myurl.com/chat/place1 and myurl.com/data/abc. problem is i can not create a file named forwardthis. to have a filepath matching a route like that. how would i go about accomplishing this with swaggerize-express?
