 URL : "https://github.com/RedHatSatellite/katello-cvmanager/issues/40" TITLE : useless parsing of tasks BODY : hi, given the code, if the latest job is found with no new packages is found, then if checkrepos is on all of the tasks are parsed up to find out a task that match the channel that we need for. we are here at the code https://github.com/redhatsatellite/katello-cvmanager/blob/64778cff97c5bb023816624787cd920f5759acea/cvmanager l386 when one repository is found, further check are done https://github.com/redhatsatellite/katello-cvmanager/blob/64778cff97c5bb023816624787cd920f5759acea/cvmanager l413 a deeper check start https://github.com/redhatsatellite/katello-cvmanager/blob/64778cff97c5bb023816624787cd920f5759acea/cvmanager l200 when the task is from the past, the code is just skipping this task https://github.com/redhatsatellite/katello-cvmanager/blob/64778cff97c5bb023816624787cd920f5759acea/cvmanager l205 wondering if in this section of code, if the task is from the paste, we can skip the remaining tasks. https://github.com/redhatsatellite/katello-cvmanager/blob/64778cff97c5bb023816624787cd920f5759acea/cvmanager l415 looking at the code , my understanding is that if a past task is found, since the tasks are sorted by ended_at, we can be sure that no other tasks will be found afterwards with packages that are missing. any comment?
