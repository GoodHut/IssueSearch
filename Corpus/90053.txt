 URL : "https://github.com/NRGI/resourcedata.org/issues/52" TITLE : rgi dataset naming issues BODY : based on a suspicion that there are duplicate names, and also because some datasets don't generate a sensible name at all e.g., one dash , i'm adding random characters to names. but this is not ideal as it breaks updates. not super urgent, but need to investigate naming at source and see where these difficult names are coming from. n.b. name is ckan speak for a readable id, i.e. the part in the url.
