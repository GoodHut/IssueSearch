 URL : "https://github.com/codingwell/scala-guice/issues/61" TITLE : create named actors BODY : we need another provideactorref that provides named actors. named actors at least at my experience level are essential to connecting distributed systems. guiceactorproducer's magic is too deep for me to see how to create the needed changes. it seems that probable only an additional argument passed into indirectactorproducer would do it. thanks, this wrapper is really needed. i only wish i could have made more use of it.
