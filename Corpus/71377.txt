 URL : "https://github.com/google/guava/issues/2851" TITLE : add equivalence relation BODY : when we have some a reflexive symmetric transitive relation between two instances of one class then an equivalence relation is a helpful assistant for check that this relation was accounted in code earlier. for example we processed a relation between two people p1, p2 and we don't want to process relation p2,p1 because it is th same. we put p1, p2 to a set and when we invoke 'contains' method for p2, p1 on the set we will get true. more about equivalence relation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/equivalence_relation example of implementation https://github.com/ivan-osipov/guava/commit/007e471f459085edea9a04a13e08c40af4659911
