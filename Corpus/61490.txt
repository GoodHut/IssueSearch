 URL : "https://github.com/cul-it/cugir-geoblacklight/issues/170" TITLE : automatic raster styles BODY : ideally, each raster dataset should be assigned a custom style that maps the min/max values of the dataset to specific colors or black/white . theoretically, this could be done by cugirpaws, calculating the min/max values, then generating an .sld file and saving it to the server, then creating a geoserver style for that .sld file, then assigning it to the geoserver layer record. this could take some time to develop properly, so for the initial launch, we can just use the geoserver admin website to manually create a style for each layer.
