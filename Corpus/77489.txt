 URL : "https://github.com/Putaitu/hashbrown-cms/issues/205" TITLE : new connection structure BODY : the new structure will allow for more flexibility. instead of a simple type , it will consist of a processingtype , which could be jekyll or json, and a deploymenttype , which could be git, api, ssh, sftp, ftp etc. the existing type parameter could serve as a preset instead for backward compatibility.
