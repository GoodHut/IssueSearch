 URL : "https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/4315" TITLE : implement exports literal BODY : in cases where public apis of targets guarantee the need for some other target, it is sometimes helpful/necessary to be able to export a dependency to consuming targets. implement exports literal in pants to be able to specify which of a target's dependencies will be exported so the consumers would not need to specify/know about these. an example of this usage would be: java_library name='a', dependencies= 'src/java/dep/it:needs', exports= 'src/java/dep/it:needs',
