 URL : "https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/1984" TITLE : docker can't read logs BODY : expected behavior be able to read docker logs, despite any error messages. docker events command should work or display some human-readable error actual behavior when docker container is not stopped gracefully ie computer is shut down while containers running , logs become corrupt and can no longer be read. error message: error from daemon in stream: error grabbing logs: invalid character '\x00' looking for beginning of value seems to be related to: https://forums.docker.com/t/docker-daemon-error-invalid-character-x00-looking-for-beginning-of-value/18072/4 the command docker events will run forever without exiting or outputting anything. my workaround so far has been to use remove all data feature under reset in preferences, but its frustrating to reinstall all containers whenever i forget to stop containers or computer auto-updates. information docker for mac: version: 17.06.0-ce-mac19 4cdec4294a50b2233146b09469b49937dabdebdd macos: version 10.12.6 build: 16g29 logs: /tmp/a2c0de10-7188-4a98-93d8-9ead1a849527/20170822-104841.tar.gz ok db.git ok vmnetd ok dns ok driver.amd64-linux ok virtualization vt-x ok app ok moby ok system ok moby-syslog ok db ok env ok virtualization kern.hv_support ok slirp ok osxfs ok moby-console ok logs ok docker-cli ok menubar ok disk steps to reproduce the behavior 1. run containers 2. shut down computer w/o stopping them 3. start up and run containers 4. attempt to access logs
