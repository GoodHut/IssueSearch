 URL : "https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/9306" TITLE : additional botr chapters BODY : is it possible for the additional botr chapters to be made available? there are a few additional docs that are tantalising mentioned in ceemain.cpp https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/1d03b8fd8d650bd215623a7b035e68db96697e59/src/vm/ceemain.cpp l40-l127 , only some of which appear to match up with what's already available on github. although i guess that several don't apply to coreclr, 'clickonce activation' for instance? issue opened as suggested by https://twitter.com/ziki_cz/status/826588632064471040 @karelz | mention in cemain.cpp | publish botr doc | |-----------------------|------------------| | introduction/botr introduction.docx | documentation/botr/botr-faq.md https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/documentation/botr/botr-faq.md | | jit/jit design.doc | documentation/botr/ryujit-overview.md https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/documentation/botr/ryujit-overview.md | | ngen/ngendesign.doc | | | mscorlib/mscorlibdesign.doc | documentation/botr/mscorlib.md https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/documentation/botr/mscorlib.md | | managedeh/design.doc | | | cer/cerdesign.doc | | | assemblyloader/assemblyloader.doc | | | assemblyloader/fusiondesign.doc | | | bcl/systemstringdesign.doc | | | diagnosticservices/profilingapidesign.doc | documentation/botr/profiling.md https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/documentation/botr/profiling.md | | eeremotingsupport/remotingdesign.doc | | | mda/mdadesign.doc | | | reflection/reflectiondesign.doc | | | runtimesecurity/runtimesecuritydesign.doc | | | loadtimesecurity/declarativesecurity-design.doc | | | loadtimesecurity/strongname.doc | | | runtimesecurity/clickonce activation.doc | | | runtimesecurity/cryptography.doc | | | runtimesecurity/demandevaldesign.doc | |
