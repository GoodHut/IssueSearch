 URL : "https://github.com/drone/drone/issues/2042" TITLE : add visibility field BODY : i would like to add a new attribute to the repository called visibility. this will give us more control over which repositories are visible to users and under which circumstances. this idea is inspired by gitlab. the visibility field will have the following values: - public visible by anyone - private visible by anyone with access - internal visible by any authenticated user the visibility field will have the following default value: - public if repository is public - private if repository is private the use case for this is that some organizations are running github in private mode meaning the repository is private but don't want users to have to login to see the build results. this will replace the undocumented public_mode hack that we added a while back.
