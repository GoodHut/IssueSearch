 URL : "https://github.com/thegazelle-ad/gazelle-server/issues/122" TITLE : add a 500 error page BODY : right now it just says 502, we should have a simple index.html that caddy serves when it can't connect to the backend that just says that something went wrong. we should also throw up a can't connect to server error when loading a new page fromthe front end. right now the loading bar just gets stuck.
