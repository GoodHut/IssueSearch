BODY : hello all, i just wanted to give a heads up... in a slightly diverse sample, i'm finding some significant race effects. the effect isn't that large beta=0.249; non-white having older brains , but i'm presuming a high er of the subs in the classifier are white so that can be important to consider when running different analyses, etc. . cheers, jamie.
