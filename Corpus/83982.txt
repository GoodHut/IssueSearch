 URL : "https://github.com/volCommunity/vol-crawlers/issues/7" TITLE : consider using deltafetch BODY : this looks interesting to speed things up, have not looked at it closely, hope it looks at more than the url ; > this is a scrapy spider middleware to ignore requests to pages containing items seen in previous crawls of the same spider, thus producing a delta crawl containing only new items. > this also speeds up the crawl, by reducing the number of requests that need to be crawled, and processed typically, item requests are the most cpu intensive . https://github.com/scrapy-plugins/scrapy-deltafetch
