 URL : "https://github.com/CGATOxford/CGATPipelines/issues/289" TITLE : database in mapping report BODY : the location of the database for pipelines is set by database_name in the ini. however, by default cgatreport looks for the database name in report_sql_backend . some pipelines bypass this by passing backend=params database_name to the trackersql constructor in their pipeline specific subclassing of trackersql . i don't know if cgatreport should look for database_name for report trackers should pass database_name , but one of these should happen else the report can't find the database unless it is called csvdb and is in the current directory.
