 URL : "https://github.com/oldjunyi/NoMobSpawningOnTrees/issues/7" TITLE : mob rule: zombie pigman BODY : not sure if this is a bug, or if i've lost the plot. i've tried various rules along the lines of mob:zombiepigman , mob:entityzombiepigman , mob:minecraft.zombie_pigman , but none of these have worked. every time i get an error that states can not find this mob . so, how do i go about setting a rule related to zombie pigmen?
