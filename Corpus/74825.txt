 URL : "https://github.com/ottconnect/Legion/issues/221" TITLE : fishing & frst aid issue BODY : players can cast their hook into the water, but the bobber that floats that one should be able to click on to reel in the catch isnt clickable and doesnt jump. players arent able to catch fish presently making this a dead profession. also the first aid profession appears to have been completely severed from the skill trainers, most dont even open a gossip window to show list of available items available. im aware of the npc database issue being investigated
