 URL : "https://github.com/zkat/make-fetch-happen/issues/21" TITLE : notify on retries BODY : we already inform users about how many retries it took to complete a request. it might be nice to accept a callback for synchronous notifications whenever a retry happens, so users can be modified. this should not expose any internal datastructures or allow any changes to the retry logic. if users want to control retry, they should use existing settings. errors from the callback should also be called and thrown away silently, i think.
