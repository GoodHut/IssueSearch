 URL : "https://github.com/davidemms/OrthoFinder/issues/78" TITLE : ogs badly aligned BODY : hi! i really enjoy using orthofinder, but i think i need some help. i analyzed 10 species from the same genus and with genes from the same domain. i am interested in orthogroups where all species are present 25 . i retrieved some of the 25 ogs and aligned them with muscle and got 20 % -30 % pairwise alignment. the minimum i need is 50 %. i think i would have to change the blast e valuebto e-10 or adjust mcl somehow. do you have an idea how this can be done? thank you
