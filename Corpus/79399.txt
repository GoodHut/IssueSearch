BODY : hi, i wanted to participate on the ico sales for the status and civic projects. but both didn't work. i tried to send my eth with the ethereum wallet and with the ethereum mist clients, using geth 1.6.5. but it got rejected both times, also consuming 0,1eth for the status transfer. before i put my passwort for confirmation in it set the max gas to 250.000 as claimed. but after i sent the transactions it was automaticlly set to about 186.000. was that right?, or is there another menu where i can ajust my maximum gas to be send. i've seen that you can ajust the gasprice for every transaction if you are using myether wallet , but i don't want to deposit my eth online and until now every normal transaction with an coinexchange site worked.
