 URL : "https://github.com/MLG-Fortress/ExtraHardMode/issues/77" TITLE : suggestion zombie run BODY : i played on a server a while ago, i think it was some sort of zombie apocalypse type thing. the zombies could run after you i think that would be a great feature to add to this plugin. i would also suggest that have it configurable as to which level they can run example, only above sea level i think having them chase you in caves would be too crazy but if it was configurable ... the server admin has all the choice how they want their zombies to work. i am loving this plugin on my server, i just feel that would add a little more difficulty
