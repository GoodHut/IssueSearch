 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18083" TITLE : how do i compile vscode? BODY : i've cloned the source. i've run scripts/npm install. i've run npm run watch. i've tried gulp vscode-win32. these all build the typescript stuff, but nothing builds the executable. i can't find any information on this, because everytime i google how to compile vscode or anything similar, i find hundreds of articles about how to compile stuff in vscode . the documentation here: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/how-to-contribute is extremely lacking. i've done everything it says and have not gotten anything built.
