 URL : "https://github.com/ZeroNetJS/zeronet-js/issues/50" TITLE : faster page load times BODY : at the moment at every click: load wrapper -> wrapper creates iframe and loads page html -> init websocket connection -> load page details using websocket api it could be much faster by sharing the wrapper and the websocket connection between and only change the inner frame html. need a wrapper api command that allows change the url of the page.
