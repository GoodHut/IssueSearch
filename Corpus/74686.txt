 URL : "https://github.com/Gargron/mastodon/issues/392" TITLE : feature report toot/user BODY : as it stands now, users on mastodon instances have to externally contact the site admin to e.g. silence abusive users or spammers on the public timeline. a report function on toots and account profiles could help with this, as well as help with prioritizing issues by e.g. displaying a list of reported toots on the admin back-end, grouped by users and sorted by total number of reports . detailed features that would be useful here: - users should be able to send reports anonymously, so that e.g. users worried about an abusive account can raise this without concerns about repercussions if, say, a reported account happens to be a friend of the server admin . - possibly have a default-off tickbox for the reporter to signify they are fine with being contacted about the issue by the server admin so that e.g. a user could privately call for help if they're in distress but don't know where else to turn this would also lay a foundation for more advanced moderation functionality, e.g. allowing a list of community moderators that can examine reports and silence spammers or hide specific toots without requiring site admin access, or categorised reports so that e.g. reports of users in distress can be prioritized over spammers.
