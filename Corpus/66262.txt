 URL : "https://github.com/SaskArtists/SaskArtists/issues/197" TITLE : michael bromley gallery BODY : the gallery on michael bromley's page does not necessarily fit the page. it is possible for a given picture to be taller than expected, preventing the caption from being visible on all images. this problem is compounded by the format of the page, as it limits the view to four different windows and blocks the caption if it exceeds the bounds.
