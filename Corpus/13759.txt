 URL : "https://github.com/spacedogXYZ/us_zipcodes_congress/issues/1" TITLE : zip code overlap BODY : how are you representing zcta that map to more than one cd in this file? when you say you de-dupe the data, does that mean that you remove zctas that span cds removing those zcta entirely or just choose one? i've been considering a/b testing a zip code lookup option and then falling back on full address if there is not an exact match for visitthem.org. we currently always ask for full address and then do the lookup via polygon.
