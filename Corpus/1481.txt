 URL : "https://github.com/talandar/ProgressiveDifficulty/issues/5" TITLE : 1.12.2 crash BODY : given the behaviour i'm seeing it's probably a mod conflict, but i'm not seeing anything useful in the logs, it crashes directly after buffing a different and usually vanilla mob each time, here's the crash https://hastebin.com/urecixarez and fml-latest part 1 https://paste.ee/p/pgrde and part 2 https://paste.ee/p/ia5zh logs. other than keep swapping mods in and out until something changes , is there anything smarter i can do on my end to provide better data?
