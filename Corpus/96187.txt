 URL : "https://github.com/cuny-academic-commons/commons-in-a-box/issues/128" TITLE : enabling multisite on cbox BODY : one of our colleagues -- maybe chris stein? -- installed cbox recently and noted that it is a bit complicated to do a multisite install. he said that the wp multisite instructions tell you to install all plugins, which is problematic for cbox, and that perhaps we should include a warning in cbox that if people want a multisite cbox, they should enable multisite before installing cbox.
