 URL : "https://github.com/othree/javascript-libraries-syntax.vim/issues/68" TITLE : no typescript support BODY : i don't have typescript support. first i figured out that the filetype was not set to typescript. vim told me after :set ft? that the filetype is xml filetype=xml so i have set it manually with autocmd buffnewfile,buffread .ts set filetype=typescript but it didn't solve the problem. a workaround would be to set the filetype to javascript, but i would rather use your specific syntax file. :
