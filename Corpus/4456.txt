 URL : "https://github.com/MartinLoeper/KAMP-DSL/issues/43" TITLE : create a build BODY : there is an example how to build binaries: https://eclipse.org/xtext/documentation/350_continuous_integration.html. this would be awesome because enduser would not have to install all xtext development sdks and stuff. i suggest a travis job for master which deploys to github pages. github pages will then act as update site for the enduser to install the kamprulelanguage feature.
