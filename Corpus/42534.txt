 URL : "https://github.com/seandepagnier/weather_routing_pi/issues/101" TITLE : boat, polar stats tab BODY : in the stats tab when the wind value is out of the range of the highlighted polar file, there is an indication of nan ind which does not mean much to users. looks like an error. perhaps there should be wind range checking done on the selected polar? so the user cannot go beyond the range or something? i am sure there are other issues like what the wind step is too. ! screenshot 105 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2363959/34240936-cec40086-e5df-11e7-8fe0-c52528bc4377.png
