 URL : "https://github.com/standardnotes/web/issues/112" TITLE : cannot log in BODY : i used the android app to register my email address and enter some notes. then i tried to use the web app to access these notes, but i was unable to log in. i have a pound sign Â£ in my password, and think that it is this that is causing the problem. i've logged out of my android app, and then back in, successfully - so it's not that i don't know what my password is. i also registered a second email address using no special characters in the password. with this, i was able to access the related notes from both the android app and the web app.
