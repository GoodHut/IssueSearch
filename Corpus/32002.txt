 URL : "https://github.com/nikolaswise/web-design-workshop/issues/76" TITLE : the younger scrolls BODY : http://www.rleonardi.com/interactive-resume/ url i haven't been paying attention to cutting-edge websites for very long so this site may not be entirely unique but it blew me away. the entire concept is so fun and inviting and it _insists_ that you scroll through to the end. i mean, you can't _not_ beat the level, right? the way that the elements respond to the character's proximity is timed so well, and everything is so beautifully constructed that the viewer is encouraged to understand the graphs and information. my only criticism is that if you had visited this website previously, closed it, then decided that you wanted to contact robby leonardi, you would have to scroll _all the way through_ again.
