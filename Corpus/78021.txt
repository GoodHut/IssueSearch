 URL : "https://github.com/deeplearning4j/nd4j/issues/1689" TITLE : parallel run gpu devices BODY : i have a multi-gpu system and i want to run same program example code dl4j-examples/dl4j-cuda-specific-examples/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/examples/multigpu/multigpulenetmnistexample.java in different gpus without interacting each other. initially when i run it, it uses all 3 gpus ! all_3 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12293116/23698268/4bdf16d0-042e-11e7-9349-b7ff8f98a345.png then to specify exact device, i use the code: nd4j.getaffinitymanager .attachthreadtodevice threadid, 1 ; to use only the 2nd gpu now the usage is; ! device_1 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12293116/23698336/8d5cab86-042e-11e7-917e-2fffb34580be.png but the problem is, still ndj4 creates 3 process and use only 1. therefore when i run the program second time when gpu-1 is in use i get the error can't create new cublas handle! is there are way to release the other two gpus?
