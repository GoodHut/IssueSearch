 URL : "https://github.com/narc0tiq/factorio-updater/issues/35" TITLE : unit tests, pls BODY : it's really not nice to have a complete lack of tests, even if it is unclear what _can_ be tested. at the very least, an issue like 11 could be automatically checked for possible regression\ . --- \ - i hesitate to say it wouldn't have happened, since i probably wouldn't have expected a split upgrade path until one actually presented itself, but now we know it can exist and we should make sure we continue supporting it.
