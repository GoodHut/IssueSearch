 URL : "https://github.com/0xProject/website/issues/39" TITLE : display usd prices BODY : issue : most trades on 0x otc will be going in/out of eth tokens so we can relatively easily display prices for these trading pairs as x/eth . it becomes less clear how to display prices for less common trading pairs, for example, for rep <-> mln' do we display price as rep/mln or mln/rep ? this price information isn't meaningful. proposed solution credit to @phabc on 0x slack : display each token price in usd. pull this data from coinmarketcap or a similar api. example : selling : 20 mln @ $38.48 receiving : 48.31 rep @ $15.93
