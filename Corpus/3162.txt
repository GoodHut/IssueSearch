 URL : "https://github.com/clarkj93/Automatic-Review-Console/issues/26" TITLE : limit is good BODY : i like the limit but i would suggest why not get 10 or more at a time and just iterate through those 10 records, it means only one visit to the database, maybe do some tests to see whether this improves speed and whether getting 100 may also benefit as well. https://github.com/clarkj93/automatic-review-console/blob/36a6f83bfd220a434b351bd3c88ce9ed3dcf4a9b/automatic%20review/reviewtools.cs l37
