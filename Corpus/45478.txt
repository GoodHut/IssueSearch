 URL : "https://github.com/Vdauphin/HeartsAndMinds/issues/327" TITLE : ied explosion effects BODY : 326 alias released his blast effect script pack. looks interesting to test out. located here : http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=32567 url in the script, you can select radius of blast like between 15-20m. if set too large, then it would damage would be far too extensive. it can be set for whatever small or large. it does spawn a crater object so i would leave that out and the air drop part and just include the only parts needed the particle, animation and sound effects for ied explosions. might be something worth exploring. i'll conduct a few test trials and report back.
