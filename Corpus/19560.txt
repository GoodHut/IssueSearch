 URL : "https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/1215" TITLE : add instance norm? BODY : hello, what about adding instancenorm2d layer to the core? it is used in stylization and found its place in gans. will it be ok if it is implemented using batchnorm2d as in torch code https://github.com/dmitryulyanov/texture_nets/blob/master/instancenormalization.lua ? barchnorm2d can be avoided though. found this implementation by @darkstar112358 here https://github.com/darkstar112358/fast-neural-style/blob/master/neural_style/transformer_net.py l111 , which does not use batchnorm. which one do you prefer? i would be able to make a pr then.
