 URL : "https://github.com/morkt/GARbro/issues/68" TITLE : other .npk title support? BODY : hello there! i stumbled across this awesome program just a little while ago, and i'm so glad and thankful that it's a gui. a lot of visual novel archive tools are all command line, so it's really nice to see some forays into the gui direction. anywho, a lot of the visual novels that i'm looking at are different to the usual eroge's, and i was wondering if it's possible to add support for another nitro+ title, the new windows 10 re-release of togainu no chi. it is a nitro+chiral title, but it's using the same encryption style as sonicomi and tokyonecro. just obviously a different title... . i had a gander at the source for the garbro, and didn't see any immediate way to add support for extra games ourselves very easily and i am having a dilly of a time trying to locate the extra api/dll files for references in the solution , so i figured i'd ask. thank you very much for your consideration! also, if you need the script.npk file for testing, am i allowed to attach it here or should i send it somewhere?
