 URL : "https://github.com/KVSun/kvsun.com/issues/90" TITLE : php 5.6 & 7 compatibility BODY : there are a few issues that have come up due to being developed using php 7 but the server is running php 5.6 the most critical of these at the moment is parsing encrypted text in \shgysk8zer0\phpcrypt\traits\aes::decrypt due to list working in opposite directions. there is also the problem of typehinting for string , int , and in return values, which affects \shgysk8zer0\authorize . not sure if i should go through the hassle of transferring to a new server, fix the php 5.6 bugs, or upgrade the existing server and deal with all that could go wrong with that .
