 URL : "https://github.com/ZipCPU/tttt/issues/2" TITLE : missing call to gb_new ? BODY : i see you have defined a function gb_new , which mallocs a new board. this function does not appear to be called anywhere in the version i cloned. strangely, it somehow still works. should main or play_game create the board before resetting it with gb_new ? it seems like we should be able to just s/gb_new/gb_reset/ and it should work without further changes. the reason i'm asking is, my computer does not have an mmu, and if you're relying on mmu behavior in some capacity to auto-initialize or auto-allocate the structure, it will crash spectacularly on my kestrel hardware. :
