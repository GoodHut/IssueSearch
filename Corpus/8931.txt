 URL : "https://github.com/dlrudie/Snip/issues/219" TITLE : snips won't run BODY : i just downloaded and extracted the files as said, i already have 7zip so it did it automatically. when i try to execute the application it won't run, the thinking wheel goes, but other that that nothing. i even see it trying to run in the processes just to give up the ghost a few second after i try to run it.
