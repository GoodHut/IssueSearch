 URL : "https://github.com/jdolan/quetoo/issues/380" TITLE : color appears to be broken BODY : any color string green/blue is no longer recognized and shows a red blaster trail. default still gives yellow, and then if you set it to 111111 you get a purple trail... not sure if this is a real issue, or if the cvar docs are just out of date and everyone has old binds...
