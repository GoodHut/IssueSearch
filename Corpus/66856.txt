 URL : "https://github.com/googleads/google-api-ads-ruby/issues/139" TITLE : nomethoderror : for nil BODY : this method https://github.com/googleads/google-api-ads-ruby/blob/master/ads_common/lib/ads_common/auth/oauth2_handler.rb l78-l82 triggers a nomethoderror when an authorization is failing. presumably get_token is returning nil and there's no guard. ruby def auth_string credentials token = get_token credentials return ::signet::oauth2.generate_bearer_authorization_header token :access_token end it would be useful if a more specific exception were raised so it could be handled appropriately i.e., flagging an authorization as invalid and notifying the user, rather than showing a 500 page over with no context .
