 URL : "https://github.com/FABtotum/fabui-colibri/issues/45" TITLE : no bed calibration BODY : with actual fabui 0.99.20170301.1711 when choosing bed calibration, the introduction screen is shown, hitting the start button is rewarded with two faint high pitch beeps, nothing moves at all, esp. the bed does not, the head doesn't home and the probe isn't switched out. but after a while one is rewarded with a 100% level bed. this behavior doesn't change after reboot or reset.
