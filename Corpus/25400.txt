 URL : "https://github.com/syndesisio/syndesis-ui/issues/1103" TITLE : yarn warning on ci BODY : when we move to yarn 1.2.1 current latest we'll see this on the ci warning you are using node 7.9.0 which is not supported and may encounter bugs or unexpected behavior. yarn supports the following semver range: ^4.8.0 || ^5.7.0 || ^6.2.2 || ^8.0.0 we can probably move to node 8.x for the build, at least it's working for me here locally.
