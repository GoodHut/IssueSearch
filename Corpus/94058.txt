 URL : "https://github.com/cubecart/v6/issues/1776" TITLE : better testing xml content BODY : in language->clonemodulelanguage , php's simplexml_load_file could return a false or something that looks like false. suggest: if file_exists $from && !file_exists $to && $content = simplexml_load_file $from !== false { if !isset $content->group && !isset $content->group 0 ->attributes ->name return false; so, additionally, if making an object from the file fails, don't do anything. if a group does not exist, then it matters not if a string node exists. testing for a string is probably not what we want to verify anyway. the file is out of compliance with the expected schema. if group does exist, then we can make the next test to see if there is a name. otherwise, $content->group 0 is null and calling attributes on null returns a fatal error. might want to wrap this in a try/catch block. also, it seems to me that only group 0 is processed. that might comply with language version 1.0 translation node, but not with language version 2.0 translation node.
