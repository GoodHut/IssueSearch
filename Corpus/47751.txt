 URL : "https://github.com/iLyaTkachev/Sprint01/issues/3" TITLE : property _ivars usage BODY : in appdelegate , viewcontroller and other classes where you use properties do not access _ivars directly - do that only through full property access with dot notation or as a method invocation . objective-c _mytitlelabel= uilabel alloc initwithframe:cgrectmake 100.0f, 0.0f, 200.0f, 25.0f ; _mysubtitlelabel= uilabel alloc initwithframe:cgrectmake 100.0f, 25.0f, 200.0f, 25.0f ; _myimageview= uiimageview alloc initwithframe:cgrectmake 25.0f,1.0f, 48.0f, 48.0f ; there is also leak in the code above. review your code again for the same pieces of code and fix them.
