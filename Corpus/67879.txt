 URL : "https://github.com/codevcode/compose-with-scope/issues/1" TITLE : questions & suggestions BODY : what's the difference between consumeprops typo in the readme btw, says consumprops and injectprops ? would recommend renaming passprops/passhandlers to either exposeprops or exportprops since pass is ambiguous as to whether it's passed in or passed out going to self-close since this is not an issue
