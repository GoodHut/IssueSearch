 URL : "https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-vm/issues/169" TITLE : blockhash is broken BODY : getblockhash expects a buffer : - https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-vm/blob/master/lib/statemanager.js l213 - https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-vm/blob/master/lib/fakeblockchain.js l6 but it always receives a javascript number from the blockhash opcode: https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-vm/blob/master/lib/opfns.js l337 the reason it still works is due to ethereumjs-util in the background transform anything into buffer before it converts them to number in buffertoint .
