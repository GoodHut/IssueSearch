 URL : "https://github.com/Hello23-Ygopro/ygopro-dm/issues/9" TITLE : duel masters update BODY : database - cut the copyright text on the bottom of each card that distinguishes ocg and tcg cards from each other and duel masters cards from yugioh cards. duel masters rules 24000000 - add the untap rule that occurs at the start of the turn to duel masters rules instead. - change the battle destroy rules https://github.com/hello23-ygopro/ygopro-dm/blob/master/script/c24000000.lua l84 to continuous effects so less chain links are formed, and so these rules will always occur first before any individual card's ability. box.enablecreatureattribute c - consider separating the evolution function and using a filter similar to yugioh's xyz procedure.
