 URL : "https://github.com/longevityframework/longevity/issues/33" TITLE : add support for ttl BODY : ttl = time to live both mongodb and cassandra back ends have this feature. i think it would be worth exposing. let's do it clean and in a typesafe way so it is compile error to try to use this on a back end that does not support it. if interested, please ask. i can provide support.
