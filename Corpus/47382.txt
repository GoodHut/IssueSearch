 URL : "https://github.com/Arachni/arachni-ui-web/issues/138" TITLE : parameters inside url BODY : i have been searching around the docs trying to find out if it is at all possible to have wildcards in testing urls that would also be tested for xss/sqli/general fuzzing. for example: https://blah.com/shoppinglist/{wildcardparamhere}/item/{wildcardparamhere}/cost i understand that arachni is great at testing https://blah.com/{anythinghere} so would love to use it for the other scenario.
