 URL : "https://github.com/trasa/watchmud/issues/15" TITLE : builders web application BODY : maybe a totally new project but ... a web application for builders to create / edit zones in a sandbox'd environment. various tools for viewing rooms, editing descriptions, objects and so on. the data store for this would be distinct from the game itself, maybe using git branches of zone files or ...something? then when the builder was ready and, i guess some sort of approval process happened? the data could be published into zone files for later loading into a game environment. see 13
