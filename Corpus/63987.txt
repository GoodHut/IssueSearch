 URL : "https://github.com/kennethjiang/OctoPrint-Anywhere/issues/41" TITLE : feature: public viewing BODY : wondering if you're considering implementing a hard link or even time limited expiring links that could be given to people for unauthenticated viewing with no admin access. i'd like to provide viewing links to customers so they can watch their part be manufactured and this would be perfect. either with a static hard link, or preferably have the ability to create custom links that expire after a defined time period 1 day, 3 days, 5 days, etc... . thanks.
