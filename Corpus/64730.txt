 URL : "https://github.com/biocore/qiita/issues/2444" TITLE : highlight selected prep BODY : fully processed studies i.e. one closedref + 2 3 deblur biom tables with multiple preps make it hard to know which prep is currently selected. i was looking at 10485 with 6 preps and wanted to download all 6 150nt ref-hit deblur tables to merge and analyse them outside of qiita. accidentally, i downloaded one table twice and missed one. i think we could help avoiding this if the gui would somehow highlight which prep is currently selected.
