 URL : "https://github.com/zhizhouzh/clfs-arm64/issues/3" TITLE : gcc and newlib BODY : hi, one thing i noticed in your env_setup.sh file is that you compile the stage1 gcc before glibc is built, and that you use --with-newlib in your configure line. have you tested this yourself? i haven't done a dry-run of the build yet, but last i tried compiling gcc with --with-newlib --without-headers i had compiling errors due to the fact that newlib did not have everything that gcc needed this was on x86 so aarch64 may be different. also, if you do use --with-newlib, how come you don't have newlib compiled? nowhere in your script does it grab the source code for newlib and compile it, so i'm confused as to how this script could theoretically work. https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=newlib-cygwin.git i have yet to be able to build gcc without glibc built first, let alone with newlib. i'd appreciate your feedback on this. thank you!
