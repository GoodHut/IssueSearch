 URL : "https://github.com/sinewalker/dotfiles/issues/29" TITLE : function to list functions BODY : the function keyword should be similar to the alias keyword an list functions. but it doesn't. i would like a functions or similar that can list the declared functions, excluding those beginning with an underscore perhaps a switch --all to include those . something based around something like declare -f|awk !~'declare -f _' '{print $3}'
