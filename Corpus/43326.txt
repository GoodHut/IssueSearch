 URL : "https://github.com/graffen/NLog.Targets.Syslog/issues/66" TITLE : copyright and license BODY : there are a lot of projects adopting the mit license. moreover i looked at nlog and other projects/nuget packages: most times copyright is not set in assemblyinfo.cs and .nuspec files, but is present in the source code. @graffen, @304notmodified i would be happy to understand rules or just your position on the following questions. 1. should we adopt it or stay with apache or use the bsd used by nlog since we depend on it? 2. should we remove copyright from assemblyinfo.cs attributes and .nuspec? 3. which people should be listed in the source file header copyright notice: all contributors, some or only the original creator of the repo? 4. is the copyright always of the contributor who commits or shared between him and the repo owner or transferred from the contributor to the repo owner? thank you!
