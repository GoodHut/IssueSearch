 URL : "https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-subrepo/issues/261" TITLE : git subrepo describe? BODY : is there a way to get current subrepo tags? the use case is that my team and another team are working with the same repository. for them, it is their primary repository, and they periodically tag it with version information. my team uses that repository as a subrepo in a bigger code base, but it would be convenient for us to be able to easily get the current subrepo version we're on. is there something akin to git subrepo describe that we could use to get subrepo tags? i see that subrepo squashes upstream history, so i'm not sure how easy this request is.
