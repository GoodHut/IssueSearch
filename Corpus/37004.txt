 URL : "https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/8535" TITLE : isolate server tests BODY : i noticed while working on 8520, that according to the comment here in the accounts-password tests https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/devel/packages/accounts-password/password_tests_setup.js l107-l118 it seems that test runs are not isolated on the server. while this is more expedient, we should probably explore ways to isolate server test runs. or, if i completely missed this in my research and this _is_ possible today, the comment should be updated and we should rewrite those tests to take advantage of the isolation.
