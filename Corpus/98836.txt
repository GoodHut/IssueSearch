BODY : python noob here. is this code likely to be updated to work with python3? i get various errors trying to use it with python 3.6.2. some are simple and appear to be related to the removal of list.iteritems and dict.iterkeys/values in python3; i've fixed locally and that code now appears to do the right thing. not sure what to do with the below, however: python def __adddetails__ self, checkinfo : fills attributes from a dictionary, uses special handling for the 'type' key auto-load instance attributes from passed in dictionary for key in checkinfo: if key == 'type': if checkinfo key in checktypes: self.type = checkinfo key else: take key from type dict, convert to string for type self.type = checkinfo key .keys .next take value from type dict, store to member of new attrib object.__setattr__ self, self.type, checkinfo key .values .next else: store other key value pairs as attributes object.__setattr__ self, key, checkinfo key the error i get is >>> checks 0 .getdetails traceback most recent call last : file <stdin> , line 1, in <module> file /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pingdomlib/check.py , line 178, in getdetails self.__adddetails__ response.json 'check' file /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pingdomlib/check.py , line 155, in __adddetails__ self.type = checkinfo key .keys .next attributeerror: 'dict_keys' object has no attribute 'next'
