 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/sqlopsstudio/issues/265" TITLE : data and object comparison BODY : - sql operations studio version: 0.23.6 one of my regular tasks is to compare the database schema between the testing/development and productive environment. i want to be able to compare the whole schema, only specific types tables only and only a single object with another database. i also often need to compare the data of a different database or csv file. it would also come in handy being able to use a external comparison/merge tool.
