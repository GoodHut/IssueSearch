 URL : "https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/issues/423" TITLE : buttons, switches ang gpio BODY : hi, i think that the assignment gpios - buttons must be configurable from the web interface. now it's fixed but it will be really useful if i could assign a gpio to a different function. example, using sonoff 4ch: the standard configuration assign gpio00, gpio09, gpio10, gpio14 to button 1, 2, 3, 4 now i can't, from the config module page, change this. i think that it would be really useful to assign, for example gpio09 to a switch or to a sensor. doing this i will have 7 gpios that i can use! at the start of the module i will see the standard assignment but, if needed, it's configurable. what do you think? thanks, bruno
