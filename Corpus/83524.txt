 URL : "https://github.com/CDrummond/cantata/issues/1021" TITLE : cdparanoia -> gnu libcdio BODY : cdparanoia seems to be abandoned since it hasn't been updated since 2008 ! gnu libcdio https://www.gnu.org/software/libcdio/ is actively maintained and includes cdparanoia library and cdparanoia command at the time of writing this, the latest available versions is 10.2+0.94+1 https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/libcdio/libcdio-paranoia-10.2+0.94+1.tar.gz released on 2017-03-25 . could you see if it would be possible to use this wine cantata ? the goal is to avoid packaging some outdated dependencies - even if they still works very well - when actively maintained forks are available. thanks ! i did a test but the cmake script fails to find what it needs: -- could not find cdparanoia missing: cdparanoia_libraries cdparanoia_include_dir
