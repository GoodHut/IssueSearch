 URL : "https://github.com/Wh1teRabbitHU/VirtualDataGrid/issues/1" TITLE : adding cell customization BODY : adding support to customise the display of the cells. each header object should accept contain a customcell option, which is a function with two arguments. one for the cell nodeelement and the other for some useful attributes. like rownumber, rowdata, columnname, cellvalue, etc . the main concern is that it shouldn't allowed to change the width nor the height of the cell, because it will alter the scrolling effect. the other problem can be a constructor-destructor need for a complex cell template handling. like adding datepickers to the cell or generating diagram . it can be handled in the input attribute.
