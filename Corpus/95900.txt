 URL : "https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/20532-DevelopingMicrosoftAzureSolutions/issues/172" TITLE : docx versions of the files BODY : curious as to why simple docx or pdf versions of the lab files are not available here. the download of the .md files and then running a build script is not the most intuitive process for easy distribution of updates, especially with all of the other tools that need to be downloaded first. each time i download one of the open source tools, it seems that there's another open source thingy that needs to be downloaded to make it run. so far i cannot even get the github windows desktop tool to run. could be windows 10 issues. can a build process be part of the release of updated content?
