in 21st century, people are free to do anything of what they want but still one of the difference lies in the number of people involved in tech industry and internet. my session is purely based on how to make internet and technology better by promoting the idea of 'equality in tech'. i will share my experiences from india that how i am fighting this in one of the most populated countries and taking opportunities to tier-two and tier-three cities and how mozilla open leadership program boosted it.we will use the process of 'design thinking'. it will be a fun activity to divide ourselves in groups draw the ideal situation, current situation and a solution. the best will be implemented. what is the goal or outcome of your session?
the goal is to promote equality. the goal is to find how can we reach people who are still inaccessible or who are lost among this noise present on the internet. today, irrelevant information is what we get first on the internet and because of this reason, people can't get what they actually need. the outcome is to get a solution, to promote equality in tech and include diversity. as there are different people from different countries who will join us at mozfest, it will be the best place to have this discussion. if your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.
only a laptop, projector, some markers, sticky notes and white sheets of paper is required. time needed
