 URL : "https://github.com/MarjorieBurghart/VulgateGlaire/issues/5" TITLE : text in italics BODY : text in _italics_ uses <hi rend= italics > ... </hi> as the xml markup. the period full-stop at the end of some canonical psalm titles ought to be placed _before_ the </hi> . structurally, the period is part of the title, and should not be left outside it. visually, it makes little difference.
