 URL : "https://github.com/SecurityFTW/cs-suite/issues/2" TITLE : kali linux aws tested? BODY : i just installed cs_suite on kali linux ami and am trying to get it working. where the instructions indicate to generate a set of readonly aws keys , are there specific policies that i should select to grant this access? i noticed an error for listaccountaliases so i found that permission in the awsquicksightlistiam policy and applied that. this fixed what was a fatal error but i am getting a ton of accessdenied errors as cs.py is now running. also worth noting - another fatal error related to an out of range index 0 occurs when no aliases have been defined. that was easy enough to fix customize the iam url but not a graceful error handling.
