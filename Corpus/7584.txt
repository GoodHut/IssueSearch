BODY : i am experiencing some performance delay when i am playing with pad, could there be some way to reduce the lag/improve performance? i saw some suggestion about adding a hard fps limit, so i am wondering if there could be one at like 60fps, to help cut using compute power on unnecessary frames and make the game smoother.
