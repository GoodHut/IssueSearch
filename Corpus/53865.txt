 URL : "https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh/issues/156" TITLE : expanded regex support BODY : would like the ability to use more advanced regex functions in rules; groupings, series, ors within a subsection of a <regex> statemets, etc.. ... catching evil with all the obfuscation being used is requiring more fine grained matches unfortunately. performance is a concern but i would rather have the ability to use the advanced regex available and let the ossec admin worry about sizing the system appropriately.
