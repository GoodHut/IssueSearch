 URL : "https://github.com/Palindrom/JSON-Patch-OT/issues/5" TITLE : publish on npm BODY : this issue applies to json-patch-ot , json-patch-queue , and json-patch-ot-agent . because many people rely on these repos and use files in src directly. and because we learned the hard way with fast-json-patch that a node module that supports ts and es6 imports and runs in the browser without bundling is buggy here: https://github.com/starcounter-jack/json-patch/issues/140 . my preliminary plan is to do the following: 1 keep the files in src untouched, logic wise. and emit a warning asking people to use the bundle in dist folder. with the option to use a minified bundle. 2 create a new, temporary dir, called newsrc , and put the node friendly files there. bundle them with webpack if needed, and put their compiled browser + node friendly versions in dist . and also make sure to throw a warning in these files to use dist folder in production. these files shouldn't be used at all except for development. everything is in dist . by the time all people start using dist folder, nobody will be using neither src or newsrc . and this will give us the freedom to remove the old files, and rename our new folder to src and live happliy ever after. wdyt @tomalec @warpech?
