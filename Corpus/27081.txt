 URL : "https://github.com/noboxio/tj-python/issues/4" TITLE : command line window BODY : something that could be nice is to have the ability to enter commands wether they be friendly text or literal python code into the code window while it is running the program. this way we could show the kids something like led on and the led turn on. or we could do ledp.setcolor red or whatever we wanted. basically create an interactive console. this could also combine the use of some other terminal techniques i have seen that allow for the screen to be divided into multiple windows so you could have the program running at the top and then have a command area below. this is advanced i know but i know people have taken the time to program some frameworks that allow us to do this. prompt area | | |----------------------------| |debug/output area | | | |command enter area| | | |status bar at bottom| this is just a thought that we can explore. the first version of adding this feature would be to just have 3 threads that output text onto a screen and then use screen to view them simultaneously and then later on it is just combining the output from the 3 different threads or processes or whatever that we end up using to do this.
