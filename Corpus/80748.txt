 URL : "https://github.com/renard/mysql-backup/issues/6" TITLE : update readme with usage BODY : this repo looks super awesome after checking out the source code itself, but for dummies like me, it'd be nice if your readme had at least some simple instructions on how to use this. i'm assuming that i just copy your main script and then have a cron job set to run it whenever i'd like a backup made?
