 URL : "https://github.com/hackmdio/hackmd/issues/322" TITLE : list all available notes BODY : i'm new to hackmd, so i may be missing something, but i found no way to list all available notes. i recently wrote a note with as certain user and then forgot its password. created another user but couldn't retrieve the note i've wrote. i had to go through the db to retrieve the data by manually setting the alias field to some string to be able to open the note in the browser. is there a way to list all available notes? is there a way to configure or change the note alias once it's created?
