 URL : "https://github.com/nickcam/FlareClusterLayer/issues/23" TITLE : graphics not displaying BODY : i have been trying to use your flareclusterlayer with a rest service that returns json of points. i am using the graphicslayer base class load function to call the rest service and store the point data as the flareclusterlayer._data. after that i call the draw function. i can see console log statements when i pan around that tell me if the data is clustered or not during the draw function. i cannot get any graphics to show up on the map. i am not familiar with what part of your code loads the graphics in the view. maybe you have some insight that could help me. thank you much.
