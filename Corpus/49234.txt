 URL : "https://github.com/nterry/AwesomeSockets/issues/13" TITLE : tcpaccept memory leak BODY : i just started checking out awesomesockets, so far so good. one issue.... i'm attempting to make it so the server can have multiple clients connected at once... to do that, it has to be constantly checking for new connections... i do that like this.... private serverclass { isocket listensocket = awesock.tcplisten 14804 ; // create a new thread for listening for connections new thread => { while true { isocket socket = awesock.tcpaccept listensocket, socketcommunicationtypes.nonblocking, connectioncallback ; } } .start ; } private socket connectioncallback isocket socket, exception exception { // do stuff... return socket.getsocket ; } the issue is when i try to make it nonblocking & use the callback, it seems to constantly grow in size until an out of memory exception is thrown . without the nonblocking it works fine. like so... new thread => { while true { isocket socket = awesock.tcpaccept listensocket ; if socket != null { connectioncallback socket, null ; } } } .start ;
