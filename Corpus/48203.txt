 URL : "https://github.com/suin/ishi/issues/1" TITLE : replacing host header BODY : as a lot of people do, we also use dinghy for our development. of course we're using docker containers. i'm wondering something, and i hope you can help me with this. when using ishi with the following command: bash ~/go/bin/ishi --listen 8080 app.xxx.docker i can share my lan ip to my colleagues, and they can check out this new awesome website we're building. i'm having one problem though and i don't know who to fix it. when sharing this ip, it seems like the $_server 'http_host' in php is replaced with app.xxx.docker instead of the lan address:port. when using assets/css, this path cannot be resolved. for example: html <link href= http://app.xxx.docker/media/icons/share.png rel= apple-touch-icon-precomposed > <link rel= stylesheet href= http://app.xxx.docker/css/main.css > when requesting a url like http://app.xxx.docker/css/main.css this cannot be found. it can only be accessed by docker container itself, not by the shared url lan . how to get along with this? do you understand what i'm trying to say?
