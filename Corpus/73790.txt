 URL : "https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2317" TITLE : dependency between tests BODY : is there any way currently to declare some dependency between tests? in an ideal world, i'd love something like this: python import pytest def test_foo : assert false def test_bar : assert true @pytest.depends_on test_foo, test_bar def test_baz : pass where test_baz would fail because at least one of test it depends on failed test_foo . if that doesn't exist yet, would you think it could be a pytest feature? or a good purpose for a plugin?
