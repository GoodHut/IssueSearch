all my 'nomenclature & description' nodes e.g. http://diptera.myspecies.info/content/meoneura-palaestinensis-hennig and images seem to have lost their classification tags. actually it looks like all the content lost the classification tags. image gallery tags are also lost. maybe all tags are lost. same for milichiidae.info and sciaroidea.info.
