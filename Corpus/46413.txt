 URL : "https://github.com/CoolProp/CoolProp/issues/1494" TITLE : make vtpr thread safe BODY : currently, the instances of unifac library are references of the library, which causes threading problem if more than one thread tried to access this library. to allow safe threading, we need to make a copy of the library, so that each thread access it's own library. the reference are defined here https://github.com/coolprop/coolprop/blob/master/src/backends/cubics/vtprbackend.h l42 and here https://github.com/coolprop/coolprop/blob/master/src/backends/cubics/vtprbackend.h l54 , depending on how the backend is instantiated. these create references of a same lib instance https://github.com/coolprop/coolprop/blob/master/src/backends/cubics/vtprbackend.cpp l12 , which is causing the threading issue. as far as i understand, removing the & in the two calls line 42 https://github.com/coolprop/coolprop/blob/master/src/backends/cubics/vtprbackend.h l42 and 54 https://github.com/coolprop/coolprop/blob/master/src/backends/cubics/vtprbackend.h l54 would create copies instead of references. @ibell do you have a mwe i can test to check this thread safe behaviour? it can be in python if not, i'll try to make one.
