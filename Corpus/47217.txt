 URL : "https://github.com/doofy/mxisd-docker/issues/2" TITLE : official docker image BODY : @doofy fyi, i've now made an official docker image for mxisd, see here https://github.com/kamax-io/mxisd/blob/master/dockerfile . differences with yours: - much more compact, it's ~110mb when yours is 1gb - smaller base image alpine jdk instead of the big debian stretch - no build in the docker image, compiled binaries are directly added to the container - docker stop works correctly by using a script for the entry point
