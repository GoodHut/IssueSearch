 URL : "https://github.com/mar10/fancytree/issues/737" TITLE : how to control selection BODY : hi, i'm making a little web app for outline editing. see https://colindavey.github.io/test1/ i'd like to allow control of multiple selection in some of the standard ways: - shift click to extend selection - cmd click to select discontinuous nodes - shift arrow key to extend selection i don't want to have edit boxes. there doesn't seem to be builtin features to allow doing this easily. is that right? so, i may have to implement it myself. do you have any hints for that? if i write code for a click event, how do i tell what shift keys, if any, are down?
