 URL : "https://github.com/ropensci/roweb/issues/286" TITLE : blog is broken BODY : there is now no pagination and all blog posts from day 1 i.e. 2012 show on ropensci.org/blog we'll need to figure out a way to do the tech-posts as a separate blog and not try to filter main blog posts by category which fails because if there are two or more consecutive tech posts, the main blog page goes empty .
