BODY : hello guys. i would like to ask your opinion about scpi support for opendps. scpi standard commands for programmable instruments is industrial standard for controlling of measuring equipment and also programmable power supply over serial/usb/gpib/ethernet. as for opendps i can implement serial version of scpi and it will be compatible with true serial rs-232 , usb over usb-uart adapter and even ethernet wifi over esp8266 or rtl8710af . this give us ability to use standard software anybody using it already? . as for me, i using whis protocol with my oscilloscope, but my software have no support for anything apart this oscilloscope. you can see example command set for power supply here http://www.manson.com.hk/getimage3/index/action/images/name/sdp_scpi_command_list_1_2.pdf and https://github.com/eez-open/psu-firmware/blob/master/doc/scpi%20reference%20guide/eez%20psu%20scpi%20reference%20guide.pdf
