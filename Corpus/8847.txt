 URL : "https://github.com/apollographql/react-docs/issues/212" TITLE : search the docs BODY : it'd be great if the docs had a search field to quickly search for terms and go to the correct page, similar to how the react docs https://facebook.github.io/react/docs work. since this site is implemented with hexo, i found some plugins that could help with this functionality, like https://github.com/louisbarranqueiro/hexo-algoliasearch. is this something you'd like to receive contributions for? has there been any previous effort on this?
