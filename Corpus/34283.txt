 URL : "https://github.com/jlongster/prettier-atom/issues/33" TITLE : can't publish 0.0.10 BODY : @robwise turns out because you published 0.0.10 but didn't update the dependency to 0.0.10, we are now stuck as we can't publish the 0.0.10 again. i also tried publishing 0.0.10b or 0.0.10-real but atom doesn't seem to like it. the plan is to do another smaller release either today or tomorrow and we'll bump everything to 0.0.11. note: this is the first time i ever publish something to apm so there may be a way!
