 URL : "https://github.com/cianfrocco-lab/cryoem-cloud-tools/issues/112" TITLE : jobs not running BODY : ecently i've been having a lot of my jobs maybe ~50% never launch after opening the aws instance. for several refine3d jobs now, it will create an instance, upload all of the particle stacks, but fail to upload the input particles.star file or the reference map. the job never starts, and then shuts down after an hour of idle activity if i don't catch it, move the files myself, and submit the job manually . however, there is never an error generated from relion, so no run.err file. the run.out file always looks like this: inline image 1 any idea? is there a log file for the transfer that i can look at? or any other type of log file that might be useful? the only thing close to an error is this line that gets spit out into the terminal afteri launch the instance, although it shows up on successful and unsuccessful runs: make_bucket failed: s3://rln-aws-tmp-leschziner-rick-oregon an error occurred bucketalreadyownedbyyou when calling the createbucket operation: your previous request to create the named bucket succeeded and you already own it. this isn't a huge issue, if i re-submit the job enough times it will eventually run, but i don't like wasting money on unused aws instances.
