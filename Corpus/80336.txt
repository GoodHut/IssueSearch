 URL : "https://github.com/stevekrouse/WoofJS/issues/490" TITLE : timing of error messages BODY : i taught a student yesterday with the new error message design implemented 396 , and the messages got really annoying as they constantly appeared, disappeared, and changed as she typed. a pro of the error button was you could choose when to see the error message. a con was students often didn't notice it was there. a pro of the current format is you can't ignore it, but on the flip side, it is distracting. looking for a happy medium.
