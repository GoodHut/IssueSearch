 URL : "https://github.com/olofson/audiality2/issues/311" TITLE : a2s constant tables BODY : implement an object type a2_ttable, similar to a2_tconstant and a2_tstring, but holding an array of constant values. requirements: a language construct for defining tables at compile time. support for specifying separately! if low and high indexes should be wrapped, clamped, replaced with a default value, or if low and/or high index should result in a vm exception, aborting the script. support for specifying the base index. default: 0 support for interpolation off/linear/cubic/... when indexed with non-integer values. a simplexp syntax, and vm instructions, for reading items from indexable objects. shorthand syntax + optimization for reading a randomly selected item from a table. optimizations: special vm instructions for when something is known at compile time to be an a2_ttable, where the compiler puts a direct pointer to the object in the program, avoiding the handle lookup overhead.
