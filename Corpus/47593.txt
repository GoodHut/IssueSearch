 URL : "https://github.com/snac-cooperative/snac/issues/85" TITLE : portraits of entities BODY : currently the images associated with an entity are derived via wikidata. thus only those entities with matches in wikidata have a portrait or associated image . while we do plan to one day be able to contribute identities to wikipedia/wikidata, and perhaps contribute portraits, we also need to consider being able to associate portraits within snac. what technically would we need to do to enable this? what semantics would we use on an archival resource link to a portrait? that is, what will we call the type, and the arc role? i am inclined to think that the role would be xlink:role= http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/control/term digitalarchivalresource‚Äù would the portrait ever be considered other than a archival resource? even a photograph of a work of art would be an archival record, as it is not the artwork, but a record of the artwork. and for the arc role, i would suggest: xlink:arcrole= http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/control/term digitalimageof or some such. what does wikidata call it? foaf calls it foaf:depiction http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/ term_depiction ultimately i would like to use a ric-o property for this, but the issue has not yet been discussed by egad. i will raise the issue with the ric-o group.
