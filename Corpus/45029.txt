BODY : hello everyone, i have checked in branches for some of the c supdup versions. there's one for @bictorv, one branched off that for @wsgac. the klh10 code is in a separate branch until i figure out how it relates to the others. i'll take other versions if i can find them. i believe @ams has one. other supdup hackers out there? @mmcm, @leighklotz?
