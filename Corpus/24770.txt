 URL : "https://github.com/google/shaka-player/issues/899" TITLE : timecode of stream BODY : have you read the faq https://goo.gl/je1sy5 and checked for duplicate issues : yes what version of shaka player are you using : 2.1.3 can you reproduce the issue with our latest release version :yes can you reproduce the issue with the latest code from master :yes are you using the demo app or your own custom app :own player if custom app, can you reproduce the issue using our demo app :no mpd protected with cors , but it can be reproduced with clear shaka library locally. what browser and os are you using : all what are the manifest and license server uris : you can send the uris to <shaka-player-issues@google.com> instead, but please use github and the template for the rest exampld of mpd is in first comment what did you do? started a stream with embemed timecode. what did you expect to happen? player time line shoud be the same as timecode of stream. i expected that player takes information about current time position from segments. but it seems to that player do some calculations getplayheadtimeasdate . client and server that makes mpeg-dash is ntp syncronized. initial 20 seconds shift i suppose can explain maybe it is some bug or feature of packager - but shift is moving ahead. i cannot understand how, beacuse i do sure that stream time code is not shifting - i checked it with a shedule of airs we have and burn-in timecode packager burn in time code on a picture - and we checked then segments timecode with sencore - they are the same, on a picture and on segment metadata . what actually happened? in player timeline there is a difference between it and time of stream ~ 20 seconds. and it shifts from one day to another 19,18,17...etc - approximate 0,3 seconds per day
