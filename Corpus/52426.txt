 URL : "https://github.com/antirez/redis/issues/4052" TITLE : cluster auto rebalance BODY : copied from https://github.com/antirez/redis/issues/3009 on node join/leave/fail, the cluster should automatically reallocate unallocated slots to other masters in the cluster. specifically: - on join, the new master should get an even share of the available slots. - on leave, the old master should rebalance its own slots evenly among all other masters before actually leaving the cluster. - on fail, there are two things to consider: - if the master has any slaves: the slave will take control over its slots, and a reshard of master/slave status for the cluster might happen see next section . - master is slave-less: the now-missing slots should get automatically reallocated evenly between the remaining masters in the cluster.
