 URL : "https://github.com/xivdb/api/issues/10" TITLE : increase request limit BODY : i've created a crafting application which relies on api.xivdb to resolve its informations. example page: https://ffxivteamcraft.firebaseapp.com/list/mut5hgtisyukasb20kdgjbhdaux2/-krnc_fmiwkviflsvcux that being said, i often get some errors from the server, making some rows of the list empty you can see it when going on the page with no cache . is it planned to increase the actual api call limit? i mean, because we don't have a full recursion see 9 we have to do a lot of queries in order to resolve some deep informations.
