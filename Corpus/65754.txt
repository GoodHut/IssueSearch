 URL : "https://github.com/CompuIves/codesandbox-client/issues/422" TITLE : last modified timestamp BODY : we're planning to use codesandbox as part of a hiring process to provide candidates with a starter project, have them fork it and make a few updates, then submit their fork. i'm trying to figure out a good way to check that candidates are not editing a sandbox after submission. it seems like a lightweight approach might be capturing a last updated timestamp. if we capture the same on our side, we could compare those timestamps to determine if a sandbox was edited. it looks like updated_at timestamps are not currently returned in the json payload when fetching a sandbox, but i'm guessing you're tracking this server-side anyway. this could be useful on a per-sandbox or per-file basis. versioning could solve this problem as well, although that seems like a heavier lift. another idea we had was downloading a zip file of the repo upon submission. am i missing something obvious and there's a good solution already in place? if not, i'm happy to submit a pr, although there would need to be server-side changes and it seems like that repo is private. p.s. thanks for all the hard work on codesandbox! this is a great tool and i'm excited to use it for both personal and professional projects.
