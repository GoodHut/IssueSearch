 URL : "https://github.com/docker/machine/issues/4320" TITLE : clarify project status BODY : would it be possible to add a visible notice on the project's front page or at least contributing.md that no new features are being accepted? it's a bit discouraging for community contributors to spend the time trying to help, only to get rejected. examples: https://github.com/docker/machine/pull/4287 issuecomment-338842549 https://github.com/docker/machine/pull/4280 issuecomment-338842944 https://github.com/docker/machine/pull/4254 issuecomment-338843050 ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7232674/33466379-944e67b2-d61b-11e7-8bcd-ef727eb4ca35.png
