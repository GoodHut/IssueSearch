 URL : "https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro/issues/53" TITLE : formatjs custom formats BODY : in the fulcro devcards it's mentioned how formatjs is extensible; however, i don't see any way to pass a formats object to messageformat. as i understand it, the messageformat constructor can take the formats object as the third parameter, but fulcro.i18n/trf is hardcoded to only pass two https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro/blob/develop/src/main/fulcro/i18n.cljc l58 . could we get an option in new-fulcro-client or an atom in fulcro.i18n where we can set custom formats?
