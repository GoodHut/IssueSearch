 URL : "https://github.com/nicolasdelfino/react-metro/issues/8" TITLE : metro - react native BODY : currently doesn't work with react native due to behind the scenes divs in wrapping component. today we have wrappertype arg that replaces the outmost top component as the specified type passed in div / ul / li and so on. but it doesn't affect sister nodes. thinking there are three options: one could be a setting you could set before using metro - e.g metro.native true , second option could be on sequence level & third option would be wrapping div to view. either way the solution should replace all instances throughout metro.
