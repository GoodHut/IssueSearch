 URL : "https://github.com/puphpet/puphpet/issues/2730" TITLE : centos php-fpm pid path BODY : originally addressed the issue at 1589 in 2015 my specific case is with php 5.6 and centos 6.8 . in the puppet params /puphpet/puppet/modules/puphpet/manifests/php/params.pp it is set to: puppet $pid_file = $::osfamily ? { 'debian' => '/run/php-fpm.pid', 'redhat' => '/var/run/php-fpm.pid', } in /etc/init.d/php-fpm it is hard-coded as: bash pidfile=${pidfile-/var/run/php-fpm/php-fpm.pid} while this does lead to a bit of confusion when provisioning, it can be worked around in the /puphpet/config.yml file until it is patched as: yaml php: ... fpm_ini: pid_file: /var/run/php-fpm/php-fpm.pid
