 URL : "https://github.com/brain-lang/brainfuck/issues/4" TITLE : optimize by default BODY : this brainfuck interpreter is used for running code, so it isn't necessarily useful to simulate a turing machine exactly. some optimizations should be enabled by default. in particular, grouping instructions before execution should be on by default. batching instructions like this greatly speeds up interpretation. in debug mode, default to having optimizations off unless an optimization flag is explicitly passed in . but make sure optimizations can be enabled afterwards if requested by the debugger.
