 URL : "https://github.com/olifolkerd/tabulator/issues/625" TITLE : problems with updatedata BODY : i am getting the following error message in the console when i use the updatedata function to update my table using an ajax request via php to a mysql database: tabulator.min.js:3 uncaught typeerror: t.foreach is not a function at t. anonymous function . anonymous function .updatedata i am returning the data correctly to tabulator as json encoded array of objects - i know that the data is being returned properly because when i use setdata instead of updatedata with exactly the same ajax request and php file everything works perfectly and the data from my database is returning correctly - i don't want to keep calling setdata however as this is extremely memory intensive and eventually causes the browser to crash. any ideas why updatedata is not working whereas setdata is?
