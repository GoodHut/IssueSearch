 URL : "https://github.com/datasets/geo-countries/issues/10" TITLE : data deprecated source BODY : i am working through the tutorials found at https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/colors.html https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/colors.html . they say that data is pulled from http://data.okfn.org/data/datasets/geo-boundaries-world-110m data http://data.okfn.org/data/datasets/geo-boundaries-world-110m data which then leads me to this github page for more maintained packages. however, pulling this data in is not functioning with the steps given in the tutorial. have changes been made to the data? thank you.
