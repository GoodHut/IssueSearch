 URL : "https://github.com/clangen/musikcube/issues/171" TITLE : split core from cube? BODY : i would like to propose splitting the actual daemon from the client, like mpd or xmms2 do. the musikcube client can still autostart the core, if it's not running already. main advantage for such an aproach is the ability to have a proper daemon one can start on headless servers without screen/tmux hacks.
