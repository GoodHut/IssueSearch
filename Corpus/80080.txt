 URL : "https://github.com/evincarofautumn/kitten/issues/189" TITLE : syntax highlighting mode BODY : we need a mode that accepts a source file and just performs syntax highlighting. based on 177 it should recover from lexical errors as much as possible so that all inputs produce some reasonable output. take this fragment as an example: define hello it should be able to produce raw syntax highlighting information consisting of source spans and lexical categories for each token in json: { token : define , category : keyword , line : 1, from : 1, to : 6}, { token : hello , category : identifier , line : 1, from : 8, to : 12}, { token : , category : symbol , line : 1, from : 14, to : 14} it should also be able to directly generate a syntax-highlighted source file as html, preserving formatting: <span class='kitten keyword'>define</span> <span class='kitten identifier'>hello</span> <span class='kitten symbol'> </span> other output formats such as sourcemaps, rtf, and latex would be nice to have but arenâ€™t critical.
