 URL : "https://github.com/pellaeon/fb-post-bulk-privacy-edit/issues/4" TITLE : incorrect facebook id BODY : the website https://findmyfbid.com/ reported an incorrect id. this caused the get request from graph.facebook.com to fail. the following workaround works: visit https://graph.facebook.com/v2.5/me?fields=id%2cname%2cposts&access_token=<enter your access token here> and copy the _id_ field after fixing this, the script finds the post ids and is able to hide them.
