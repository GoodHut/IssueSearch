 URL : "https://github.com/tensorflow/serving/issues/559" TITLE : add request metadata BODY : the current api seems to be targeting single-purpose scenarios, where one instance covers one class of users only. it should be extended to support metadata attached to requests. example use cases of tags that the client can attach: - qos/priority, so that the server can track the importance of single requests and schedule them accordingly, also shedding expendable ones when under pressure - caller service. two requests might come in from the same user, but they serve different purposes. this can be useful for quota enforcement or for accounting/monitoring/troubleshooting reasons. - arbitrary, opaque tags client binary version, request id, experiment id, etc. . useful again for accounting/monitoring/troubleshooting, e.g. to propagate in rpc traces. these could be already implemented today as free-form grpc metadata, but at least some such as qos should be part of the request protobuf definition, so they have stable, standard names, which components like the scheduler can then rely on. follow up issues can focus on making use of the above, namely scheduling and tracking metrics based on the metadata.
