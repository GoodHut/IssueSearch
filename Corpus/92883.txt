 URL : "https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage/issues/1919" TITLE : about url contains chinese BODY : about url contains chinese my url has chinese, so this image will not show,i found the reason. the url can not be used directly,use the following methods: imageview sd_setimagewithurl: nsurl urlwithstring: myurl stringbyaddingpercentescapesusingencoding:nsutf8stringencoding placeholderimage: uiimage imagenamed:@ placeholder_picture ; but i have so many urls,so i need this setting like that every time. so i'd like to make a suggestion about my issue whether 'nsutf8stringencoding' can be integrated into the framework?
