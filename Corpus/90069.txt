BODY : hello all, we want to control a real kuka iiwa robot using the iiwa_hw part of this package. as you can see in the attached picture first we got the error : robot is not connected. and after that couldn't find an af_inet adress for fe80 . we already tried the solution you find with google like changing the export statement in .bashrc from localhost to the actual ip but that did not solve anything. we think it could be related to the ipv6 since the kuka handheld outputs something like fe80:0:0:0:0%efe:c0a8:1 as the robot ip. we are using the kuka sunrise version 1.9.1.7. ! 20170106_162358 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5571947/21724907/6f084b5e-d436-11e6-81aa-da9bc490c32f.jpg ! 20170106_161139 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5571947/21724921/7313ce12-d436-11e6-893e-21e79b13e7b3.jpg thanks for your help.
