BODY : i don't think any sane person is ever going to rail mount a maglite to the _top_ of their battle rifle in a way that completely obscures the iron sights. this weapon looks absurdly silly and really has no place amongst the other weapons. if we can't remove the flashlight from the top of the gun, i say remove the gun from the game. ! hk33a2 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7231744/26032188/f2969fc4-3841-11e7-92cd-d6d53c9f4627.png
