 URL : "https://github.com/dannyvankooten/browserpass/issues/138" TITLE : sign released binaries? BODY : since we're dealing with pretty sensitive data here i.e. plaintext passwords , our host binary actually becomes a relatively large attack surface. i think it would be good if we would in some way establish our authenticity when releasing new packages. now i'm not actually sure how one would go about doing this, but i figure pgp-signing the zip probably using a detached signature would be a step in the right direction i guess. note that this is not so much a feature request or suggestion than an attempt to start a discussion on this. i'm sure somebody else can come up with more sensible approaches than me.
