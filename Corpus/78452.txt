 URL : "https://github.com/askmike/gekko/issues/637" TITLE : promise error on startup BODY : hello, i'm trying to use the develop branch to try out the ui. i am getting the error below when running node gekko --ui node:27792 unhandledpromiserejectionwarning: unhandled promise rejection rejection id: 1 : error: exited with code 3 i am running gekko on a debian headless install using an orange pi for hardware. i am trying to access the site using chrome running on windows 10 over the internal network. when ever i try to attach to the site, i get a disconnected message on the page saying something went wrong in the console and there are no other error messages. i did modify the uiconfig.js so that it binds to the internal ip address rather than localhost. just in case the ui uses that as data that makes up absolute paths for api calls. however, i still get the disconnected message, but oddly enough if i go to the url with /api/strategies instead of / /home i will get json back. if you could provide a place to look i would greatly appreciate it. thank you and great work!!!
