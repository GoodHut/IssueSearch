 URL : "https://github.com/interfacewerk/iwerk-angular-ui/issues/18" TITLE : module loading indicator BODY : lazy loaded angular modules are fetched from the client to the server. if the network is a bit slow this can result in a ui that does nothing until the module is loaded and started. there could be a module loading indicator component that displays a nice loading indicator until the module is fetched. what do you thing @mochtu ? poc: we can use the routeconfigloadstart, routeconfigloadend events from the router. they are fired when a module needs to be loaded.
