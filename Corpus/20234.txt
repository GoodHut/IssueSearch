 URL : "https://github.com/php-cache/issues/issues/121" TITLE : cache util package BODY : it would be nice if the php-cache ecosystem had a util package that implemented utility functions on top of the psr-6 and psr-16 interfaces. an example function would be something like. php <?php namespace cache\util; use psr\simplecache\cacheinterface; function remember cacheinterface $cache, $key, $ttl, callable $fetch { $res = $cache->get $key ; if $res { return $res; } $res = $fetch ; $cache->set $key, $value, $ttl ; return $res; } usage: php $cache = new arraycache ; $res = cache\util\remember $cache, 'key', 3600, function { // return some expensive query here. } ; i can't think of any other utility functions, but that is a very common pattern when accessing cache items.
