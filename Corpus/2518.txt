 URL : "https://github.com/gnea/grbl/issues/295" TITLE : alarm 1 state BODY : every time i enable the hard limit switches and enter a move command grbl locks up. initially i thought that this was a limit switch problem but if i show the verbose window and leave grbl in the alarm state on startup i can see that the limit switches are operating properly. i.e. when one is pressed the corresponding pn-x,y,z,p is displayed ! screen shot 2017-10-21 at 15 07 43 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32982601/31852562-a52a565a-b671-11e7-8b22-a9592e22ad08.png you can see where i depressed and released the x limit switch here
