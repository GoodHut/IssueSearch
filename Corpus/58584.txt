 URL : "https://github.com/OpenLiveWriter/OpenLiveWriter/issues/691" TITLE : space between pictures BODY : previously when i imported pictures into a post being created in owl, they came in with a line or two between them into which text could be written. i've updated to the latest owl version and now there is no space at all. i can select the photo after inserting it and change the margins so that the pictures are not directly beneath each other but nothing can be types into this space. did i inadvertently change something when i upgraded? it's a lot of trouble to move the pictures further apart if i select two or three at a time. thanks for the help.
