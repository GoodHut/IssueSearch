 URL : "https://github.com/RiskyKen/Armourers-Workshop/issues/210" TITLE : wings as backpack BODY : i'm thinking of using wings to make backpack-like skins, such as scuba tank, gliders static wings etc. for example: i tried to mimic a mekanism jetpack. ! 2017-01-04_02 01 54 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6743303/31225890-65d5d53e-a9aa-11e7-81d6-06a287fb0c3a.png but the chest bounding box is quite limited. ! 2017-01-04_01 58 57 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6743303/31225907-7e8486fc-a9aa-11e7-81ca-188695deca48.png the wing addition has opened that possibility. i could set wing angles to zero to disable the flapping animation, and place the markers anywhere. my question is, since i'm making something not expected, can i make wings this way without any problem? _suggestion:_ an animated wings? checkbox in the skin settings tab would enable/disable the wing options. _nitpick suggestion:_ is it possible to align the torso model in the wing mode with the torso model in the chest mode? because if i want to compare the chest skin with the wing skin or reuse bits of it, the skins will be 2 blocks off n-s ward.
