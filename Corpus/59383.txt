 URL : "https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues/4877" TITLE : turbodbc conda package BODY : hi there! i am the developer of the turbodbc https://github.com/blue-yonder/turbodbc package that aims to be the odbc database adapter for data science. key selling points over pyodbc, for example, are fast batched data transfer in both directions and built-in extensions for numpy and apache arrow data types that leverage binary database buffers rather than an army of small, needlessly created python objects. i just browsed the anaconda package list https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/packages/pkg-docs and realized that turbodbc is not there yet, so i would like to change that. friendly people have already uploaded conda packages to conda forge https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/turbodbc for linux py 2.7+ , osx py 2.7+ , and windows python 3.5+ only . this leads me to hope that only limited effort is required to bring turbodbc to the official anaconda package list. please let me know if i can help or if there are obstacles that prevent turbodbc from being added just yet.
