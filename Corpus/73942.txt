 URL : "https://github.com/lxde/qterminal/issues/311" TITLE : discussion: coding style BODY : current coding styles in qterminal as well as qtermwidget are quite inconsistent. it would be better to have a universal coding style. 1. identation. there are several places with mixed spaces and tabs. i prefer spaces everywhere. 2. & and in reference and pointer types, respectively. there are at least three patterns: foo& foo , foo & foo , foo &foo . i like the first. the third is also fine. 3. do we need brackets for control flow blocks with only one statement? for example: if foo bar ; and if foo { bar ; } i like the second as it's clearer. any thoughts?
