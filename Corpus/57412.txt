 URL : "https://github.com/Letudiant/composer-shared-package-plugin/issues/20" TITLE : provide binary support BODY : a common problem of using this plugin is that it breaks the location of the autoloader when a package with binary is installed: also see phpunit composer binary broken after install https://github.com/letudiant/composer-shared-package-plugin/issues/12 . to give you an example, this is the bootstrap code of phing: https://github.com/phingofficial/phing/blob/master/bin/phing.php l10 php // use composers autoload.php if available if file_exists __dir__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php' { require_once __dir__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php'; } elseif file_exists __dir__ . '/../../../autoload.php' { require_once __dir__ . '/../../../autoload.php'; } because the binary's file location has moved it will not be able to locate the autoload.php file. as a solution i propose to run an extra composer install for packages that provide a binary. before we do that we need to alter the packages' composer.json to make use of the spp. the install will take a couple extra seconds to build the dependency symlinks. but after composer install has run the package will have access to it's own autoload.php file. we could provide spp users with an option to enable or disable binary install. please let me know if you like the idea and i'll provide you with a patch. best regards, alex
