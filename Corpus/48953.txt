 URL : "https://github.com/ktbs/ktbs/issues/66" TITLE : strange error message BODY : this happened when i mistakenly tried to put the following graph: <> a :computedtrace ; :hasmethod <./myusermethod> ; ... instead of: <> a :computedtrace ; :hasmethod <../myusermethod> ; ... i got the following error message: 405 method not allowed edit individual obsel not supported yet; edit through obselcollection instead my interpretation is that ./myusermethod is seen as an obsel uri which makes sense, given that it is under the uri of the trace , and so ktbs believes that i'm trying to put an obsel description -- while it should realize that i'm trying to put the trace description instead...
