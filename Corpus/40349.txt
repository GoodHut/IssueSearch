 URL : "https://github.com/Greymerk/minecraft-roguelike/issues/85" TITLE : trouble with configs BODY : hi, with looting:0 mobs drop loot normal and armor/weapons and how can i remove some mobspawners from all the dungeons, i added _mobs.json to the settings folder with the names of the mobs that i want to be spawned but that isnt affecting the dungeons, other mobs still spawn, do i have to add other files? is possible to do what i want to do without changing any other feature of the mod? also i tryed to add nbt data to the mobs, this is how i did it: { name : mobs , levels : { all : { spawners : { silverfish : { name : silverfish } , cavespider : { name : cavespider } , spider : { name : spider } { meta : {attributes: {name: generic.maxhealth ,base:100.0} } } } } } } is everything right there? thanks!
