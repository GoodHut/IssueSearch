 URL : "https://github.com/scoutapp/scout_apm_elixir/issues/33" TITLE : absinthe plug update BODY : the absinthe plug no longer works as of version 0.3 https://gist.github.com/itsderek23/d9435b21c9a44cd9629e93c4e8c2750e seems it's due to trackedrequest.start_layer and trackedrequest.stop_layer accepting modules instead of strings as the first argument. would it be possible to make an update to that gist? thanks!
