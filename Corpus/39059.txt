 URL : "https://github.com/headswe/Swifty/issues/198" TITLE : repo missmatch error BODY : i have been stuck with this one for 2 months. no one else in my group has the issue. i have tried uninstalling swifty and all its associated folders at least those i could find and also uninstall the associated mods from arma. when i reinstall swifty and direct it to the repository web address, i instantly get the error. apparently i am not starting from scratch completely.
