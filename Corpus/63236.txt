 URL : "https://github.com/sindresorhus/is/issues/36" TITLE : directinstanceof method BODY : sometimes it's useful to be able to check if something is a direct instance of a class. instanceof also matches any subclasses of that type, which is not always desirable. js const directinstanceof = instance, klass => object.getprototypeof instance === klass.prototype; it's not a lot of code, but i always forget how to do it properly, so would be nice to have a check for this.
