 URL : "https://github.com/gosquared/flags/issues/16" TITLE : licence for the flags BODY : hi! i see that your project is licenced under mit, but usually mit licence applies to code, not to the media files. so i was wondering, under which licence are the flags themselves? when i use them on my commercial project, do i have to provide credit on my website or something like that?
