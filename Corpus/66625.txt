 URL : "https://github.com/ddeboer/imap/issues/200" TITLE : need getall for headers BODY : because headers and parent class parameters are not iterable it's impossible to get headers if you don't know what the headers are. also in some cases, it would be more useful to return all headers within an array than to iterate over them cost of copy vs iteration where copy or filter would be implemented
