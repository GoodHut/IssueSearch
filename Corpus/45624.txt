 URL : "https://github.com/cboxdoerfer/fsearch/issues/86" TITLE : improve hidpi support BODY : fsearch does provide some sort of hidpi support, but it is far from ideal: the menus are not spaced enough, their dropdowns don't cast drop shadows like they do in qt 5-based applications and the icons are too small. it's also much harder than usual to resize the columns, because the dragging areas' sizes do not increase with scaling. this was tested with a build of https://github.com/cboxdoerfer/fsearch/commit/0871f542dc6e50c88cc1fdce5c158b4d3cc2f49e on manjaro linux using kde plasma 5.9.5. the system theme is breath, applied on native, gtk+2 and gtk+3 applications, but this issue also happens with the breeze theme the plasma default . some screenshots fsearch and, for comparison, a qt 5-based application, krita with 200% scaling can be seen below. ! fsearch_kde https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/180032/26407843/7ed5b31e-409c-11e7-9b91-4f7f6559fef0.png ! krita_kde https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/180032/26407849/84c35c5e-409c-11e7-9b61-c21a96efd23e.png
