 URL : "https://github.com/aerohub/phugo/issues/6" TITLE : albums within albums BODY : feature request i installed this theme last night and have been experimenting with it since then. a friend of mine was looking over my shoulder while i showed him the test site and he brought up the idea of albums within albums. i thought maybe i could make it work by using the command to create an album inside an existing album. for example: hugo new first-album/second-album/_index.md however, this did not work. the 'second-album' still shows up on the root index just like any other album. would this be something that could be added as a new feature? if not, perhaps you could give me pointers on how to make this change myself? thanks!
