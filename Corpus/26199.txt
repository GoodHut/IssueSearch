 URL : "https://github.com/Smurfffy/Chapp/issues/7" TITLE : adding a third tier BODY : having just firebase and ionic isn't going to be good enough for our application so we are going to have to change it to a three tier application. i'm thinking of adding in node.js/socket.io as the server side and then have mongodb as the database and ionic as the front end. then serving it with firebase. what do ye think of that idea?
