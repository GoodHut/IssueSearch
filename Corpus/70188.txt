 URL : "https://github.com/groob/go-simian/issues/1" TITLE : use cgo instead of exec BODY : there are several things that we're currently doing by calling exec , like setting preferences or reading data from system_profiler . these could be easily accomplished by doing cgo . unfortunately my c knowledge is somewhat limited. i managed to scrape together some code under internal/cprefs to at least read cfpreferences data. i'm going to forge ahead with using exec but this issue is here to keep track of something that would be nice to update at some point.
