http://ift.tt/2jcqwno<br><p>at tophatch, we delight and empower creative people. our powerful, award-winning design tools simplify the creative process with smarter, more intuitive technology. you could say we&rsquo;re building the future of design. and we&rsquo;d love your help. <a href= http://ift.tt/1kuft8v rel= nofollow >check out concepts in the app store.</a></p>
<br><p>we're on the lookout for an experienced software engineer to work on our ipad/iphone application. we are looking for someone who is passionate about building great mobile software. someone who loves to hack, but can then turn this into a high quality, stable deliverable that our customers will love. someone who is comfortable iterating on a feature until it is done, however many cycles that takes. maybe that's you?</p>
<br><p>our preference is to employ someone in a location that we already have employees, so our turku office in finland, or a remote position in usa, united kingdom, spain or romania. but for the right person we will hire you wherever you are.</p>
