 URL : "https://github.com/hyperrealm/libconfig/issues/74" TITLE : q outdated on centos 6 BODY : centos 6 uses version 1.3.2 in the base and seems no updates to it. so thats why i found out the examples that i found here did not work/compile. do you maintain that centos 6 package? please update it. i hope i can use this, hardcoding things is not right : thank you for the lib. i hope to recreate my windows visual basic tool in linux. using gtk2/c/eclipse. tho visual coding on linux sucks a bit : i dont like glade, why is it all in boxes.. why not drag a element on the window where i want it :- anyway different story. again thanx for the lib. i go try to make a own rpm package with libconfig current version and hope it works : until then, hardcoded val's.
