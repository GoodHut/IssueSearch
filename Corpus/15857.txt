 URL : "https://github.com/uhlryk/react-dynamic-number/issues/31" TITLE : fraction is error BODY : let's say i have 2 input fields. both of them have fraction={1} . when i input in first field 2.35 , in visual it is 2.3 and that's what i want. but when i move to second field, then i start to input some values, the first field's value become to 0 again. then i reload page. now, i input in first field 2.3 , then i move to second field and i start to input some values, the first field is fine with value 2.3 . i think there's something missed with fraction props. is it possible to fix this?
