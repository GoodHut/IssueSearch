 URL : "https://github.com/eribertomota/axel/issues/44" TITLE : file name error BODY : hi all, i seem to be experiencing a file name parsing issue. i run axel -a -n 6 -v -s 204800 https://something.url.com/d/p/longalphastring/name%20of%20file.zip and the file name the results in being downloaded is name rather than name of file.zip which leads me to believe it's not parsing the spaces. other computers with axel older osx version and axel versions run without this malformed name. also browsers safari, firefox, chrome, etc. all seem to be able to handle the url and generate the full file name. example: axel -a -n 6 -v -s 204800 https://something.url.com/d/p/longalphastring/name%20of%20file.zip initializing download: https://something.url.com/d/p/longalphastring/name%20of%20file.zip file size: 165596 bytes opening output file name starting download 0% 0 1 .2 3 4 5 76.2kb/s 1h10 platform data: macos sierra 10.12.2 16c68 axel: stable 2.12, head light unix download accelerator https://github.com/eribertomota/axel /users/rjeong/homebrew/cellar/axel/2.12 15 files, 133k built from source on 2017-01-12 at 21:05:19 from: https://github.com/homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/formula/axel.rb ==> dependencies build: autoconf ✔, automake ✔ required: gettext ✔, openssl ✔ thanks
