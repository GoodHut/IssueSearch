 URL : "https://github.com/ramda/ramda/issues/2074" TITLE : tap with promise chains BODY : i'd like to add tap variant to a promise chain from composep or pipep with the idea that the tap is dealing with a promise. does a tapp function have any use? or do we just do var tapp = function fn { return function promise { return promise .then function x { fn x ; return promise; } ; }; };
