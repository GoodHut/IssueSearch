 URL : "https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles/issues/484" TITLE : tags not recognized BODY : hi! i'm experiencing some issues with pickles at the moment. i've been using the gui version and for some reason certain tags are not being recognized from within my feature file. i've been generating a dhtml and upon searching for a specific tag, not all of the results are shown. we've noticed an odd pattern, some tags that are part of specific examples cannot be found. but please not that this is not a definitive statement, some are found! an example of this would be: scenario outline: @tag_example examples: | x | y | | 1 | 2 | any help would be greatly appreciated thanks!
