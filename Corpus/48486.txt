 URL : "https://github.com/psifidotos/Latte-Dock/issues/666" TITLE : scroll wheel behavior BODY : hello, great work with the update! i have two suggestions. 1. don't open applications if you hover over a icon and use the scroll wheel, we can already press left or middle mouse button to open. like this it will cause more headaches because of accidentally opening application. 2. don't minimize a window if only one instance is open and you use scroll wheel while hovering. the scroll wheel is just too sensitive for this action, you windows will just mini/max a few times per second. in my opinion it would be better if scroll wheel always meant scroll through instances or show me the open one.
