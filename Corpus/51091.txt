 URL : "https://github.com/Featurion/LookUp/issues/14" TITLE : add public group chats BODY : when we release, we are going to have two types of group chats: private, and public. private group chats will be similar to the group chats on skype, while public group chats will be open unless banned, of course and searchable via a search box in the ui similar to how there will be a search box to locate other users when we implement a contact list .
