 URL : "https://github.com/J535D165/recordlinkage/issues/39" TITLE : increase logging verbosity BODY : currently, recordlinkage logs very few events. however, if more events were logged, users could track the progress of their recordlinkage code while it runs, which would be especially useful for large computations which take a long time to run. events which might be logged could include beginning/ending a new stage i.e. indexing, comparing, classifying, fusing , and beginning/ending jobs within this stage. using the current api, it is easy enough for the user to include logging/print statements in between method calls. however, this will become difficult when the pipeline api is introduced and all major computations are initiated by a single class, and are executed in parallel.
