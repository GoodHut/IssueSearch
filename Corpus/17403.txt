 URL : "https://github.com/jaap-karssenberg/zim-desktop-wiki/issues/274" TITLE : pascal case links BODY : when i write text using pascalcase upper camel case , it is automatically transformed into a link to a new page. the page is not created, but is visible and greyed out in the index. isn't it confusing for the user? also, i can't see anything about this feature in help. for example, type fad anywhere and the colour changes to blue. pascal case words shouldn't be automatically transformed into links.
