 URL : "https://github.com/ip1981/nixsap/issues/8" TITLE : add ssh-agent app BODY : add ssh-agent app multiple instances . this app should support options for unix socket, user to run as the socket owner , and list of private ssh keys and pass-phrases? . when deployed, the unix socket is exposed to other applications via the ssh_auth_sock environment variable. possible consumers: jenkins. note, that jenkins has the ssh-agent plugin, which does exactly the same, but it has some bugs, and separate ssh-agent application is more general solution.
