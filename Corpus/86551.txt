 URL : "https://github.com/xhqiao89/HydroDesktop_test/issues/442" TITLE : hydromodeler filename bug BODY : <b>rfboykin codeplex </b> <br />when saving a model, the default name is quot directory name quot instead of simply the file name. for example, when i try to save water_sediment_concentration.opr, the default file name shown is: quotc:\hydrodesktop\binaries\plugins\hydromodeler\example_configuration\water_sediment_concentrationquot instead of just quotwater_sediment_concentrationquot. regardless, the file is still saved with the name at the end. i am reporting this as a minor cosmetic bug.
