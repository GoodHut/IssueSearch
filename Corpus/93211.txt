 URL : "https://github.com/decidim/decidim/issues/2175" TITLE : add link to activity items BODY : this is a tiny feature proposal :tophat: description just a piece of feedback on a possible ux improvement, specially for new users. when users go to a specific process page and start reading the front page info, it's possible that they engage and reach the end of the page. there, at the bottom, there's a nice section that informs you about the process activities proposals, meetings... , which can easily call the attention of the engaged users. unfortunately, the activities don't link to the content and users have to look for those by themselves. check the gif ðŸ˜Š what if we linked 99 propostes and 18 trobades presencials to the pages that actually hold the content? it's a minor change that could improve new users' engagement, and probably doesn't prevent them to learn the standard main page navigation. :pushpin: related issues :clipboard: additional data ! http://g.recordit.co/cecvr441ha.gif
