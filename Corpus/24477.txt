 URL : "https://github.com/lhc70000/iina/issues/217" TITLE : suggestions on osc BODY : > i prefer shortcut keys myself, but anyway, i'm not sure why we haven't yet changed the volume bar paradigm and make it circular. not only fits the size of the other icons and ui symmetry , but it's also easy to control with a trackpad/mouse. > > i think it's way easier to click anywhere on a round icon and move up/down to turn the volume up/down than to aim at a thin bar or small knob. sometimes it's so badly implemented that moving a bit up or down while we're moving left or right while holding left click , will take the pointer out of the slider bar, losing focus. > > example volume icon > > ! qjhae https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9649385/21933348/f5ed7656-d99c-11e6-8abf-a47659c0a9d0.png > > example volume icon and mute icon in one clicking once would mute/unmute, clicking and holding + moving up/down would change volume > > ! minimal_slider_widget___volumes https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9649385/21933351/fb86126c-d99c-11e6-8ffa-cd26d41b03b9.png > > another suggestion is to make the playlist icon thicker, with only 3 horizontal lines instead of 4. currently, it seems out of place with the other icons, too thin. not sure why it has to be similar to qt, apple not always makes the best decisions in ui design, we're just conditioned to think they do. > > finally, i would like that iina remembers where i dragged the osc the last time, between launches. in movist, i usually drag it to the top of the player so it doesn't cover my subtitles and i hate to position it every time i launch the app. from 97
