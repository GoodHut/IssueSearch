 URL : "https://github.com/cflint/CFLint/issues/301" TITLE : html outputs are broken BODY : ha - turns out that html output relies on findbugs xml - who'd have expected that it's being created that way... i just realised that today :-/ so - with me having brought the findbugs output over to the modern xsd they publish, the old xslt from findbugs xml to html is kind of useless now it's a template from 2004/5... . htmlstyle plain --- renders, but is useless htmlstyle default --- breaks, i have no idea why at this stage. will need to have a look at what our options are here.
