 URL : "https://github.com/Fody/AssertMessage/issues/6" TITLE : update to fody version 2 BODY : i was trying to update my fody add-in to use fody version 2 for jasonwoods-7/vandelay 2, but i'm using assertmessage in my project. i tried looking into doing a pr for assertmessage, but i wasn't sure how to update it since sequencepoint is no longer a member of the instruction object in the new mono.cecil.
