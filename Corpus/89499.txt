 URL : "https://github.com/johannhof/markdown.rs/issues/24" TITLE : question about code spans BODY : the markdown syntax i'm used to and the one used by github allows multi line code blocks with the tripple tick syntax. so something like this: fn main { println! codeblock ; } usually you can also specify the language after the three ticks. i only found tests for codeblocks using indentation. tripple tick code blocks would be nice to have.
