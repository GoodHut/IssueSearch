 URL : "https://github.com/CouncilDataProject/transcription_runner/issues/1" TITLE : create legistar version BODY : why this will help with not only expanding the project but also can be used as a model for other legistar city councils. how this shouldn't be too large of a project to take on. instead of a scraper function a data pull and formatting function that utilizes the targeted cities legistar api will be used. a single function change should be all that is required to make this work if done properly. potential changes ideally none to the core of the get_store_data.py functions, as this is hopefully a change to how the developer provides the scrapper function. worst case scenario is needing to change the get_video_feeds function in the get_store_data.py file to handle scrappers and api callers.
