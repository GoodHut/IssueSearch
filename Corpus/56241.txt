 URL : "https://github.com/Thutmose/ThutEssentials/issues/17" TITLE : missing: land command? BODY : hi thutmose, i'm using version 2.1.3 of thut essentials and which command i'm using from the section claiming thut.essentials.commands.land the server yells: unknown command. is the section claiming not implemented? i've tried to create a team via /createteam test . then i thought 'maybe missing permissions' and i added thut.essentials.commands.land.create to my group but i still encounter the same problem. kind regards
