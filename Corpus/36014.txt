 URL : "https://github.com/Persistent-SS13/Persistent-SS13/issues/16" TITLE : floor tile reversion BODY : problem description : floor tiles in certain locales revert to original paint scheme what did you expect to happen : used floor painter to clean up assembly line and gas turbine flooring of their rustiness. what happened instead : upon next shift all tiles reverted to their grimy old selves why is this bad/what are the consequences: even if an area is completely reworked, some tiles will not be changed. steps to reproduce the problem : floor painter in those two areas->shift end->new shift possibly related stuff : doesn't seem to affect any other tile type/area. assembly line is a persistent locale, not sure about gas turbine.
