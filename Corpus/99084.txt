 URL : "https://github.com/umustafi/pyd-visualization/issues/2" TITLE : make geocoding more robust BODY : currently, it only uses one fallback method if the address is not recognized by the first method. it could use more of the methods in the geocoder package before giving up. also, it needs some form of error handling in case the address fails to be geocoded, e.g. omit the city from the map.
