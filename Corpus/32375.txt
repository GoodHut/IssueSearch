 URL : "https://github.com/Keats/tera/issues/119" TITLE : update to serde 0.9 BODY : quite a few changes to do there: - to_value returns a result instead of a value but we can unwrap in most cases in tera, i don't think there is a place where we are using it that can fail - removal of value::{i64, u64, f64} for a value::number
