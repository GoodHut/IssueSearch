 URL : "https://github.com/RedTurtle/collective.editablemenu/issues/5" TITLE : missing features for 4 BODY : pr 4 works well, but there is no support for a feature previously present: multi-rows labels. in the current version, there is a textarea for the title, so it will be useful to keep it. i will probably try to implement this enhancing the pr, but i don't know if it needs changes in the backend calls.
