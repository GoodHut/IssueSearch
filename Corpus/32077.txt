 URL : "https://github.com/rdfhdt/hdt-java/issues/53" TITLE : too many open files BODY : when performing a hdt hdt = hdtmanager.mapindexedhdt rdffile.getabsolutepath , null ; and then do a hdt.close ; the number of open files keeps increasing. as i have 70.000 hdt files to query i have to run the program multiple times on subsets as otherwise i end up with too many open files in the os. i tried the 2.1 branch but was unable to compile the code.
