 URL : "https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/issues/3004" TITLE : near death escort behavior BODY : when an escort is near death it follows my movements and ignores everything else. which is the same behavior healthy escorts have when they don't have orders and there are no enemies around. this behavior is paramount to suicide mid-battle since they are priority targets but just stand there waiting for damage, making it very hard to protect them. i think they should actively try to stay near my ship while recovering circle me? and either run or face the enemy up to a certain distance from me . i tried messing with the ai but failed to understand how to change their behavior when they are near death too many behaviors are mixed in together .
