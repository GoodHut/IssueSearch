 URL : "https://github.com/vivekbhr/Subread_to_DEXSeq/issues/5" TITLE : -t argument, exonic_part BODY : through i saw a closed issue said the exonic_part should be added, i found the dexseq_prepare_annotation2.py does not work with that argument. there is no exonic_part in the dm6_ens76_flat.gtf at all, it only appears in the dm6_ens76_flat.gff am i right that the -t parameter should be deleted?
