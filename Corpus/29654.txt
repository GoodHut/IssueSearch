 URL : "https://github.com/jrsala/Peano/issues/1" TITLE : merging our efforts BODY : i have recently delved into the same topic as this project and written some functional templates on my own, although it has a few conceptional differences. https://github.com/heroickatora/functional-cpp-templates my own contributions to the topic are specifically using c++17 features to, for example, allow converting all the typename templates in the c++ standard to functions inside functional template language, providing a way for matching, and lambda-like function definitions. now i do not know whether or not you are interested, but i would really enjoy seeing you join the effort : if you would, feel free to join the discord server https://discord.gg/jayp79x
