 URL : "https://github.com/shama/on-load/issues/21" TITLE : nesting on-load calls BODY : it'd be neat if we could nest on-load calls. this is currently not working, but i think it should be possible. the problem is that nested mutationobserver events are incorrectly caught, which causes observer nesting to fail. unlike https://github.com/shama/on-load/pull/19 i suspect we can make this work without even with the currently globals e.g. the incrementing counter should help us here . cc/ @juliangruber see also - example test https://github.com/ahdinosaur/on-load/blob/199fc45a5f8328987df2c1bc39abd476d5655d43/test.js l293-l315 - pr attempt at implementing this https://github.com/shama/on-load/pull/19 - dat desktop pr discussing this https://github.com/datproject/dat-desktop/pull/329 discussion_r110834759
