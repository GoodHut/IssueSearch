 URL : "https://github.com/ark120202/aabs/issues/8" TITLE : rework talent system BODY : since in 1.8.0 we added all native talents, handling them all caused lags. talent system should be reworked to handle common and unique talents separately. - transfer all talents to kv format, to generate their changes with script - remove cost concept and replace it with points that can be received for each 5 levels. - all hero-unque talents should have only one level, as well as native ones - make new interface, designed to show difference between common and unique talents. - unique talents should be given on server, instead of having all of them on client.
