 URL : "https://github.com/elieserdejesus/JamTaba/issues/872" TITLE : jamtaba for android BODY : i understand the code is portable, but is it a pain to port jamtaba or a simplified version to android? i have a very nice android phone that's more powerful than my computer and it's capable of recognizing usb audio hardware using a small adapter. latency in android is very high even in new devices, but if you could have direct monitoring, that should not be a problem in the ninjam world if the latency is compensated. and you could use the same usb interface you use on the computer. pretty cool eh?
