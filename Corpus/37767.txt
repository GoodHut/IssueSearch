 URL : "https://github.com/Ralim/ts100/issues/79" TITLE : moskito bite shocker BODY : is there any way to get the temperature constantly to 51 degrees? because always when i fly my quads an moskito storm is incoming and i get like 5 bites in a minute.. moskito spray didn't work btw to prevent the moskito bites getting bigger, you need to apply heat to the bite..
and i remember one device which heats up to 51 degrees.. i think my english is brilliant Â¯\_ ãƒ„ _/Â¯ okay maybe if it's possible, make the temperature range from 50 to 450 degrees.. that would be great! ðŸ˜Š
