 URL : "https://github.com/dropseedlabs/config-loader/issues/10" TITLE : python 3.6 test in travis BODY : evidently 3.6 is not included in the base image yet, so you'd have to specify 3.6 as a python version you want but then 3.5 doesn't work . https://github.com/behave/behave-django/issues/32 we're not using tox in a very complicated way...basically the same as using this in .travis.yml ? yaml python: - 2.7 - 3.3 - 3.4 - 3.5 - 3.6 this may be a fine middle-ground if we want to keep using tox? https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tox-travis
