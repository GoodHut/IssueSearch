 URL : "https://github.com/heuels/briskhome/issues/29" TITLE : low code coverage BODY : this is a long-term task, more oriented at a release that will happen after the next one. currently the codebase is very poorly covered with unit tests. the coverage should be increased, each core component should be at least 85% covered only main files of the component are counted, specs and models do not . at the same time all components that are currently under heavy development these would be core.pki , core.sensors , core.notifications , etc. should already come unit tested.
