 URL : "https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager/issues/306" TITLE : is this behavior possible? BODY : hi, reading the docs i am not sure whether the following behaviour is possible at all. i would like to use this lib in a measurement device that has both an lcd display and mqtt logging capabilities. in the assumption that a valid set of credentials/parameters is already stored, i would like my device to: 1 try to connect to wifi without blocking for too long 2 if wifi is present, cycle normally, updating display and mqtt 3 if wifi is not available, cycle updating the display but skip mqtt 4 retry the wifi connection from time to time, possibly at a configurable interval 5 invoke the configuration portal only programmatically / from touch screen ui in the examples i see the autoconnect and the programmatic portal but i don't understand if the periodic connect attempt is feasible. thanks a lot for your time and apologies should the answer be an obvious one... but it is not to me!
