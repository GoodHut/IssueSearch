 URL : "https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/issues/9009" TITLE : php 7.2 support BODY : php 7.2 build on travis is already enabled and running, the very last issue we need to solve is https://github.com/jeremykendall/php-domain-parser/issues/205. after the stable package is released or we find another way around it , a patch release will be tagged. if you do need php 7.2 support right now, just require this package in 4.0.3-alpha version and everything should work just fine ðŸŽ‰
