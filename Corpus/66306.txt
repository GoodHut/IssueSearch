 URL : "https://github.com/dgraziotin/mbpfan/issues/117" TITLE : minor programming issue BODY : in main.c in check_requirements in two places opendir might be called without calling closedir . this only happens if coretemp and/or applesmc are built in but not modules. i believe you want to add closedir dir after the if enoent == errno block in two places. incidentally, is it not the case that the opendir ... check subsumes the popen lsmod|grep code? if so, you could eliminate a few redundant lines of code and use the faster code path which just does an opendir instead of a couple of fork /exec s. not that mbpfan is executed often enough for that to be a big deal. cheers.
