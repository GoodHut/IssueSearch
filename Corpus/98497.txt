 URL : "https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan/issues/146" TITLE : is class_exists supported? BODY : i have this code for optional dependency: php if class_exists '\composer\cabundle\cabundle' { curl_setopt $ch, curlopt_cainfo, \composer\cabundle\cabundle::getbundledcabundlepath ; } and phpstan is reporting: call to static method getbundledcabundlepath on an unknown class composer\cabundle\cabundle. is there problem with my code or is it just edge case that phpstan doesn't recognize?
