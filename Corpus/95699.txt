BODY : i realise this is not a tech support forum but.... just tried to hook up my rpi to the jspi1 header, flashrom was never able to recognise the eeprom. i reconnected and booted my pc and the monitor isnâ€™t turning on. i probably fucked up right? i made sure that the gpio pins were correctly wired and all.
