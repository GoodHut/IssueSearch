 URL : "https://github.com/Napster/napster.js/issues/8" TITLE : ommission in readme.txt BODY : i was following the readme file and kept hitting an error where the player object was null. while trying to get the example to run i saw that node.js was required. possibly this could be inferred by reading the package.json file but i failed that lesson the fist time also. after placing the package.json file in the root of my project and running 'npm install' it worked. might be nice to add this to the readme.txt file. ed
