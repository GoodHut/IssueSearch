 URL : "https://github.com/harlowja/fasteners/issues/28" TITLE : how to use this library? BODY : i was looking into the tests folder to try to find a code example i could work from, but it left me as baffled as the documentation. excerpted from class readwritelocktest in test_lock.py https://github.com/harlowja/fasteners/blob/master/fasteners/tests/test_lock.py l102 : def test_no_double_writers self : lock = fasteners.readerwriterlock a lock on what exactly? no filename is given watch = _utils.stopwatch duration=5 watch.start dups = collections.deque active = collections.deque def acquire_check me : with lock.write_lock : what does this with statement lock? neither in the documentation nor in the testing code is it very clear, how to use this readerwriterlock to lock access to a resource? a filename, nor any sort of context is ever given to these functions.
