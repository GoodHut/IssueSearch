 URL : "https://github.com/rurseekatze/OpenRailwayMap/issues/573" TITLE : computed timestamp wrong BODY : the website currently says 27.01.2017 18:36, more than 1 hour ago in my chromium it's 18:57 . from a quick glance at the code it should show some minutes. i suspect it is a timezone thing utc+1 .
