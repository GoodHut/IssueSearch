 URL : "https://github.com/Galooshi/import-js/issues/463" TITLE : import gets not added BODY : hi! thanks for making this great tool! i found that there is happening something strange. i made a test repo: https://github.com/tujoworker/import-js-bug bash git clone https://github.com/tujoworker/import-js-bug cd import-js-bug npm install i use atom editor with the package import-js installed. once i try to index the sqlite database with the dependencies, noting than the index.js gets added. but once i go into ./node_modules/react-anime/package.json and change: json main : dist/anime.min.js , to without .min main : dist/anime.js , ... and i rerun the process to index the database, 'react-anime' gets added. unfortunately with the name 'reactanime' where is this coming from? . i would be happy if someone knows why the .min version is not supported. cordial, tobias
