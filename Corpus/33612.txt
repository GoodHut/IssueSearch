 URL : "https://github.com/datacamp/RDocumentation-app/issues/299" TITLE : address broken links BODY : some older versions of packages contain external links that are no longer live. if there was a way to preemptively disable those, or tell the user that they are disabled, that would be nice. this either requires engineering on the server-side which causes a slowdown or engineering on the client-side which causes google to not see the links . not a huge priority. cc @dwaynemartin @martijnsublime
