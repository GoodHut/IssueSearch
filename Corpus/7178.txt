 URL : "https://github.com/react-bootstrap-table/react-bootstrap-table2/issues/80" TITLE : edit entire row BODY : hi @allenfang, i was wondering why i don't see a edit row option, only edit single cells. am i missing something? do you think that would be useful? as default implementation a simple modal holding the current row field values, opened with a edit button in the toolbar, would work fine and should easy to implement. any tips on how to implement it in the current react-bootstrap-table version? thanks, and keep up with the awesome work! üëç
