 URL : "https://github.com/aspnetboilerplate/aspnetboilerplate/issues/2302" TITLE : swagger & abpauthorize BODY : hi, i'm trying to find information on how to make the swagger integration include authorization info so that: generated clients automatically know about having to send the bearer token in the header the live documentation mentions for each call whether it needs authentication and if so, which permissions are required. i looked at https://github.com/domaindrivendev/swashbuckle.aspnetcore add-security-definitions-and-requirements, but if i understand the code correctly, it relies on the presence of attributes on controllers. now in aspboilerplate, i do not write controllers, but appservices, so relying on controller attributes cannot yield the necessary information. any pointers to documentation or a sample about this? many thanks, max
