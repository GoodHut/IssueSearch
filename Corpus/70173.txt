 URL : "https://github.com/JonasProgrammer/arduino-cmake/issues/9" TITLE : usb vid and pid for cdc BODY : i would like to implement custom vid and pid for usb cdc. i need this for the udev rules to distinguish multiple arduino leonardo connected to my robotics system. the other option is to properly implemented the iserial of the cdc, but that requires chances in the source code of arduino core which i think is more difficult. basically this involve adding some if statement in here https://github.com/jonasprogrammer/arduino-cmake/blob/master/cmake/platform/arduino.cmake l2275 . and maybe add a pid and vid argument in generate_arduino_firmware . i think i have an idea how to do this, just want to make sure that you think this is useful before i start to work on this.
