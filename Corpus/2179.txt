 URL : "https://github.com/rwieruch/the-road-to-learn-react/issues/43" TITLE : typo i think BODY : excellent book, thanks very much for putting this together. i'm working through it and on page 84/85 where you deal with the pagination / hacker news api the book mentions the following code: <div classname= interactions >getting real with an api <button onclick={ => this.fetchsearchtopstories searchterm, page + 1\ }> more </button> </div> i was getting an error here, i think due to the \ after the page variable is increased by 1. i.e. should be: <button onclick={ => this.fetchsearchtopstories searchterm, page + 1 }> if i am indeed correct, i hope that helps someone.
