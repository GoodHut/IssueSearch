 URL : "https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/issues/2569" TITLE : ssh map fields BODY : hopefully this is a simple lack of understanding but read every doc i can find and seem to be missing something fundamental or there is a bug so either way hopefully asking a stupid question will help someone else in future making the same mistake. im trying to ultimately create a ssh user signed key with the permit-pty extention. but i'm failing to understand how you pass a map string. the closest i have got is: vault write ssh-client-signer/roles/clientrole @data.json data.json { allow_bare_domains : false, allow_host_certificates : false, allow_subdomains : false, allow_user_certificates : true, allow_user_key_ids : false, allowed_critical_options : , allowed_domains : , allowed_extensions : , allowed_users : , default_critical_options : {}, default_extensions : { permit-pty : } , default_user : , key_type : ca , max_ttl : 768h0m0s , ttl : 5m0s } which seems to work not quite happy with the the fact i have to pass key : to something that never holds a value but maybe there is a better way. but is there a way to pass map values in via the cli without resorting to external json. vault write ssh-client-signer/roles/clientrole allow_user_certificates=true ttl=5m key_type=ca default_extensions= { permit-x11-forwarding : } i get back error converting input { permit-x11-forwarding : } for field default_extensions: '' expected a map, got 'string' escaping the in various ways seems to make no difference. what am i missing as can find no examples in any of the docs to parsing map values via the cli. or is it just not possible? also is the above structure correct. my experience tells me it should be of the form below but that errors and im new to go and no json expert. permit-pty , permit-x11-forwarding , ....
