 URL : "https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1332" TITLE : proposal: usage metrics BODY : enterprise customer feedback metrics useful for tracking service usage roughly in order of importance : sessions established, broken out per user authentication success/failures to auth server, broken out by user the interactive login portion, local auth/saml ssh authentication success/failures from user to teleport proxy since service initialization, broken out per user ssh authentication success/failures from teleport proxy to upstream target if in interception mode , broken out per user operational service metrics: amount of bytes transited through proxy, broken out by flow direction e.g. inbound/outbound; shouldn't be as simple as sent/received since proxies generally send and receive every byte counter metrics should be represented as a simple count since the service was initialized. rate metrics should be exposed as per second over a rolling window of x minutes.
