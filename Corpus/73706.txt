 URL : "https://github.com/DocNow/diffengine/issues/40" TITLE : dealing with url changes BODY : i'm setting up a tracker for http://visir.is a icelandic news site . i've noticed that when changes are done on headlines, their system makes new urls. the urls are made up of these elements: http://visir.is/g/<article_id>/<headline> to view the article the <headline> part is reduntant. to get around it i made some changes to allow for a regex to be applied to a url from the rss feed. see here: https://github.com/pallih/diffengine/commit/0519f3114e0aebbb4c428152a1fa3894d6c9c769 this makes the url checked: http://visir.is/g/<article_id> so subsequent changes to the headline are picked up, and not stored as a new article. i'm not sure introducing a config variable is appropriate for the project, but at least my solution is there, if anyone needs it.
