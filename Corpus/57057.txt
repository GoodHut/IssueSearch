 URL : "https://github.com/rtshome/pgrepup/issues/11" TITLE : pgrepup fix suggestion BODY : i had no primary key on some tables. so pgrepup fix fixed it by adding another column with __pgrepup_id__ or some similar name. thats really a not very good idea to alter db's without explaining to user, what is going to be altered. in my case, this alteration would broke our deploy process. what did helped me, id adding a primary key to the tables itself. alter table alembic_version add primary key version_num ; that helped.
