 URL : "https://github.com/rwtema/extrautilities/issues/1710" TITLE : block description issues BODY : in the latest 1.7.10 version, 1.2.12, compressed dirt has the description '9 tile.dirt.name'. this is the same for double, triple and quadruple compressed dirt, with 9 being replaced with the correct amount of dirt for each block. compressed and double compressed sand have the same issue. cobblestone and gravel are fine. any fixes?
