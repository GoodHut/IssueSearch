BODY : the card the a.i. struggles with the most is doomsayer. it seems to pay no attention to this minion either on its side or its opponents and will happily play minions that are doomed. something like a don't play minions that aren't totems , with no deathrattle or jade effect if an opposing doomsayer is staying in play this turn. is i think a start.
