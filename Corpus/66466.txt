 URL : "https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-rfcs/issues/84" TITLE : move away from tooltool BODY : context: we have some jobs called toolchain jobs , that are responsible to build the basic tools to compile gecko, and more. these jobs build a third party software and make the binary tar ball available as an artifact. when a new toolchain job is created,, a gecko developer must manually download the artifact, upload it to tooltool and modify the relevant manifest files. we can do better than this by doing something similar we did for docker images: based on in-tree config contents, we can say if we need a new build or not, and basing the task id on contents hash value, make the gecko jobs download directly from artifacts. or better yet, automatically put them inside the docker container and save some network resources. notice this doesn't apply only for toolchains, it can be anything that follow this pattern.
