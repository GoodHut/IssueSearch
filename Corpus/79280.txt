 URL : "https://github.com/ZencashOfficial/zen/issues/86" TITLE : securenode memory usage. BODY : i initially posted this in the secnodetracker https://github.com/zencashofficial/secnodetracker/issues/6 github but was asked to post it here instead. i have a 2gb linode with 4gb of swap and i kept getting exceptions so when i checked and zend was using a massive amount of memory ram & swap whilst it was just sitting there idle. ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7847340/32561996-81cfb802-c4a5-11e7-8a64-d98b7cd4c050.png i restarted zend but when it came back up it was using the same amount of memory. i then stopped both zend and the tracker then started them in the same order and now the memory useage is back to an acceptable level ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7847340/32547021-c4113d6c-c478-11e7-9a9c-aac868c2fd82.png so when the next challenge was run the memory usage jumped back up as expected but stayed there long after the challenge finished. ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7847340/32562175-e55f5d46-c4a5-11e7-914e-83cfff4eaca7.png ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7847340/32562194-ece3d844-c4a5-11e7-8f67-129e9c0f6663.png this is my node on the tracking https://securenodes.eu.zensystem.io/nodes/262/detail site, both the wallet and tracking software are the latest version zen: 2001050 tracker: 0.0.8 . i'm waiting for the next challenge to see if it happens again, i'll update here when it does..
