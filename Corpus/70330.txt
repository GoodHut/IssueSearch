 URL : "https://github.com/test-kitchen/kitchen-vagrant/issues/297" TITLE : vagrant hyper-v support BODY : i know that there's a separate hyper-v plugin for test kitchen, but now that vagrant supports hyper-v as a virtualization provider out of the box https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/hyperv/ , should we be able to use hyper-v vagrant boxes with this plugin? i'm exploring the option now, but it seems broken on virtual-switch selection. i'll do up a full report if this is something we're interested in supporting via this plugin.
