 URL : "https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd/issues/1613" TITLE : grpc memory leak BODY : refer to https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd/pull/1598 issuecomment-323488710. it looks like @adleong's commit 9deb5f7 revealed a memory leak in long-running grpc streams. this leak was probably already there, but wasn't being reached because the flow-control issue fixed in 9deb5f7 was preventing us from reaching a state in which it could occur. @klingerf did some investigation of a heap dump see https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd/pull/1598 issuecomment-325006851 and it looks like unbounded asyncqueue creation might be the cause of this leak. i talked it over w/ alex & we suspect that long streams probably cause a future chain that gets longer and longer, probably in streamproxy or bufferedstream .
