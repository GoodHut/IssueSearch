 URL : "https://github.com/CasparCG/Server/issues/583" TITLE : dynamic color layer BODY : i alreday posted this in the forum, but here is probably the better place. i played around with the new scene producer for a while. a little thing, that i noticed is missing or i did not found it is: an easy way to set the color of a layer dynamicaly. there are functions to modify hue saturation and brightness, so it could be done somehow, but nice would be a way to set the color from a hex argb-value.
