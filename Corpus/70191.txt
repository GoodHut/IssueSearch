 URL : "https://github.com/FausticSun/addressbook-level2/issues/5" TITLE : use class-level members BODY : note how some of the variables and methods are declared static . that means they are class-level members rather than instance-level members.<br> e.g.<br> main.version , name.example , utils.isanynull ... exercise: add class-level members convert the parser::parsecommand ... method i.e. the parsecommand method of the parser class to a class-level method. note how this method can be either class-level or instance-level. note how the settags method of the person class cannot be converted to a class-level method. add an instance-level member int sequencenumber and a class-level variable int nextsequencenumber to the person class. using these two variables, ensure that each person object has a unique sequence number that indicates the order in which person objects were created. e.g. adam is the first person object to be created. it is assigned sequence number 1. ben and charlie are created next, and assigned 2 and 3 respectively. ben is deleted. daisy is added next and is given sequence number 4.
