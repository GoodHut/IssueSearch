 URL : "https://github.com/github/gh-ost/issues/492" TITLE : --help going to stderr BODY : this is a minor quibble, but gh-ost --help sends its output to stderr. is that an intentional decision? it's a bummer for me because i keep having to remember the 2>&1 syntax just to pipe it to less or grep you would think after all these years i would have it memorized, but i don't . if i get some :+1: to move to stdout, i'll take a stab at a pr. but i wanted to ask first.
