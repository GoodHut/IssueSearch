 URL : "https://github.com/dylbnks/prj-rev-bwfs-dasmoto/issues/4" TITLE : avoid absolute links BODY : all links to files/images in html are broken on any machine other than yours. that's because it's an absolute link full link path that relates to your specific file structure . technically it's close to a relative link, but your project directory only starts at ../resources/ and anything before that folder isn't in the path. we want to use relative links which doesn't specify the whole path so that the file will be accessible on any machine. something similar to this: <link href= ./resources/style.css type= text/css rel= stylesheet > https://github.com/dylbnks/prj-rev-bwfs-dasmoto/blob/master/dasmoto's%20arts%20and%20crafts/index.html l4
