 URL : "https://github.com/whuang08/ROPTLIB/issues/6" TITLE : dependency on fftw BODY : hi! i would like to point out that after the inclusion of fftw in roptlib, this has become a necessary dependency that may make the compilation fail if not installed. for those who may have this issue, i wanted to share that in ubuntu 14.04 and i guess for more recent versions as well you need to install: sudo apt-get install libfftw3-3 libfftw3-dev it is important to install the -dev package as well, otherwise the symbolic link libfftw3.so is not created. you may want to indicate this in some kind of dependencies section in the readme : best, - jesus
