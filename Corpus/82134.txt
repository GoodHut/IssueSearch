 URL : "https://github.com/mikesir87/bacabs/issues/16" TITLE : add healthcheck listening BODY : update the event watcher to listen to health_status events. it should publish an event into redis for a health status change, which will then update the appropriate deployment. the same set of event filters should be used for listening. this obviously requires a container to be using the healthcheck directive when the image is built. documentation should be updated to reflect that.
