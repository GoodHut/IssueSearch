 URL : "https://github.com/HackIllinois/api-2017/issues/105" TITLE : clean up: beginner BODY : there are several things that are good things for beginners looking to get used to the codebase to undertake. - replace the find->then->ifnotnull->create promise pattern when saving new data by using the database response to determine if a model exists - standardize endpoint names and conventions - get /all for getting all, etc - move config-like utils into config - refactor the events model - reduce stats inner queries to joins
