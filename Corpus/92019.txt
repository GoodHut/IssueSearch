 URL : "https://github.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/issues/126" TITLE : used ports for tar pakage BODY : hi, i've created a verdaccio setup that seems to work for most pakages, when the firewall allows any to any. i've added our proxy to npm set http_proxy=http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:3128 npm config set proxy %http_proxy% npm config set https-proxy %http_proxy% when i add the default port for verdaccio to the firewall, then most pakages are getting loaded. but e.g. the npm install tar is not working there i get a error 500 because it gets blocked from our firewall but when i try to install it without verdaccio only with npm registry, then i can install it without any problems. is verdaccio using some special ports or how could that happen?
