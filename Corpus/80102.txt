 URL : "https://github.com/dperini/nwmatcher/issues/104" TITLE : tag for 1.4.1 is missing BODY : the tag for 1.4.1, which is the latest release at the time of writing, is missing. among problems this causes: cdnjs https://cdnjs.com/libraries/nwmatcher does not yet publish 1.4.1 because it is set to detect new versions of nwmatcher through git, which means it looks for tags and uses that.
