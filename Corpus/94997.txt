 URL : "https://github.com/fastify/fastify/issues/76" TITLE : confusing payload/body api BODY : js const route = { method: 'post', path: '/foo', handler: req, reply => { reply.send {bar: req.body.bar} }, schema: { payload: { type: 'object', properties: { bar: {type: 'string'} } } } } notice that the validation schema for the post body is labeled payload , whereas within the handler method it is referenced as body . this mix of terminology is confusing, particularly for someone used to using hapi. either the validation config should change payload to body , or the handler should be passed req.payload .
