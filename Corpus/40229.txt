 URL : "https://github.com/es-shims/Promise.prototype.finally/issues/5" TITLE : this._c is undefined BODY : this might be related to 4 as it only happens with firefox, but i couldn't figure out the root cause and i don't have a minimal example. setup: promise = ...fetch ... promisefinally promise, => ... now at some point we hit this._c is undefined in this line: https://github.com/zloirock/core-js/blob/0bb657cfc7834d03fd68c48a1cba70f2ccab20c0/modules/es6.promise.js l212 this is window when the error happens, which is obviously wrong. so something seems to be wrongly bound there. i'm not even sure this is an issue with this library, but it goes away when i switch to es6-promise.
