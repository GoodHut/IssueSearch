 URL : "https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/openssh-formula/issues/102" TITLE : deprecated sshd options BODY : i am using this formula to manage openssh in small home environment, and while applying some states i came across deprecation warnings in the sshd logs of a fedora 26 minion: $ journalctl -u sshd jul 22 12:51:24 systemd 1 : starting openssh server daemon... jul 22 12:51:24 sshd 12040 : /etc/ssh/sshd_config line 23: deprecated option useprivilegeseparation jul 22 12:51:24 sshd 12040 : /etc/ssh/sshd_config line 26: deprecated option keyregenerationinterval jul 22 12:51:24 sshd 12040 : /etc/ssh/sshd_config line 27: deprecated option serverkeybits jul 22 12:51:24 sshd 12040 : /etc/ssh/sshd_config line 45: deprecated option rsaauthentication jul 22 12:51:24 sshd 12040 : /etc/ssh/sshd_config line 54: deprecated option rhostsrsaauthentication jul 22 12:51:24 sshd 12040 : could not load host key: /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key jul 22 12:51:24 sshd 12040 : server listening on 0.0.0.0 port 22. jul 22 12:51:24 sshd 12040 : server listening on :: port 22. jul 22 12:51:24 systemd 1 : started openssh server daemon. i don't have the deprecated options specified in pillar. i did a little research and it seems to be that these options were removed from the sshd_config file in recent versions of openssh 7, in preparation of removing support for ssh protocol 1. this makes sense as fedora 26 uses version 7.5 of openssh and i don't get these warnings when running the state on centos 7.3 systems which are using version 6.6 of openssh. this isn't a major issue as nothing is broken of course, but i thought it might be a good idea to bring it up.
