 URL : "https://github.com/Im-dex/xray-162/issues/16" TITLE : recent rendering changes? BODY : hi, first of all, just want to say it again: this repo is pure gold. i love the work you're doing here. i'm using this repo to build my mod radium on if that's cool with you. anyway, after the march 20th commits i can no longer build a directx 11.3 device without error messages popping up in relation to dxgi1_1.h which i'm still trying to figure out. to get to the point, some of these commits are enormous, can you give me a breakdown on any rendering changes you've made so i know where to troubleshoot?
