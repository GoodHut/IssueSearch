 URL : "https://github.com/Fornoth/spotify-connect-web/issues/128" TITLE : install without docker ? BODY : hey. sorry for asking this question here, but i am desperate. i am trying since days to get this running on raspberry pi zero, and all works fine, but no lastfm. i realized, it was because i installed the packaged release, and this one is old. now i tried for hours to copy newer files over and manually installing the requirements and so on. no luck. flask cors missing even though installed , google, nothing useable. please please please if someone would be kind enough to push a new packaged release that can be installed with the spotify-connect-web.sh. please, i could donate a few $. thanks, and sorry, i know this is not the place.
