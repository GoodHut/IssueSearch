 URL : "https://github.com/trizen/trizen/issues/21" TITLE : pacman long options BODY : what about adding support for pacman long options? this command tries to install the package instead of search for it because '--search' is not supported by trizen, and it ignores it : trizen -s --search <package name> it gives a warning: ! invalid option <<--search>> i have two ideas to solve this issue: - trizen should give all unsupported options e. g. '--search' to pacman, and if an option isn't supported by pacman, it exits. - make an array, that contains the long pacman options, that are not supported by trizen adding them to %lconfig not needed , but pacman understands them.
