 URL : "https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/issues/4822" TITLE : less compiled into modules BODY : i used a library called react-toolbox prior to antd, and while i love antd graphics and components, there is one thing i havent been able to figure out yet. the way less files are compiled, all styles remain global and can be used anywhere, where as the previos library, i believe takes advantage of css-loader ability to compile and modularize. example, on my previous library if i loaded the <button> component, it would result in something like this: <button disabled= class= theme__button___1ikuo theme__raised___onzv6 theme__primary___2nhn1 type= button data-react-toolbox= button > and the corresponding css would look something like this: disabled .theme__flat___2ui7t, disabled .theme__floating___1mz5e, disabled .theme__raised___onzv6, disabled .theme__toggle___1zy-o { ... } and then any custom styles i could assign by importing styles into an object and assigning this into elements, something like: import styles from 'forms.scss'; ....<div classname={styles.formbox}... in any case, all im asking is if there is a way to make antd work this way. i spent a couple of hours already and so far i havent been able to make this work. i've played with the css-loader/less-loader settings in my webpack config to no avail. any ideas ?
