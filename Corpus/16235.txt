 URL : "https://github.com/bwapi/bwapi/issues/713" TITLE : idea for a plugin BODY : i had an idea for a plugin to help practice the keyboard shortcuts in starcraft. the plugin is very simple in purpose: every time you click on an order button in the bottom-right panel, a small box around 100x100 pixels with the letter of the corresponding hotkey would blink for a fraction of a second in the middle of the screen. is bwapi the tool for the job? thanks!
