 URL : "https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-epub3/issues/86" TITLE : make byline optional BODY : i'm writing a software development book and don't need the byline at the top of each section. hiding it with the following css code doesn't seem to work on all readers. it would be great, if the byline would be optional so that it doesn't get generated, if i don't need it. .chapter-header p.byline { display: none; }
