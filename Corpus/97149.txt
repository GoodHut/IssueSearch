 URL : "https://github.com/zzzprojects/html-agility-pack/issues/74" TITLE : follow semantic versioning BODY : looking at the history/changes between v1.5.1 and v1.5.6-beta2 https://github.com/zzzprojects/html-agility-pack/compare/v1.5.1...v1.5.6-beta2 , it seems that there have been bug fixes _and_ enhancements like in 3b96a9ec20c55591e411844210ee03c9937eefcc and f99b05a979434c9b054bea04ebcf98f488969cde yet only the patch version has been incremented in all cases. conventionally, the patch version should be incremented for backward compatible bug fixes and the minor version incremented for enhancements. if someone takes a dependency on htmlagilitypack, it's important to be able to assess if a release or upgrade is expected to be a pure patch or not. the project should follow semantic versioning http://semver.org/spec/v1.0.0.html for all the various reasons listed in the semantic versioning specification http://semver.org/spec/v1.0.0.html why-use-semantic-versioning .
