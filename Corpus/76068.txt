 URL : "https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/issues/218" TITLE : inconsistent url parsing BODY : operating system: osx sierra node version: 8.2.1 npm version: 5.4.2 webpack version: 3.4.1 webpack-dev-middleware version: 1.12.0 - this is a feature request - x this is a bug https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/blob/441335c8d09d78675317d986b789bb7e73311a88/lib/getfilenamefromurl.js l9-l10 the above urlparse calls are inconscients two more arguments and produce different results for at least one case i stumbled upon. the use case i'm talking about is when both 'publicpath' and 'url' are a string with a value of '//localhost:9090/static/client/' with the argument above the resulting value for 'localprefix' is json { protocol : null, slashes : true, auth : null, host : localhost:9090 , port : 9090 , hostname : localhost , hash : null, search : null, query : null, pathname : /static/client/ , path : /static/client/ , href : //localhost:9090/static/client/ } and for 'urlobject' json { protocol : null, slashes : null, auth : null, host : null, port : null, hostname : null, hash : null, search : null, query : null, pathname : //localhost:9090/static/client/ , path : //localhost:9090/static/client/ , href : //localhost:9090/static/client/ } a quick look at the two results shows that parsing isn't consistent. this makes a false positive in the condition below https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/blob/441335c8d09d78675317d986b789bb7e73311a88/lib/getfilenamefromurl.js l13-l16 expected behavior urlparse invoking should be consistent i think for bugs; how can we reproduce the behavior? just set a breakpoint in the mentioned lines and call both of them with '//localhost:9090/static/client/'
