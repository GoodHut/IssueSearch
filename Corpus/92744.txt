 URL : "https://github.com/InteractiveMechanics/CollegeWomen_Drupal7/issues/42" TITLE : 24 13: data export feature BODY : our suggestion: select the range of a data set run a faceted search, results page would have export button all data from your search returned or, if all results, export everything formats for export: json, csv, txt we said we can come up with a streamlined version of the option we originally suggested. we can install the module and set it up at a basic level. instead of allowing the user to select a subset of data, they'd download everything. we could then add on specific exporting features in the future if you want. @mtedeschi can you revise this description to include what candace will need to create this feature the way you envision it?
