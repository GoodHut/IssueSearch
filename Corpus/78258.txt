 URL : "https://github.com/griffithlab/regtools/issues/79" TITLE : possible features to add BODY : thanks again for developing this usefull and much needed tool! some features you could add to make it even more usefull in my opinion are: 1. support for multi-sample splice-junction calling with multiple bam files as input. either directly through ´junctions extract´or by adding a command to merge multiple junction bed files. 2. support for custom annotations in ´junctions annotate´ from gtf files. e.g. adding a flag which information to annotate from the gtf. 3. support for custom annotations in ´junctions annotate´ from bed files. this functionality would allow the use of population controll datasets like intropolis https://github.com/nellore/intropolis/ . 4. add functionality to normalize the junction counts to the surrounding junctions and/or the coverage of the neigboring exons. some thoughts on this topic can be found here: https://macarthurlab.org/2017/05/31/improving-genetic-diagnosis-in-mendelian-disease-with-transcriptome-sequencing-a-walk-through/. these features would greatly improve the reach and utility of regtools!
