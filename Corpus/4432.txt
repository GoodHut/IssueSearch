BODY : my vision for the core use case for did:btcr is at https://github.com/w3c/vc-use-cases/issues/31 â€” i encourage everyone to read it. i'd also love to continue to work with @jandrieu on moving the use case forward toward his full 15-step model that he did for jorum during our hackathon if he is up for it. maybe natalie could help? @kimdhamilton?
