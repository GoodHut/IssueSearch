 URL : "https://github.com/fluxoft/rebar/issues/69" TITLE : db class method visibility BODY : change mapper::getmodelset and mapper::getmodel to have protected visibility so they can be used in child classes. also change model::isvalid to look for a lower-case validate instead of upper case, for style consistency these methods should be declared as protected functions in child classes
