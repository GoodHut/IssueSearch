 URL : "https://github.com/me-no-dev/EspExceptionDecoder/issues/24" TITLE : not supported on esp32 BODY : i started with wifi on esp32. the libraries are probably mixed up with standard arduino wifi.h. i got an exception on core 1 error and tried this promising tool. after starting it tells me not supported on esp32. i use arduino ide 1.8.3. restart of the ide or compiling/upload the sketch again didn't fix it. thank you for your support!
