 URL : "https://github.com/tests-always-included/metalsmith-data-loader/issues/7" TITLE : never resolved data path BODY : i tried to include a .yaml file outside of the src directory and set the directory: to every conceivable value using both the default models and my own custom directory name data 'models' expected to work 'models/' '/models/' './models' './models/' and i tried not setting the directory at all... i also included the data: !items.yaml inside the front matter of the file to point to the directory outside of src not only did it not load any data, it also ate the other front-matter on that page e.g. layout: my-layout.html so... no dice. i'm not willing to struggle this hard for this unless you know what is going on. in the meantime i'm going back to using metalsmith-metadata which just works. however, i would still prefer to keep my data outside of my src directory. thoughts?
