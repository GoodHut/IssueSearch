 URL : "https://github.com/ClockSelect/myevic/issues/264" TITLE : new management tool BODY : hi all, i'm writing a new management tool for our preferred boxes. it is written in c and do not depend on third part library it uses my own system, see here if you are interested: dynalib demo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzio2zztk-e and here dynalib http://www.dynadream.com/ddweb/index.php/technology . it is a little old demo and of course a lots changed since then . it is also multiplatform and uses hid to access/manipulate device's data. you can see a little preview of it here: evicmanager https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckwf42x4cc8&feature=youtu.be the interface is very poor at the moment as i'm still trying to figure out how to get the hid interface working. as you can see i'm at the data grabbing stage and so far by looking and sometime changing the myevic source code i was able to understand how the data are stored and how to get them. but i found some problems and i'm asking the dev @clockselect some questions: 1 i found that the hid_cmd_monitoring report 'strange' data as you can see in the video above that do not match the ones i read using the vcom interface. looking at the code i found that the returned data are treated somewhat different maybe for a particular reason . it is incomplete or they are meant for some other usage? 2 i can't get the hid_cmd_setparams to work that is the most important part for the tool . the command run through the system well but reaching the hidgetoutreport function, at the hid_cmd_setparams case, the hiddfdata do not match the data i passed bytes are all 0 . i write to the hid by using the correct offset and size respectively sizeof uint8_t to offset from the checksum bytes and dataflash_params_size along with the new parameters data. i do this by sending first the command and then write the data. any hints? thank you for the great work on myevic! box model: evic vtc mini coil setup:
