 URL : "https://github.com/tonyhffong/Lint.jl/issues/193" TITLE : extended linter message BODY : cf. discourse https://discourse.julialang.org/t/ann-linter-julia-plugin-for-atom-juno/2118/24 a useful feature that i'd love is a + button in atom.io that extends the box with the linter message which gives more information, e.g. how to silence a warning or even a button that automatically adds a @lintpragma to silence the warning for you @terofrondelius > this is already implemented in linter, thus it would be as simple as starting to use the feature. now the tricky part, which i don't have a glue at the moment, what should we write to the hint box? how to get that information? i propose that you will file an issue to lint.jl, because linter is already supporting to display it, thus we will need to find the way to provide that information
