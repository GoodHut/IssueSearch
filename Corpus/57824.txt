 URL : "https://github.com/grahamgilchrist/hotac-squad-builder/issues/42" TITLE : remove non-basic ships BODY : for now, the app should just provide the basic hotac ships, since there is no standard for the other ships, and players who don't know the ships/system do not know that they should't choose newer ships
