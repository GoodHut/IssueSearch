 URL : "https://github.com/WiFiBeat/WiFiBeat/issues/1" TITLE : improve logging class BODY : logging is currently done using a blocking syslog call to log on the console and/or syslog. improve this class to log to the console, a file and/or syslog. it would also need to use a thread so adding logs doesn't block any operation, a simple call to a method would add a message to the queue https://github.com/cameron314/concurrentqueue and later on processed by the thread. it might be worth it to create a separate header-only library for this.
