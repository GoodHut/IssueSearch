 URL : "https://github.com/hebcal/hebcal-js/issues/43" TITLE : google apps script BODY : please forgive my ignorance -- i'm familiar with programming in general, but know very little about js. i'm trying to create a function in google sheets that will convert hebrew and gregorian dates using this library. i imported the client side script into google apps script and created a function, but quickly realized that scripts meant for a browser will not play well in gas e.g. window, setinterval, etc. , which runs the script on google's servers i think . i get the feeling i'm going about this the wrong way - should i be using the node version? i'm a little lost on how that works... if anyone is able to help, i'd greatly appreciate it. thanks!
