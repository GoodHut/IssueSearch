 URL : "https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile/issues/494" TITLE : esp8266 nodemcu makefile BODY : i added functionality to the arduino ide to compile and upload to an esp8266 dev board. its becoming very popular and i have a few projects that i will be using it with. it all works fine in the ide. i have tried to get this working with the arduino-makefile which work great with all my arduino sketches, but no luck with the esp8266. is it possible to get this to work? i am not strong with make so i have been doing some guess work without much success. this is the board manager used to install the esp8266 board http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json module i am using is “nodemcu 1.0 esp-12e module ” thanks
