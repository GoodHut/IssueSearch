 URL : "https://github.com/codepoetpbowden/ConnectedLivingSpace/issues/89" TITLE : mod not appearing in ckan BODY : believe this is because the netkan file in https://github.com/ksp-ckan/netkan uses a $kref to spacedock, and the spacedock file shows 1.3.0 as the latest version supported. if you either override the version, or point it to github and add a .version here, it should reappear for those using 1.3.1. @papajoessoup i'll be happy to submit a pull to add the version info here and one to ckan to change the $kref is there any reason this won't work with 1.3.1?
