 URL : "https://github.com/hyperhq/runv/issues/573" TITLE : runv start failed BODY : hi, i followed the instruction of readme: https://github.com/hyperhq/runv run. build the latest runv code, and install kernel and initrd by install hyperstart rpm: sudo rpm -ivh https://hypercontainer-download.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/0.8/centos/hyperstart-0.8.1-1.el7.centos.x86_64.rpm but runv cannot start as readme demonstrated: $sudo ./runv --kernel /var/lib/hyper/kernel --initrd /var/lib/hyper/hyper-initrd.img name: runv - open container initiative hypervisor-based runtime runv is a command line client for running applications packaged according to the open container format ocf and is a compliant implementation of the open container initiative specification. however, due to the difference between hypervisors and containers, the following sections of ocf don't apply to runv: namespace capability device linux and mount fields in oci specs are ignored ... the runv even didn't give any error message, did i missed something? or binary mismatch issue? it also weird that hyperstart rpm and hyper-container rpm both don't included runv binary, why not let runv included in hyperstart rpm? great thanks.
