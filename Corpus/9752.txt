 URL : "https://github.com/mozilla/nsf-challenge/issues/31" TITLE : add csp meta tag BODY : we've been asked to add a content security policy for the site. unfortunately, cloudfront and s3 don't let us add headers to requests, so we're going to have to use a <meta> tag. here's what the tag should be: html <meta http-equiv= content-security-policy content= default-src 'none'; font-src https://code.cdn.mozilla.net; img-src 'self'; script-src 'self' > this should be the first tag in the <head> section of every html file we generate.
