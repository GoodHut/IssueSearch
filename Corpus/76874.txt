 URL : "https://github.com/Tyrrrz/LightBulb/issues/48" TITLE : manually set geolocation BODY : i recently switched from f.lux after discovering that it has started collecting usage data and it was made opt-out and am glad to have found lightbulb. one feature that i always used on f.lux is a custom geolocation - i work nights so standard sunrise/sunset times don't work well for my body clock. i used to set the geolocation as somewhere across the other side of the world. i'd be grateful if this could be added as a feature, thanks!
