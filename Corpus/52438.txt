 URL : "https://github.com/cocos-creator/engine/issues/1841" TITLE : cocos creator on linux BODY : this is a feature request. have you guys thought about porting the client to linux? i mean since it's an electron app it should be really straight forward. also, a lot of the js community loves and uses linux anyways, so i really don't see why not. also, pretty much everything in cocos is cross-platform, so i really don't understand why there isn't a port.
