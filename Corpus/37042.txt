 URL : "https://github.com/CactusDev/CactusBot/issues/195" TITLE : issues with repeats. BODY : i seem to be having no success with getting repeats working on my channel http://kondrik.com/stream?ghi . when i tell the bot to add a repeat, it says it's added, but then doesn't list it. if i try to re-add/edit the repeat i already added, the bot doesn't respond. and if i try to remove the repeat, the bot says it doesn't exist. ! screenshot1 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/151580904177795073/270942981136187393/repeats.png ! screenshot2 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/151580904177795073/270525982576869376/cb-repeat_bug.png
