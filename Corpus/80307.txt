 URL : "https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-js/issues/325" TITLE : through dropdown options BODY : while i was working on an outlook addin, i was adding a dropdown menu to a new dialog. however, i was having a weird issue with a line striking through the elements. the line is located at the location where the botton of the dropdown is located before scrolling. to make sure that other code in my environment wasn't messing with fabric, i essentially copied microsoft's documentation exactly into a new html document and was getting the same issue: i located the issue within microsoft's fluid css: .ms-dropdown-items:before { content: ''; position: absolute; z-index: -1; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; border: 1px solid eaeaea; // this line is the issue } i have temporarily fixed the issue by removing the pseudo-element, using the following css: .ms-dropdown-items:before { content: none; } i was hoping that this can either serve as a solution to others that are encountering this issue, or if anyone has a better solution, i'm all ears. as a note, these were the cdn files that i have included: <link rel= stylesheet href= https://static2.sharepointonline.com/files/fabric/office-ui-fabric-js/1.2.0/css/fabric.min.css > <link rel= stylesheet href= https://static2.sharepointonline.com/files/fabric/office-ui-fabric-js/1.2.0/css/fabric.components.min.css > <script src= https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js ></script> <script src= https://static2.sharepointonline.com/files/fabric/office-ui-fabric-js/1.2.0/js/fabric.min.js ></script> image on stack overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44509079/office-ui-fabric-js-line-through-dropdown-options?noredirect=1 comment76039311_44509079
