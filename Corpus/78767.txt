 URL : "https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/215" TITLE : refetching solved quests BODY : - solve quest - upload to osm - immediately manually requests new quests - it is possible that executed query is run on overpass database that is not yet including changes made by the user - as result the same quests that were solved are recreated the same may happen with automatic fetches for quests. statistics about database lag are at https://overpass-api.de/munin/localdomain/localhost.localdomain/osm_db_lag.html to solve this streetcomplete probably need to remember quests that were solved and uploaded recently quests needs to be remembered after upload for longer time than the overpass database lag at time of fetching new quests .
