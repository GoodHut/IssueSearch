 URL : "https://github.com/chrmarti/testissues/issues/8997" TITLE : path not used BODY : <!-- do you have a question? please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode. --> when i don't open vscode from the command line, it cannot find rustc . i moved the path export to my ~/.bashrc , as suggested in !22831, which does update path as expected. $ which rustc rustc is /users/stephen.bush/.cargo/bin/rustc > process.env.path <home>/.cargo/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/x11/bin:/library/tex/texbin i think this is probably related to a similar issue i'm having with python: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47268960/python-environment-and-vscode <!-- use help > report issues to prefill these. --> - vscode version: 1.18.0 - os version: osx 10.11.6 steps to reproduce: 1. add rustc to your path in ~/.bashrc , e.g., export path= ${home}/.cargo/bin:${path} and source it. 2. launch vscode via spotlight and trigger the rust linter. <!-- launch with code --disable-extensions to check. --> reproduces without extensions: no. but this is expected--it works fine from the command line.
