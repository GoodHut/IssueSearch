BODY : hi people, i didn't find anything about it, so i would like to ask you how postal works regarding processes, cron, queue, smtp, etc . i mean, what is the flow chart throw all of this boxes ? i can try to figure out this: - every time we send an email using postal, our smtp server get the email and save it in qeued_messages table in database - there is a 1-minute configurable? cron job the worker? that get rows from the queued_messages. - then they are grouped by batch_key domain to only ask for mx records 1 time per domain - ... here is maybe something regarding sending status, locked messages, etc. - then this worker send a unique or multiple? request to mx servers using smtp protocol - the server could send a request to a webhook based on message status if configured just an figured out approach that surely is wrong... would be fine if somebody could write the right flow diagram even in text and i promise to turn it into a beautiful graphical flow chart...
