 URL : "https://github.com/techfolios/designer-electron/issues/20" TITLE : improve basics page layout BODY : please do work for this task in a branch called issue-020. remove basics page title and divider. no need since basics is highlighted in sidebar. remove inner border around form. the editor window is border enough. use inline labels; use screen real estate more effectively. ideally, entire form can fit on one screen. combine city, postal code, region, country on one line, for example. <img width= 1256 alt= designer-basics src= https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/290288/28934323-3e4d7900-781c-11e7-9e59-e8b8865ab08f.png >
