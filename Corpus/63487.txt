 URL : "https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/1807" TITLE : dynamic import support? BODY : my issue is that sometimes i want to run my html file with from the bundle, <script type= module src= bundle.js ></script> but for vscode debug i also sometimes just include the src, before it is bundled. var dynamic = true; <script type= module src= scripts/main.js ></script> where inside main.js i have if dynamic { var pkg = json.parse fs.readfilesync './package.json', 'utf8' ; } else {import pkg from './package.json';} the import statement of json is going to cause an error because dynamic import doing an import inside of a condition is not going to work. there is a stage 3 proposal for dynamic import: http://2ality.com/2017/01/import-operator.html https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import is this possible with the current rollup? if not, what is going to happen when this is accepted?
