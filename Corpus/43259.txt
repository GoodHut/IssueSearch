 URL : "https://github.com/HellFirePvP/AstralSorcery/issues/273" TITLE : conflict with shaders BODY : im using the 1.10,2 version with sildur shaders and i have found that the mod screw with the sun and moon. instead of being fixed to the sky as they ougth to be they follow the cursor around, for example the sun being stuck directly next to the cursor and moving around with it where ever i look. any ideas as to why that is?
