 URL : "https://github.com/dino/dino/issues/234" TITLE : --prefix does not work BODY : nice cool messenger here. finally a nice looking jabber client! but sadly the build system in combination with --prefix fails. it's simply, because the tool requires libdino , which is not found by ldd. using ld_library_path to fix this temporarily works of course. i guess libdino is _not_ a system library. therefore i'd not install it into the system library path. i'd install it into $prefix/lib/dino/libdino.so.0 and also set the rpath / runpath of the dino executable to $prefix/lib/dino/ . i'm unsure how to fix this correctly i would have created a proper pr otherwise . related 69 207
