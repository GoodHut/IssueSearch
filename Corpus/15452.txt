 URL : "https://github.com/mercmobily/SimpleSchema/issues/1" TITLE : drop the callback BODY : it's all sync code, so i don't see a reason to work with callbacks. can we not make it optional at least? when no callback provided, throw for errors and return the cleaned object instead? this seems so much cleaner the the callback api: js const input = { foo: 'bar' }; try { const cleaned = schema.validate input ; db.save cleaned ; } catch ex { // handle ex }
