 URL : "https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/449" TITLE : pattern matching selector BODY : currently, c permits simplifying linq-ish selectors by only writing the method name, and the rest can be inferred, as shown below. i'd like to propose some sort of simplification to the new pattern matching stuff: c somecollection.where x => somemethod x ; //ugly somecollection.where somemethod ; //awesome somecollection.where x => x is someclass _ ; //ugly somecollection.where is someclass _ ; //my proposal alternatives: c bool issomeclass object x => x is someclass _; somecollection.where issomeclass ; c func<object, bool> issomeclass = x => x is someclass _; somecollection.where issomeclass ; would that be achievable? thanks.
