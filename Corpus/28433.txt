 URL : "https://github.com/ncbi/ngs-tools/issues/4" TITLE : genes.jar not found BODY : hi, i followed the installation from the closed issue, and i was able to configure ngs/ ngs-tools/ and ncbi-vdb/ and sra-tools/. however, in the readme for spark_genes it says i should have a genes.jar file along with other installations. if i can't find genes.jar does that mean i compiled wrong last time and is there installation instructions for the 3 dependencies listed? thanks!
