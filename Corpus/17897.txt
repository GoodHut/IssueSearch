 URL : "https://github.com/ropensci/elastic/issues/206" TITLE : rscript error 400 BODY : i have a r script script.r that loads 25-30k documents in elasticsearch in each execution. the point is that i can execute it in rstudio properly. however, when i try to execute it from command line using rscript i always get the same error: error: 400 - failed to parse in addition: there were 50 or more warnings use warnings to see the first 50 execution halted the strangest thing is that when this error occurs there are loaded different amount of documents in elastic sometimes 1.5k, sometimes 3k, etc... . so it seems that it doesn't occurs always at same time. i am totally sure that i get the 400 error executing the elastic docs_create function. this is the rscript execution: /usr/bin/rscript /rdir/script.r
