 URL : "https://github.com/indigotech/danger/issues/20" TITLE : fix npm install -g check BODY : currently the check fails for definitions in readme pointing how to setup yarn npm install -g is listed as a non recommended alternative . should we allow for npm-install -g yarn ? or remove it from the readme since it is not recommended by yarn themselves? also we are running this check on every single file. instead of only on the inserted diff. this causes false positives to be fired everytime readme.md changes. a lot... finally, we are not checking for the longform npm install --global . so the current check covers only half of the cases...
