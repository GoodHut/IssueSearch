 URL : "https://github.com/unixpickle/JamWiFi/issues/18" TITLE : multiple wifi interfaces BODY : i have two wifi interfaces on my machine: an n network builtin , and an ac network via a usb dongle . will jamming an ap over the the n network also jam any clients connected to that ap over its ac network? or do i have to somehow tell jamwifi to use my ac interface to jam all the clients? and if i do, how do i do that? thanks. and sorry, i'm aware that my ignorance of wifi is showing.
