 URL : "https://github.com/ChristopherRabotin/smd/issues/62" TITLE : pure helio simulation BODY : simulate helio trajectories from earth to mars, and from mars to earth, by only increasing the velocity and all the way until mars's orbit no ephemeris . do not use direct optimization for this. only velocity increase. this will be a core result. probably: - use go-flags to specify the name of the thrusters and the count of each. - start from earth position and go to mars position. then later, input the hyperbolic vectors for a more precise simulation.
