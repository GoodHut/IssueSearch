 URL : "https://github.com/yarden/MISO/issues/105" TITLE : issue parsing queue job id BODY : i ran into an issue using the cluster to run miso, where the job id number is not properly parsed from the queue output. the error occurs at line 233 of ./misopy/cluster_utils.py. this is the message: valueerror: invalid literal for int with base 10: 'jsv: no h_data is set; setting default h_data=1g if this value is too small, the job will fail your job 260032 gene_psi_batch_0_time_07-27-17_14-28-44' so the parsing statement does not work correctly if any warnings are thrown during queue submission. i noticed that there is an optional flag --no-wait that circumvents the issue, so anyone else encountering this issue should use that for the time being.
