 URL : "https://github.com/coreos/etcd-operator/issues/941" TITLE : s3 backup only runs once BODY : hi, i have etcd-operator running in kubernetes- when i create the deployment, i give it the s3 credentials, and that works fine. my issue is, after it starts, no matter what the backupintervalinsecond is, it will only run the first time, and never again. i haven't seen anything in the logs about the backup running when i run kubectl logs -f $podname , but looking at the mod time of the backup in s3 i can see it isn't being changed, and when i delete/recreate the cluster deployment to restore the cluster from a backup , any data i pushed after the backup that was first run is gone. i've attached my 2 deploys, but they are pretty close to the examples. etcd-deployment.txt https://github.com/coreos/etcd-operator/files/900406/etcd-deployment.txt etcd-operator-deployment.txt https://github.com/coreos/etcd-operator/files/900413/etcd-operator-deployment.txt
