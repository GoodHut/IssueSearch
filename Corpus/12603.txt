 URL : "https://github.com/ari/moneyworks-cli/issues/2" TITLE : python 3 version BODY : hi ari, i've just seen this project and have been porting to python 3. almost have it working - i can replicate the functionality in the read.me above the 'advanced tasks heading so far. changes are relatively simple - print is now print , and urllib.quote_plus is now urllib.parse.quote_plus. i haven't used github much -- so how do i keep this for others? branch it / fork it?
