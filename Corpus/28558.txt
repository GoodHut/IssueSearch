 URL : "https://github.com/MasterGeneral156/chivalry-engine/issues/35" TITLE : guild warring ideas BODY : i'm not too sure how i wish to handle guild wars. in other engines, its handled by losing points/respect whenever one of your guild mates falls in battle, and the war continues indefinitely until either guild reaches zero points. i was playing around with the idea of a war period being 72 hours in length changeable via staff panel , and it being accumulative points. the guild with the most points after the time period is up, is the winner of this war. of course, there's two reasons to war other guilds. for guild experience/levels, and the privilege to claim a town under control by your guild. controlling a town will allow you to set tax rates on that town, and leveling your guild allows you to increase your guild's vault size, guild gym output and guild member capacity, so it is worthwhile to war. any thoughts/concerns/questions?
