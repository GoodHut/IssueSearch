BODY : hi thomas, i was wondering if there was some arduino library for some atmel uc with the canbus controller integrated and i found your code. the question is how to make the porting that uses your library in substitution to the mcp_can.h and mcp_can.c on which many arduino examples are made. the idea is to use the atmega16m1 instead of the classic atmega328p with the mcp2515 external can controller. do you think that it's possible? have you thought on this possibility? thanks in advance
