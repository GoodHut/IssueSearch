 URL : "https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/4846" TITLE : 3d tiles inspector BODY : this will allow us to remove a lot of prototype and duplicate code in sandcastle examples, and will allow users to embed the inspector in their apps for easily debugging and profiling. the ui design is open-ended; feel free to make it much better than the collection of buttons in the sandcastle examples. phase one is to just replace the debugging functionality already in the sandcastle examples; we can do more pull requests as new features are needed. do not worry about the current style options in the sandcastle examples for the first pull request. features based on the debug options in the sandcastle example: http://localhost:8080/apps/sandcastle/index.html?src=3d%20tiles.html&label=showcases show stats and show pick stats . these could be shown in the inspector ui instead of the console. keep the separation of the inspector and the 3d tiles rendering clean; the inspector would just pull the fields from cesium3dtileset . freeze frame colorize show bounding volumes , show contents , and show request volume change sse - have a slider and be able to set an explicit value enable dynamic sse change density and factor - similiar to sse above trim tiles cache enable picking new features be able to pragmatically pass a tileset to the inspector be able to click on a tileset when the inspector is open to inspect it performance display - just like the cesium inspector for convenience show wireframe ignore batch table - should force a tileset reload show the url of a clicked tile remove similar code in the 3d tiles sandcastle examples in the 3d-tiles branch and branches off of 3d-tiles and instead add the 3d tiles inspector. --- for @austineng when ready.
