 URL : "https://github.com/Fluorohydride/ygopro/issues/1955" TITLE : double card resolution BODY : hello. i have been making floss version yu-gi-oh for a month. as a default card resolution, i set a doubled default value 354x508 . in general, a large impact is not on the game except one exception when the card is invoked. will anyone be modifying for ygopro to use high quality cards? and such an additional question - can you turn on fullscreen / variable window resolution like in unofficial ygopro versions?
