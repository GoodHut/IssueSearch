 URL : "https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-kotlin/issues/103" TITLE : open source license? BODY : hi! would like to use this library, but it is not obvious which license it is released under. is it supposed to be the same as jackson-modules-base, apache 2.0? could you please specify license in readme, or better in a separate license file? if not it really is all rights reserved . cheers, alf
