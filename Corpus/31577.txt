 URL : "https://github.com/FRadford/pygame-systems/issues/4" TITLE : sprite sheet system BODY : for some reason spritesheets aren't a built in feature of pygame, despite there being a specific sprite class. fortunately on the wiki there is a class implementation from python2 http://pygame.org/wiki/spritesheet http://pygame.org/wiki/spritesheet which shouldn't be too hard to convert to python3.
