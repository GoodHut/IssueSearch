 URL : "https://github.com/ghislainf/zf2-whoops/issues/21" TITLE : can we have a 1.0 release? BODY : this code hasn't changed in quite a while but a release hasn't been tagged since 2013; it would be nice if we had a released version we could pin in composer.json instead of relying on dev-master. is there any reason we can't do this? if there are known issues holding up a release, i'd be willing to contribute some time to help resolve them.
