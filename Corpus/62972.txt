 URL : "https://github.com/piwik/piwik-sdk-ios/issues/204" TITLE : custom variables in 4.x BODY : we have a legacy project that relies on the use of custom variables. we can't readily change to custom dimensions, so until now we've been forced to stay on the old 3.x version of the sdk. however, we really want to move to the 4.x branch of the sdk so we don't run into a situation where the old sdk breaks for some reason and we're left unsupported. so what i've done is add support for custom variables and improve the objc-interop a little , largely following the implementation pattern for custom dimensions. can we contribute the code to the project?
