 URL : "https://github.com/gigibyte927/comments-4orum/issues/8" TITLE : set up testing framework BODY : we really need to get our test framework set up at this point, our app is getting more complicated and we need to make sure we aren't breaking it any given point. django has a built-in testing framework for models and other basic functionality, but we also need a way of testing our views and making sure users can or cannot see content. we should also use https://travis-ci.org/ so we can see our test results after any commit gets pushed to the repo.
