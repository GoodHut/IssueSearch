 URL : "https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/issues/2139" TITLE : optionally avoid -i. BODY : having the current source directory in the include path breaks things for the pulseaudio build and anything that has a header name that overlaps with any other header name in the include path . while in my opinion, this is broken behaviour current directory as include directory is always explicitly specified in other systems . from irl discussion, @jpakkane disagrees, but is okay with an off-by-default argument to disable the local directory include, so that's likely the way forward.
