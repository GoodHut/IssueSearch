 URL : "https://github.com/GUITARPLRC/React-Movie/issues/10" TITLE : refactored your project BODY : hi i found your portfolio a few months ago and thought your movie app would be an interesting project to reproduce. live https://reactreduxmovie.firebaseapp.com repo https://github.com/rehabescapi/moviedetails/tree/appv1 i implemented it with react/redux with an initial approach to keeping the front end looking as similar as possible. just wanted to give you a heads up before and a chance to ask for any changes before i add it to my portfolio. app/config/constants has a template file to add your api keys. thanks, jason
