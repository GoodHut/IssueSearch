 URL : "https://github.com/Financial-Times/polyfill-service/issues/1377" TITLE : how to support shadow dom BODY : with custom element support in 1376, it'd be great to land shadow dom as well. problem is, because of how hard shadow dom is to polyfill, it's broken into two shims: - shadydom https://github.com/webcomponents/shadydom , shim for dom aspect of shadow dom attachshadow , shim .children etc - shadycss https://github.com/webcomponents/shadycss , shim for scoping styles applied in a shadow root. trickier to use - much less of a polyfill than shadydom, can't just drop in and go. given this, what's the best way to attempt loading these polyfills? could they perhaps be loaded as shadowdom.~shadydom and shadowdom.~shadycss with shadow dom importing both? e.g. if you want to use all of polymer's features, you need to import both. but a library like skatejs or just vanilla web components, you may only choose shadydom thanks, and happy to make a pr if can work this out :
