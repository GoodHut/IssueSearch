 URL : "https://github.com/pulibrary/orangelight/issues/1003" TITLE : locations constant error BODY : the error actionview::template::error: uninitialized constant applicationhelper::locations seems to be the most common one raised by ol. it is initialized in https://github.com/pulibrary/orangelight/blob/master/config/initializers/locations_initializer.rb. it stores all the locations information in constant for use in building out what the user the sees in the holdings sidebar. i'm not really sure why this comes up so frequently. if you look at the honeybadger logs it is clearly being raised by a bot trawling through the facet links. it is curious it comes up so much since i thought the initializers only ran when the app is started up but maybe that was a misunderstanding.
