 URL : "https://github.com/arcticicestudio/igloo/issues/32" TITLE : auto toggle sign column BODY : vim 8 introduced a new option to configure the state of the sign column to be always visible yes , always hidden no or to automatically toggle auto when signs are available to display. this improvement is related to the warning message added to airblade/vim-gitgutter@dc73a81 which also advises to remove the custom option g:gitgutter_sign_column_always = 1 and use set signcolumn = auto instead.
