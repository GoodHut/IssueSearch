 URL : "https://github.com/rails-oceania/roro/issues/124" TITLE : server-side split testing BODY : hi, i'd like to do a 15m talk about server-side split testing in a rails app. i will cover an introduction to what split testing a/b testing is, the difference between server-side and client-side solutions, the things you have to be mindful of when implementing a server-side solution, a run-through of the implementation that we use in my company's rails app, and i will finish with some case studies of a few of the split tests that we have run and the surprising results that we have received. from a technical perspective i will cover: - how to identify sessions that are to be part of the experiment - how to ensure an even, or controlled, split between different versions - how to ensure that your implementation respects your caching infrastructure - how to ensure a single customer sees the same page every time they visit - how to vary your content based on the variant that has been chosen - how to provide the data back to the reporting engine i would hope that the content is fairly accessible to beginners, particularly the case studies, and i will try and keep the code samples light, but there should be a bit in there for more experienced devs too. it should be ready for june, or may at a push. does that sound like something you'd like to see? nick
