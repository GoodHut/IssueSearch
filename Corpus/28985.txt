 URL : "https://github.com/konifar/android-material-design-icon-generator-plugin/issues/69" TITLE : include other icons BODY : hey just a quick suggestion. there's a repository that includes the google material icons but also has icons created by other artists. seeing that google rarely adds new icons would you be willing to include these https://materialdesignicons.com/ as well? it would help the community out a lot as it's updated constantly and also the artists who created those icons would benefit as well.
