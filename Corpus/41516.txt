 URL : "https://github.com/owen-it/laravel-auditing/issues/283" TITLE : ability to tag audits BODY : it would be nice if you could 'tag' the audits for models, that way you can group similar relations and pull down all the audits for that tag. e.g. lets assume you have a product model which has a prices relation for specifying varying different prices in different currencies, or a features relation specifying different features / configuration for the products - if you could get all the audits for the product in one go it would be cool. code examples: php $product = product::find 1 ; $audits = audit::tagged 'product-' . $product->getkey ->paginate 50 ; to tag versions, you can add a function on your model, which get's called when an audit is created so it knows how to tag it: php class product extends model { public function tagaudit audit $audit { return 'product-' . $this->getkey ; } supporting multiple tags for a model could be an option, too.
