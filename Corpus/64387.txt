 URL : "https://github.com/mcaceresb/stata-gtools/issues/4" TITLE : gegen group misc issues BODY : a few issues with gegen : - it doesn't seem to respect the order of the data. eg: stata sysuse auto, clear egen id1 = group turn trunk fegen id2 = group turn trunk gegen id3 = group turn trunk assert id1==id2 assert id1==id3 the last command fails as the ids are not the same - it doesn't warn for incorrect options: stata gegen id = group turn , wrongoption should give a warning that an incorrect option was used.
