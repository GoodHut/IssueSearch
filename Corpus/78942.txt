 URL : "https://github.com/smooch/smooch-web/issues/643" TITLE : replacement for whispers BODY : i've been trying to contact you guys for 20 minutes via chat and i haven't received a reply. it's impossible to find a support email, so i'm opening an issue. i'm very disappointed of smooch, to say the least. last month you removed completely the whispers and i didn't receive not even one email regarding this breaking change. i'm using smooch as a sales channel, and now i've lost a full month of users not receiving messages. and it could have been way more than a month, since i just logged in to add a new whisper only to not find that section, then google it and figure out it has been removed. what a mess. the worst thing is that the «replacement» is to trigger an api call or something like that. i can't afford so many hours just to make a feature work as it was intended. i just want to greet the user when he loads the page, that's it. i tried referring to this documentation, but there's just a way to send a message on the user's behalf, but not on the agent side. i'm about to cancel my smooch services if this is not promptly fixed. thanks.
