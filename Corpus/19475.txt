 URL : "https://github.com/carloslenz/epp/issues/1" TITLE : add custom errors? BODY : a provisional idea: > type customerrorbuilder struct { > ids string >} > >type customerror struct { > ids string > message string >} > >func newtype ids ...string customerrorbuilder ... > >func b customerrorbuilder subtype id string error ... > >func b customerrorbuilder new msg string error ... > >func b customerrorbuilder matches e error bool ... customerrorbuilder could also declare keys that would have their value set during new. in this design static type checking is inferior to hand-made error types, so maybe a generator would be better. on the other hand, error in golang is already an interface and specific error types are generally hidden.
