 URL : "https://github.com/williamsbdev/ember-cli-auto-register/issues/12" TITLE : add support for pods BODY : idea behind this extension is great, although is a pity that it can not work out of the box with pods structure. for now i basically copy and paste solution and adjust it locally but it would be nice to have something common object.keys require.entries .filter path => /repository$/.test path .foreach path => { const module = require path, null, null, true ; const filename = path.match / ^\/ +\/?$/ 0 ; application.register repository:${filename} , module 'default' ; } ;
