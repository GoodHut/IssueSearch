BODY : hi alex, firstly thanks again for your fantastic work on this project! we've been using render since 2.0 and i see that you've recently dropped support for ios 9 see https://github.com/alexdrone/render/commit/798d1e2b7d143206b66f0b5e055e40b54e35d670 . the app we're building needs to support the ipad 2 and 3, which _cannot_ upgrade to ios 10. i'd really love to know: was the choice to make ios 10 the minimum deployment target was done knowing that it would alienate those above devices? i.e. did you consider this before deciding the change was necessary, or were you now aware of this? i only ask this as: - if it were done with consideration, then i'll need to fork this for ios 9 compatibility myself. - if you weren't aware of this, perhaps i could help you bring this project back to supporting ios 9? either way, do you know what specific features were added that require ios 10? thanks in advance! cheers, brendan
