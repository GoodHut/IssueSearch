BODY : this so far has been buried in this and related issues: https://github.com/interlock-rochester/interlock-rochester.github.io.src/issues/19 but i want to surface this as its own item: do we want to continue hosting on ghpt's linode vps or use github pages? if the latter, who wants to step up and make that happen? we can bruit around pros and cons here, and any next steps for either platform.
