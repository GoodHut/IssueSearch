 URL : "https://github.com/monicahq/monica/issues/25" TITLE : speed up add a person ui BODY : as a user with many friends to add, i'd like to be able to quickly get all the basic info for people who matter to me into the system in as few interactions as possible. some ideas: - give options submit and add more information and submit and add someone else to submit a new person - don't default to man, force me to click on man or woman for each person although this is an extra click 50% of the time, i forgot i had to select woman for several people and had to come back and edit, which took more time over all - include add a new person as a direct link in the header
