 URL : "https://github.com/ivmai/bdwgc/issues/186" TITLE : assert during finalize BODY : i'm hoping someone can point me in the right direction as to what this error could mean so i can fix the issue. i'm having the following assert fire shortly after startup of our application when an allocation of a large block of memory occurs: https://github.com/ivmai/bdwgc/blob/master/finalize.c l1026 / unhide object pointer so any future collections will / / see it. / curr_fo -> fo_hidden_base = word gc_reveal_pointer curr_fo -> fo_hidden_base ; gc_bytes_finalized += curr_fo -> fo_object_size + sizeof struct finalizable_object ; gc_assert gc_is_marked gc_base curr_fo ; // <-- assert fails! curr_fo = next_fo; what could cause the finalizing object not be marked at this point? any other diagnostics i could enable to help track the problem?
