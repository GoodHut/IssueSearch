 URL : "https://github.com/ioos/catalog/issues/31" TITLE : maracoos roms espresso BODY : i'm looking on https://data.ioos.us for the maracoos rutgers roms ocean forecast espresso that was previously on the ngdc geoportal. maybe i'm not searching effectively, but i believe we should be there somewhere. the end points at http://tds.marine.rutgers.edu/thredds/roms/espresso/2013_da/catalog.html have not moved in a while. - john.
