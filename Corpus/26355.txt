 URL : "https://github.com/Akryum/vue-supply/issues/5" TITLE : apollo + vue + vuex BODY : hi, i'm looking to integrate these things: - vue - vuex - apollo is it right to assume i need to use vue-supply + vue-apollo for this? ou just vue-supply will be enough? i've already got vue + apollo working with vue-apollo , as a proof of concept. it all seems to work pretty well. so the next move would be to put vuex in the middle, and by looking at some others issues i see that i'm not alone in this path. there were some suggestions here and there, and also some very basic examples in the project readme , but i couldn't get it to work yet. it'd be nice to have a more concise clarification as well as some examples on how to combine all these amazing things together. thanks
