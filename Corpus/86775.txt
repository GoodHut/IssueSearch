 URL : "https://github.com/nuxsmin/sysPass/issues/625" TITLE : import xml worked, but... BODY : i installed a fresh version onto my ubuntu 16.04 system. before, i was running syspass on my centos 6.9 system without issue. when i try to import a recently exported account list, it imports fine, but all the passwords are some random string - perhaps the hash instead of the password? any idea how i can get my passwords back? i sill have the old system in place... thanks! joe
