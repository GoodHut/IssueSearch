 URL : "https://github.com/mgree/phpenkoder/issues/1" TITLE : parse full html BODY : phpenkoder presently works by running regular expressions over the entirety of the_content . apparently doing so can lead to wrong encodings. it should be possible to work in a more principled way: - capture all of the output from wordpress. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/772510/wordpress-filter-to-modify-final-html-output - properly parse it as html. - traverse the parsed ast and find/replace in the body only and exactly a nodes with mailtos in the href attribute and cdata and pcdata with plaintext emails in them. - serialize and output the html. huge pro: phpenkoder works cleaner and is almost surely more correct. significant con: phpenkoder will interact even less well with other plugins. significant con: phpenkoder will be much slower.
