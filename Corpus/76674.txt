 URL : "https://github.com/awsmug/shipcloud-for-woocommerce/issues/113" TITLE : log: introduct log level BODY : currently logging is centralized and has one level. this isn't enough for debugging and finding problems as logs either grow very large due to only one log level or contain almost no information due to missing logging at some functions. implement the psr-3 logging interface and add logging to some public methods. - see \wc_shipcloud_shipping::log
