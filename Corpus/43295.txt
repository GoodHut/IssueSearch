 URL : "https://github.com/benwbrum/fromthepage/issues/874" TITLE : contentdm iiif import BODY : import: create a new contentdm integration library. it should contain these methods: one that takes a iiif manifest and derives a contentdm api endpoint iiiftocdm metadata update -- about a page or a object? loop through a list of pages whether those pages are iiif canvases or ftp pages or some contentdm list of objects and for each page for each page, hit the contentdm api, pulls back it's metadata stick the metadata as json into a new blob on the ftp page, pruning out the transcript field at the same time. optionally if ocr correction is specified in the import , we should stick the transcript field into the source text field of the page object. we want 2 hooks to get into this library. rake task to retrospectively update page metadata during a iiif import -- question: how do we tell a iiif import is from contentdm? prompt? derive? do magic? eventually a seealso link, but contentdm doesn't have it yet _question: will we be able to make this a simple call from a iiif canvas to the page specific contentdm api? or wre we going to have to navigate up to the contentdm compound object and get some listing?_ need to have a new json field on pages table for the metadata call it external_metadata or source_metadata _question: do works have metadata associated with it?_
