 URL : "https://github.com/lunartrinity/kyu/issues/1" TITLE : kyu npm name BODY : hi mr. hartono, is there any possibility that you can transfer the ownership of this package on npm. i find that this has been inactive for a while and it'd be great if i can use the name for an personal ongoing project. if you want to keep the name, feel free to close this issue. thank you in advance, tung
