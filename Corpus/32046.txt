 URL : "https://github.com/FozzTexx/ws2812-demo/issues/4" TITLE : timings are way off BODY : this worked only with ws2812b devices ws2812 failed . i looked at the signals with a logic analyzer and the values were way off. i suspect you had a typo that just happened to work given the particular ways ws2812s are timing tolerant in general - but they are very strict in other ways, which is why the older ones with slightly different specs failed.
