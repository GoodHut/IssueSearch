 URL : "https://github.com/kangarko/ChatControl-Pro/issues/478" TITLE : message priority issue BODY : greetings, i've made a ticket about this before, in which i was adviced to disable things in essentials plugin.yml. so i did. however, after every reboot /msg turns into /whisper from essentials. even though i've disabled it and configured chatcontrol to take over. by unloading chatcontrol, /msg becomes unregistered, so no whispering either. by reloading chatcontrol using /chc reload, /msg becomes /msg, as it is intended. config: https://hastebin.com/nenavimevi.php please advice, managering
