 URL : "https://github.com/praekelt/django-recaptcha/issues/134" TITLE : not seeing template files? BODY : for some reason my code was working a month or two ago but is not working any more? i am getting the following error on my contact page. templatedoesnotexist at /contact/ captcha/widget_nocaptcha.html my contact page uses the quick method outlined in your documentation. my server works as of version django-recaptcha==1.2.0. i recently installed python 2.7.13 and updated the environment variables then when it was found not working i changed them back to python 2.7.8 but still it did not work and i was getting this error. i looked into the site-packages and templates/captcha//widget_nocaptcha.html is there. very annoying and confusing. none of my other packages are acting up. any help appreciated.
