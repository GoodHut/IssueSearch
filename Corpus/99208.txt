 URL : "https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/issues/7045" TITLE : mavlink rc override switch BODY : i have been looking at using mavlink rc inputs via mission planner and then via a pi but the thought of only being able to regain control by clicking a button on mission planner has put me off testing it. ideally if one of the auxilliary function switches could be assigned to switch between mavlink rc and regular rc then i could just use a switch on the handset like a trainer switch where i could take control at any time from the other operator without a mad dash to click a button on mission planner.
