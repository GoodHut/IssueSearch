 URL : "https://github.com/WarEmu/WarBugs/issues/10896" TITLE : enemy addon in warband BODY : expected behavior: enemy party icons should show updating health bars and light up icons when they are in your proximity. these party icons should also update on your map. actual behavior: enemy party icons are not updating health bars, nor lighting up the icons when they are in your proximity. this only occurs in warbands within groups that are not full 6 members . as soon as 6 members fill the warband group, the bug goes away. party icons do not update on the map continuously until the warband group as six members. steps to reproduce the problem: create a warband with two or more people, but less than six. note health bars or proximity of the party units.
