 URL : "https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/1301" TITLE : create path operation BODY : this operation would allow users to traverse a gaffer graph and return the path from each seed to the destination. the path returned should be a list of the edges traversed including properties . the path operation could simply have a list of getelements operations. the operation could then be handled by executing a getelements operation, adding the results to an in memory set, extracting the the vertex at the other end of the edge, then executing the next operation. after each stage we should remove edges from the in memory set that are no longer required to reduce the amount of memory used. after all getelements operations have been executed we would then need to build up the list of paths. the return type could be iterable<iterable<edge>>. for example if you queried for a and b. a->c, c->d , a->c, c-e , b->d, d->f b->a, a->c it may need a better name instead of 'path'.
