 URL : "https://github.com/gsummer/cyNeo4j/issues/16" TITLE : neo4j 3.x plans? BODY : are there plans to support this plugin for neo4j 3.x? i've tried installing the necessary extensions in neo4j 3.x, so that i can use cyneo4j, but the neo4j extensions just produce stack traces and the cystoscape plugin doesn't seem to do anything. if there is still active interested & development on this project, i'll add the stack traces.
