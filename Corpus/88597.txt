 URL : "https://github.com/pubs/pubs/issues/75" TITLE : note command improvements BODY : _originally in 70_ add sub-commands for notes, the same way docs are handled except that there would be an edit command for notes. this enables for example dumping the notes to stdout from a simple pubs doc open -w cat <citekey> . the idea is then that user specific behaviors like piping to pandoc are easy to customize with the alias plugin. the first steps for that should be the following: - store note attachments in the metadata, should we support several note files for one paper? - add and implement sub-commands for notes add, edit, open, remove, - implement migration to track note files from older repositories that do not register notes in metadata.
