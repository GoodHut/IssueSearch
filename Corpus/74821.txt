 URL : "https://github.com/tgillett/LibreRouter-Testing-Phase-1/issues/19" TITLE : firmware build / loading BODY : we are unable to build and load new firmware on the prototype boards. the current firmware is a binary copy of firmware from a reference board. sysupgrade does not appear to work in the current firmware. loading new firmware requires binary copying of kernel and rootfs partitions via uboot. it is not obvious how to generate these binaries from the normal lede build process for the ap135 target.
