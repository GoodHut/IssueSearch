 URL : "https://github.com/keithjgrant/omnibear/issues/28" TITLE : add syndication targets BODY : would be great to tell my blog to tweet my post too, right from omnibear, especially when it's in reply to a tweet. you can get the targets by doing a get to the endpoint with ?q=syndicate-to and the access token. https://www.w3.org/tr/micropub/ syndication-targets then, when the button is pressed / checkbox is chosen, add a mp-syndicate-to field with the value of the button / syndication target, to the post request. that gives the order to syndicate. i think my own blog and some other people support syndicate-to as the post field, but that one is depricated. better to use the new one.
