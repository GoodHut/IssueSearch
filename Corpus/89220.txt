 URL : "https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues/5931" TITLE : preserve3d child elements BODY : it appears that some test cases are incorrectly considering the nested elements of a preserve-3d stacking context to have separate rendering contexts. for example, transform3d-sorting-004 https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/blob/master/css/css-transforms-2/transform3d-sorting-004.html explains the expected behavior as: > 'transform-style: preserve-3d' only affects children, not grandchildren, so the two divs with backgrounds are still in different rendering contexts and the z-position should still not affect stacking. however, the specification differs notice the emphasis : > an element participates in a 3d rendering context if its containing block establishes or extends a 3d rendering context. we have issue 1362543 https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1362543 to investigate this for firefox, which is currently passing the test. chrome, though, fails this test. perhaps, it's doing the right thing after all? if there is a consensus that this behavior is tested incorrectly, i can assemble a pr that fixes several tests relying on it.
