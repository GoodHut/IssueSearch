 URL : "https://github.com/RepairShopr/react-native-signature-capture/issues/46" TITLE : scrolling occurs on ios BODY : first of all, thank you for creating such a useful package. installation instructions were accurate, and i am getting successful builds on both ios and android. on android, the signaturecapture component is working as expected, but i am having issues with ios. when i try to draw my signature in ios, my screen scrolls up and down and nothing is drawn on the component. i tried changing the styling a bit, but this doesn't resolve the issue unfortunately. please let me know what you think, and thank you.
