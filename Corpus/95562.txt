 URL : "https://github.com/deliciousbrains/wp-amazon-s3-and-cloudfront/issues/382" TITLE : default url format changed BODY : according to the documentation https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-offload-s3/doc/settings/ the url format should be similar to the following: https://s3.amazonaws.com... our url format used to match that format: https://s3 .amazonaws.com/bucketname/filepath/filename when we upgraded to the latest version 1.1.6 from version 1.1.3 the default url format changed to the following: https://bucketname.s3 .amazonaws.com/filepath/filename is there a reason the format has changed and the documentation isn't updated? and is there a way we can get the old format to work? we are running into issues with the new url format as it appears to be pointing to a different endpoint in aws.
