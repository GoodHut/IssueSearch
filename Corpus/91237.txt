 URL : "https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/164" TITLE : telnet connection refused BODY : hello, currently i am trying to port postmarketos to my old xperia z2. i am basing the port on the sony xperia z1 compact port. i successfully built my own kernel and booted it up - the device gets recognized in ifconfig but the telnet connections fails with connection refused. i also did an nmap scan on the device and as it seems all ports are closed. also i don't see any logo on the screen. did i miss something important?
