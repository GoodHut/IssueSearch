 URL : "https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-overlays/issues/189" TITLE : 0.8.0 should be 1.0.0 BODY : the 0.8.0 release actually contains some breaking changes as users will now need to: - migrate to using react-transition-group for the transition component, and - remove backdroptransitiontimeout and dialogtransitiontimeout from the <modal /> components and add timeout to the transition component instead these steps weren't included in the changelog, so it was a bit of a surprise when a minor version upgrade broke a bunch of our component. it would be great if the library's version would reflect those breaking changes by doing a major version bump. hope this request doesn't come across as snarky. just wanted to make a recommendation to ease the upgrade progress for other users.
