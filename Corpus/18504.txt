 URL : "https://github.com/Yelnats321/EntityPlus/issues/20" TITLE : the future, c++17 BODY : this project is currently in a bit of a limbo state. the version for all intents and purposes should be at 2.0, however i am afraid there are certain features/changes that are not backwards compatible that i want to make before i release, but have not had the time to sit down and examine the code thoroughly to make the change. i am currently very busy with school work, and i don't see it slowing down for at least a month or two. with all this being said, i want to wait until gcc/clang/msvc support c++17, or at least most of the nice features that are coming with that standard version. i think that when that happens, i will rewrite a lot of the code to use these features and support c++17 only. this would mean nicer error codes and a more simplifications in the code. however, this may reduce the userbase of the library. to combat this standard version bump, i will rewrite the code alongside a 2.0 release. that way, any features or breaking changes that occur as a natural result of the rewrite can be also ported into the 2.0 release. the rewrite will force me into the state of mind that i need to be in to further extend and enhance the library, as i have not touched the code for some time now. in effect, there will be a 2.0 and 3.0 release simultaneously, with the only difference between the two being compiler/standard version. i don't know if a standard version increase is a deal breaker for any users or potential users , so i would like to hear your input too.
