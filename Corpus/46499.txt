 URL : "https://github.com/restrictcontentpro/restrict-content-pro/issues/1262" TITLE : members list ordering BODY : not sure what ordering is being used for these pages currently, but it would be useful if we could see most recent users for each filtered list. e.g. active include recent renewals at the top of the list, not just recently joined. could 'joined date' and 'last renewed' columns be introduced too? you could remove the 'status' column pending most recently joined/renewed first expired most recently expired first cancelled expired users last, cancelled but non-expired at the top ordered by expiry date
