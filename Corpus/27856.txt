 URL : "https://github.com/radare/radare2/issues/8323" TITLE : enhance pdb support BODY : r2 should open foo.pdb file when loading foo.exe or foo.dll in the same directory if the file exists. i?~pdb shows nothing, the commands are idpd, but that's only show in id? so its hard to find r2 foo.pdb shows no symbols, debug info or anything, pdb files are not handled by any bin plugin the only way to import pdb into r2 is by using the .idp which is not efficient should use api , not fork, .etc    imho r2 should have a ~/.config/radare2/pdb to put all the pdbs it downloads as a cache e dir.pdb   idp is so much verbose too much errors parsing simple pdbs uncorrect type error while parsing type skipping __guard_longjmp_table, segment 7 does not exist
