 URL : "https://github.com/DeeZone/rest-api-go/issues/3" TITLE : add config file BODY : add support for configuration of the app at the file level. - level configuration settings out of the app. allow app configuration at run time via configuration file - possible settings - app port number > don't fix the port number in code. some other product may have picked the same port as you and you never know when you'll have to co-exist on a server, so put the port number in a configuration file somewhere so it can be changed without a recompile if necessary. the ability to change port number can also be helpful for getting through firewalls without having to get them reconfigured. you can always default to your chosen value if the configuration file doesn't exist.
