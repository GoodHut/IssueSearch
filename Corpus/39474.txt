 URL : "https://github.com/ScreepsOCS/screeps.behaviour-action-pattern/issues/453" TITLE : setup queue refactor BODY : i would like to propose a change to the creep.setup api to make it more extensible and to allow customizations based on rcl and player strategy. currently setup queuing is managed by spawn.extend and usually extended via global.extend which explains why global must be extended after all built-ins in viral.global.js: spawn.prioritylow.push creep.setup.mysetup1 ; spawn.priorityhigh.push creep.setup.mysetup2 ; i propose moving these into creep.setup like this: in creep.setup.mysetup2.js: setup.rcl = { 1: { // ... highpriority: 100, }, // ... this is cached into 2 accessors which will function similar to the current logic: room.prototype.setupqueuehigh room.prototype.setupqueuelow these lists will be sorted each time they are accessed and the sort cached per-room, but access to these lists will also be lazy so that only the high priority queue will be created for most rooms.
