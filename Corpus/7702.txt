 URL : "https://github.com/maliksahil/Angular2AzureADAuthLib/issues/3" TITLE : id_token in url BODY : first, thanks for the sample code on ng2 to adal. after aad authentication id_token is being appended to redirecturi, but angular2 is not accepting id_token in url parameter. response url: _https://localhost:44345/ id_token=<<some_jwt_token>>_ angular 2 error message: _error: uncaught in promise : error: cannot match any routes: '' error: cannot match any routes: ''_ your agularjs example from pluralsight is not appending id_token to the url. i'm not sure it's related to adal.js version. is there any way to strip out id_token from url or handle this ' id_token' param in router module? thanks in advance!
