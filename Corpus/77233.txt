 URL : "https://github.com/ArduPilot/apm_planner/issues/1002" TITLE : move app data directory. BODY : it's a relatively minor issue, but could the default directories for app data be moved? specifically to qstandardpaths::applocaldatalocation . http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qstandardpaths.html this way, apm planner's app data, logs, and whatnot will be mapped to the platform specific app data directories instead of a user's home folder. even though this https://github.com/ardupilot/apm_planner/issues/730 issue was closed, it still affects me on macos sierra with apm planner 2.0.24. moving the directory would probably alleviate the issue altogether and place nicely with each respective platform. i would be happy to submit a pull request if you'd like, but this seemed like such a small issue that it wasn't worth forking, creating a new branch, etc.
