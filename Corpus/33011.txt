 URL : "https://github.com/ushahidi/platform/issues/2080" TITLE : 2chauzi facebook bot BODY : minor feature improvements would make major user enhancements on the bot. this is the minimum scope that i would recommend for 2chaguzi. i'll open an additional issue for other bot issues to be prioritized. - remove block to getting started, update into text to: “hello! welcome to uchaguzi citizen reporter. uchaguzi’s aim is to help kenya have a free, fair, peaceful, and credible general election. keep an eye on the vote and submit any reports of issues that impact the election. in a few words, describe what you would like to report.” - fb bot should not hit rate limit as a single user - reports from facebook should be tagged as “via facebook messenger” - remove survey mapping from bot - gather report after 30m timeout, even if the user doesn’t hit submit, after which a new report will be started if they begin chat again references 1702
