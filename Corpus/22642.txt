 URL : "https://github.com/NCI-Thesaurus/thesaurus-obo-edition/issues/8" TITLE : make oncotree slim BODY : oncotree seems to already be mapped to ncit. it should be trivial to convert this file to rdf, add oncotree subset tags to these terms in our release, and then release an oncotree slim that uses the ncit identifiers natively. the file i found was in their api, not sure if there are other files elsewhere: http://www.cbioportal.org/oncotree/swagger-ui.html see also: https://github.com/cbioportal/oncotree https://github.com/cbioportal/oncotree-mapping
