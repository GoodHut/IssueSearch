 URL : "https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/922" TITLE : port istio repo to centos BODY : port the istio/istio repository to use centos based images. from initial observation, this mainly effects the mixer, mixer_debug, iptables, and proxy_init containers. there are two possible solutions: build ubuntu and centos based versions of these containers statically link mixs and xtables-multi. mixs uses many system shared objects which may be lacking static libraries for the various distributions intended for support. xtables-multi may be an easier static link, assuming rtnetlink works cross-kernel. i have patches for option 1 to enable more community involvement. i'm not sure immediately how to tackle option 2, especially mixs.
