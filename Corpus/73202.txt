 URL : "https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/2664" TITLE : consul's support for tls BODY : i could not find any mention of which cipher suites are supported by consul when implementing tls. @macb mentioned https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/1349 consul relies on golang now updated to the latest 1.7 version which supports tls back to tls 1.0 included. 1. however, which are the cipher suites supported? i found aes-gcm 128, using pkcs7 padding and aes-gcm 128, no padding mentioned at security.go https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/blob/6f0a3b9bf5c7fd0673213d451bbc9e66f7a9cad9/vendor/github.com/hashicorp/memberlist/security.go . could you kindly confirm please that those are the ciphers specified by consul for the tls configuration that golang needs to be fed with? also, usually a cipher suite for tls is comprised of key-exchange algorithm, bulk cipher algorithm and mac hash algorithm, e.g. tls_rsa_with_3des_ede_cbc_sha. 2. since, aes is for key exchange and gcm is the bulk cipher alg, which hash algorithm are you using? 3. finally, it would be great to have the possibility to customise the cipher suites used and the minimum supported version of tls. thanks a lot in advance.
