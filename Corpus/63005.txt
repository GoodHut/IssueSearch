 URL : "https://github.com/acritelli/beerTracker/issues/4" TITLE : data structure refactor BODY : entire user document shouldn't be initialized with all beers on creation. instead, breweries & beers should only be added to user document when they're needed i.e. a user creates a rating, stars a beer, etc.
