 URL : "https://github.com/seqan/slimm/issues/18" TITLE : build from source locally BODY : i want to suggest that you add information for building slimm from source locally i.e. without root access . following the instructions here http://seqan.readthedocs.io/en/master/infrastructure/use/findseqancmake.html i was able to figure out i needed to use 2 cmake options for it to build, e.g.: cmake ../slimm/src \ -dcmake_prefix_path= $home/bin/applications/seqan/util/cmake \ -dseqan_include_path= $home/bin/applications/seqan/include
