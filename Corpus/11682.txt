 URL : "https://github.com/OutSystems/cordova-plugin-geofence/issues/3" TITLE : is it possible ? BODY : i made an android application for parkings in my country. i added this plugin to my app to add a feature that the user can be notified when he is close to the parking and he is asked to tell us how much the parking is full 0 % / 25 % / 50 % etccc when i tried the plugin with a small raduis 50 meters for exemple in geofence ,i noticed that it not too relible and no working every time . so i'm trying to make a solution of this please tell me if it is possible or not . i will add geofences with app with 100 meters raduis. and i will modify the transitionreceiver.java to make some tasks before the sending the notification to the user ==> i will check the distance between the the parking geofence coords and the the current position if it is less then 50 meters so send the notification if not make nothing. with this solution i will be sure that the notifications will appear only when the distance betwen geofences and current position is 50 meters or less . can you please it can work or not ?
