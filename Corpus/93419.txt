 URL : "https://github.com/appleseedhq/appleseed/issues/1229" TITLE : add support for sss groups BODY : suggested by adrian here: https://forum.appleseedhq.net/t/does-appleseed-support-a-shader-with-sss-grouping/218?u=franz the idea is to be able to treat multiple intersecting/overlapping closed objects with the same sss material as a single object. that means ignoring interior intersections when doing subsurface sampling a stack would be needed to keep track of enter/leave events and only keep the last event .
