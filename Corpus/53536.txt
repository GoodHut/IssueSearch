 URL : "https://github.com/rancher/convoy/issues/192" TITLE : ebs plugin is unstable BODY : we're having serious issues with the ebs plugin. it looks as if the plugin doesn't perform the necessary checks the cluster-wide status of a volume. we've seen issues both where rancher tries to attach an already attached volume to a host, and where it assumes that the volume is already attached when it isn't. because of this we're having big trouble both when removing failed docker hosts and adding new ones.
