BODY : the quantum storage unit no longer plays well with applied energistics 2, because ae has updated to a new type of interface provided by the forge api. quantum storage, on the other hand, is still using the 1.7.10 method for deep storage . however, refined storage _does_ support the old method and the new one, i believe, but am unsure . refined storage is a mod similar to ae2 that has a simpler learning curve read: could be better for people who don't want the complexity of ae2 . it's thematically based largely on ae1, so it isn't totally unfamiliar. it doesn't add world gen, so i was thinking about adding it. for our private server, we could use a rs network in our city hall for the community inventory. it would also let us actually use the qsu blocks with our ae2 setups if we go that route. tagging @moshner to get his input on this. it probably won't go into 2.1 of the pack unless you're fine with it , but i'd like to consider it for 2.2.
