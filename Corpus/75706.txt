 URL : "https://github.com/ebaauw/homebridge-hue/issues/44" TITLE : hue dimmer switch events BODY : because homebridge-hue polls the hue bridge, it cannot detect reliably all buttonevents. e.g. when a button is pressed and released between to heartbeats, homebridge-hue only sees the release buttonevent; but when the button is pressed just before a heartbeat and released just after, homebridge-hue sees both events. to cope with this, homebridge-hue currently only changes the output state of the stateful programmable switch service corresponding to a hue dimmer switch, when a dimmer button is released. this causes the homekit change to happen late, especially when a button is pressed, held for several seconds and then released. homebridge-hue should change the output state as soon as it detects the first event in a press/hold/release series, and not change the state for the next events in the same series.
