 URL : "https://github.com/airr-community/airr-formats/issues/27" TITLE : cdr3 vs junction BODY : just wanted to see what opinions were on whether we should make the mandatory field the cdr3 without conversed residues or the junction cdr3 plus flanking conserved residues . minimal standards went with cdr3, but i don't think they are adverse to changing it. also, i think the nucleotide sequence field should be denote nt instead of na . eg, cdr3_nt instead of cdr3_na . that seems more standard to me. thoughts?
