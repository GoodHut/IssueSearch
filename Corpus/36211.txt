 URL : "https://github.com/badges/shields/issues/1003" TITLE : github star -> stars BODY : the current github badge indicating the number of stars says star . this can be misunderstood since it could indicate that the badge is really another button to star the repository in question while it really is a link to the github repo. i've seen users avoid the link. to prevent this, i would suggest changing star to stars .
