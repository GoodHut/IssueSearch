 URL : "https://github.com/appium/appium-desktop/issues/38" TITLE : how can i use this? BODY : i realize that the readme will be updated when this is ready for use, but i'm struggling to figure out how to use it at all. i have it built and running and i get an electron window that looks like chrome developer tools. in the menus mac , i do not see any options that actually allow me to do anything like point to my app that is running in the simulator. in the javascript console, i tried using the electron api but electron is undefined. i'd like to try using this and make contributions but i don't even understand how it's supposed to work. to be clear, i'm attempting to use the inspector. if there's another way i'm supposed to run that, let me know. i installed and linked appium's npm as indicated and am running the process with npm run dev rather than the release version because it would not build for me. i will investigate that issue if i can get it working at all.
