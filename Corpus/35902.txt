 URL : "https://github.com/api-Hypernova/ac2-game-src/issues/10" TITLE : fix c2s packet delay BODY : client-to-server update rate is forced to 40 updates/sec, as if we're still using dial-up. this also horribly affects demos as it's easy to see from sauerbraten recordings. this rate could/should be set dynamically, unless the client is unable to support a sufficient rate, in which case they should be forced to spectator. the threshold should be added as an svar.
