 URL : "https://github.com/docker-php/docker-php/issues/262" TITLE : about generated files BODY : two things about generated files on 2.0: - re-generate all files per version is maybe quite overkill. maybe it would be better to generate only once with compatible version check on constructor and setters/getters/hassers? btw, maybe we should drop some version support. - generated file should not be versioned. maybe create a script to call on the end-user composer.json to generate the file on install/update command?
