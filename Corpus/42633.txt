 URL : "https://github.com/dain/leveldb/issues/85" TITLE : bug in overlap check? BODY : the somefileoverlapsrange function of level0 class depends on findfile method to find the first file with largest key larger than the target key smallest user key , but the findfile may return the last file in level when no file satisfying the condition. same situation in level class. i guess there may be a bug, but do not confirm that through testing.
