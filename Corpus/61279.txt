 URL : "https://github.com/IBM-i2/Analyze/issues/39" TITLE : analyze 4.1.3 deploying BODY : i think i am misunderstanding developer_essentials_deploying steps for analyze 4.1.3 https://github.com/ibm-i2/analyze/blob/master/documentation/developer_essentials_deploying.md i got stuck at step 8 8.- create a server in eclipse that represents the awc application by repeating the steps above, and creating a server named awc. i previously created a server named i2analyze so creating a new server with the same instance but named awc would create conflicts. how do i create this new server named awc with no conflicts with server i2analyze created previously?
