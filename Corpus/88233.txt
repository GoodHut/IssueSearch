 URL : "https://github.com/Cocoanetics/POEditorAPI/issues/11" TITLE : multiple parallel targets BODY : if you have a localizable.strings in app/resources as well as in widget/resources then the former will be overwritten by the latter. the path in the contexts are widget/resources/en.lproj/localizable.strings and app/resources/en.lproj/localizable.strings i think the best approach would be to always take the entire path, append it to the output folder or empty string to use project root and replace the x.lproj with the name of the individual localisations.
