 URL : "https://github.com/dask-image/dask-ndmeasure/issues/33" TITLE : refactor array joining BODY : there is some code https://github.com/dask-image/dask-ndmeasure/pull/30/files diff-1799b6e9926daa3f6fda9bee52080e9er147 used for joining a bunch of dask arrays contained within a numpy array. might be nice refactor this out into a separate tested internal utility function and add some additional tests for it. alternatively could leverage block once written and vendored.
