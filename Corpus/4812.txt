 URL : "https://github.com/scalda/FoolCraft/issues/216" TITLE : grid power bug BODY : the first time i set down a culinary generator from eu2 it wouldn't run because it said i needed something like 1500 grid power to run. upon restarting my world, i had a few thousand grid power available. i have no gp generation set up. upon running the culinary generator with some cucumber salad, my gp used and max numbers rapidly rose to the numbers pictured. to test it, i spawned in an angel ring and some speed upgrades for the culinary generator, and they function with the proper values, and make use of this massively bugged grid power. ! 2017-04-08 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/27098407/24832787/2d028366-1c7d-11e7-9d1b-da8a6d69fd4f.png ! 2017-04-08 1 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/27098407/24832788/31cf0770-1c7d-11e7-9673-ace92d786e86.png ! 2017-04-08 2 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/27098407/24832789/36939474-1c7d-11e7-9369-8637fc89e79b.png ! 2017-04-08 3 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/27098407/24832791/4464e9e0-1c7d-11e7-9af8-10e912152f74.png
