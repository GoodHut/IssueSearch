 URL : "https://github.com/robustirc/bridge/issues/13" TITLE : add jitter to timers BODY : the original thinking was that connections to the bridge are created at different enough times that requests naturally spread themselves out, but e.g. bridge restarts result in irc clients reconnecting at the same time to the bridge, and hence the bridge sending a bunch of keepalives periodically at the same time. to prevent this, we should add some jitter.
