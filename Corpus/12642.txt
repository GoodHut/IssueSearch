 URL : "https://github.com/MinecraftForge/ForgeGradle/issues/400" TITLE : re: fg not found BODY : @kenzierocks told me to post this. this repository here, https://github.com/me4502/worldedit-sponge-adapters, currently has an issue where fg is not found due to submodules being used. the specific issue is missing fg dep in buildscript classpath. forking decompilation is likely to break. eventually this leads to fernflower not being found, and the decompilation step failing.
