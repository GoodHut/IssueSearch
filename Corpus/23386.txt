 URL : "https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync/issues/502" TITLE : peaking over 0dbfs BODY : hello, thanks for great piece of software, first of all! there may be a bug in audio attenuator in version 3.0.2 and 3.0.1. my setup is: raspberry pi 3 running raspbian 8 -> usb sound blaster sb1095 usbid 041e:30df -> toslink output -> motu 828mk3 hybrid when i run audio from my ipad from itunes/apple music ios9 - mainly heavy mastered dance tracks, i clearly hear peaking/see it on meters on toslink interface - that is, before any software processing. issue goes away after setting maximal volume in config to -2db, note that -1db was not enough - or just lowering volume in ios.
