 URL : "https://github.com/kraih/mojo/issues/1142" TITLE : signatures support again BODY : i've been made aware of filter::signatures https://metacpan.org/pod/filter::signatures recently, and it looks like it might be a reasonable polyfill for signatures https://perldoc.perl.org/perlsub.html signatures on older versions of perl. we should try implementing a new mojo::base flag use mojo::base -base, -signatures; and activate it throughout the mojolicious distribution to see how well it works for non-trivial code bases.
