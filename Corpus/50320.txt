 URL : "https://github.com/SiebenCorgie/jakar-engine/issues/15" TITLE : write shader analyzer BODY : it would be nice to load the shader at compile time to a string, analyse the main shader string and if a special keyword like include is in there use the following name to replace this line with another string aka a shader part. this way i could ensure that input structs are always the same size and the guy who writes the shader also has to write a shader just once. however, atm the structs are set in a .glsl file and the shader-writer has to copy them manually.
