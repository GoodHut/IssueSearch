 URL : "https://github.com/vdm-io/Joomla-Component-Builder/issues/122" TITLE : new subform field BODY : i'm just checking...was the new subform field type supposed to be added to the fieldstype table? checking, because i did the upgrade, and there is no subform field available. it was available in the branch before the merge. i see it in the install sql file though. i'll manually add it, but thought that it would have inserted to the table.
