 URL : "https://github.com/BichenWuUCB/squeezeDet/issues/47" TITLE : pre-training on imagenet BODY : hey, i attempted to pre-train the squeezedet model on imagenet, freeze the first conv layer and then train on kitti but the performance was significantly poorer than that stated in the paper. for imagenet, i trained for ~50 epochs and the validation accuracy reached ~40% and subsequently trained on kitti for 100k iterations. at its highest, the kitti map was approximately 60%. i'm just curious as to the conditions you used for pre-training and whether. thanks!
