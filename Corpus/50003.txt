 URL : "https://github.com/APIs-guru/graphql-voyager/issues/44" TITLE : using as a dependency BODY : graphql-voyager 1.0.0-rc.9 i am trying to use this amazing component in a basic create-react-app but it is stuck on 'transmitting', the schema in the left sider loads fine though. the chrome console logs a 'uncaught syntaxerror: unexpected token <'. here is a repo that reproduces the issue: https://github.com/larskrogjensen/voyager-issue44 the docs state a paragraph that i don't understand: _important: make sure to copy voyager.worker.js from node_modules/graphql-voyager/dist to the same folder as your main bundle._ where in the demo-repo am i supposed to copy the file.
