 URL : "https://github.com/wp-cli/extension-command/issues/18" TITLE : listing dropin plugins BODY : i just had a need to find out whether the db.php dropin plugin was in place on a site, but couldn't do it via wp-cli because dropins aren't listed as part of wp plugin list . i wonder if the command should behave in the same way as the plugins screen in the admin area, whereby you have to go to the dropins tab to see dropin plugins. the wp-cli equivalent would be that you need to pass the dropins status flag to see dropins listed: wp plugin list --status=dropins
