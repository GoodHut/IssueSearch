BODY : just installed aerial on my imac mackintosh but the videos look like they're in 480p quality or something like that. i use a 1440p monitor and thought the videos would be higher quality. i have aerial installed on my late 2016 15 macbook pro and they look like they are scaled correctly for that display. is there something i need to do to make the videos hd or higher resolution on my imac or is this just not how aerial works? sorry if this is a dumb question, maybe i'm just missing something here. thanks.
