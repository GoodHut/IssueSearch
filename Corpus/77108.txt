 URL : "https://github.com/lazymeadow/best-ever-chat/issues/26" TITLE : modals don't scroll well BODY : the modals are getting pretty big especially the settings one . chat 2.0 pulls the settings modal into two, but adding more settings will still have this issue. if information/change log from issue 22 is in a modal, that's going to be long, too. the modal body not the header or footer need to be the part that is scrolling. the header and footer should be consistent in their location. this should hopefully be a css change.
