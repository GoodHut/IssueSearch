 URL : "https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/2441" TITLE : entry realm definition BODY : https://html.spec.whatwg.org/ entry > with this in hand, we define the entry execution context to be the most recently pushed entry in the javascript execution context stack whose entrance counter value is greater than zero\. the entry realm is the entry execution context's realm component\. is there some way that an execution context that has an entrance counter greater than zero from before can be pushed onto the javascript execution context stack without an accompanying entrance counter increment, and thus at that point become the current entry execution context without being explicitly entered ? i'm inclined to think that this should not happen; that entry realm changes should only happen at the points where the entrance counter is now incremented/decremented, effectively. so i think one of these things are wrong: 1. my understanding of the definition above 2. my understanding of how things should actually work 3. the definition above
