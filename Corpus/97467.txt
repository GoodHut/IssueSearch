 URL : "https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme/issues/765" TITLE : gtkscale incorrectly hides BODY : installed using package arc-theme-1488477732.766ae1a-71.1.noarch from repo: http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/horst3180/fedora_25/ distro: fedora 25 gtk+ 3.22.11 currently the gtkscale widget is hidden if its associated gtkadjustment's lower and upper bounds is equal. according to documentation: note that using the same upper and lower bounds for the gtkscale through the gtkrange methods will hide the slider itself. according to gtkrange.c in gtk_range_calc_slider function line 3646 : gtk_css_gadget_set_visible priv->slider_gadget, visible ; so from this i expect only the slider to be shown/hidden and not the whole gtkscale widget. this can not be reproduced with adwaita. so it must be a arc theme bug.
