 URL : "https://github.com/w3c/jlreq/issues/12" TITLE : list style type. BODY : in css list style type property, it is possible to specify the use of cjk-ideographic, hiragana, hiragana-iroha, katakana, and katakana-iroha as ordered list marker. however, the result of these options as i see from chrome browser is like this: ! image https://i.imgur.com/zsl3xdi.png which have normal western dot behind each characters. as i understand, this is not a common way to write this type of list in japanese. should it be specified in jlreq that this sort of lists usually use the symbol „ÄÅ instead? and perhaps also need to contact various browser vendors and such for this?
