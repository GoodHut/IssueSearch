 URL : "https://github.com/jakirkham/docker_centos_drmaa_conda/issues/34" TITLE : add and use non-root user BODY : currently we are making use of a root user as it ended up being easier to configure than a non- root user with sge. however, we should transition to a non- root user. this will require some tweaking of the entrypoint script and configuration of sge, but will ultimately be for the best.
