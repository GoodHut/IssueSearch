 URL : "https://github.com/schemaspy/schemaspy/issues/33" TITLE : specifying the renderer BODY : thank you for taking up maintenance of the schemaspy project. i've been using it for a few years, and it definitely needs some finishing up. a recent update to graphviz seems to have broken it for me on osx. i thought i'd try your version to see if it fixes the issue, but it suffers from the same problem. when generating a diagram, we get errors like these: .net.sourceforge.schemaspy.util.dot$dotfailure: 'dot -tpng:gd /users/stebro/build/scan_priority.1degree.dot -o/users/stebro/build/scan_priority.1degree.png -tcmapx' failed with return code 139 running that command directly from the command line also fails with a segfault . talking to the graphviz guys, it turns out there's something not right about the gd rendering library on our machines, but schemaspy works correctly with the cairo renderer, so this command succeeds: dot -tpng /users/stebro/build/scan_priority.1degree.dot -o/users/stebro/build/scan_priority.1degree.png -tcmapx note the absence of :gd on the -t flag . i'm not a java developer, but in scanning through the code config.java it looks like theres an option, -renderer , that governs the behavior of what goes into the -t option, but i cannot get it to work, e.g., invoking schemaspy with -renderer png , -renderer cairo or -renderer png:cairo doesn't do anything but doesn't give me an error for an unknown command line option . any ideas?
