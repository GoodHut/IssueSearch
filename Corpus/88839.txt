 URL : "https://github.com/OdatNurd/OverrideAudit/issues/6" TITLE : override: date inspection BODY : perform an inspection to check to see if any overrides in use are out of date due to their being older than the files that they are overriding. this would work not only for a complete override but also single unpacked override files. the report should call out overrides which may need to be rethought/recreated/removed so as not to block incoming changes. generate report on demand via command palette/menu generate report when plugin is loaded i.e. at startup of sublime generate report once per day for extended sessions hook into package control if installed and generate report for specific package s updated or installed that last one i'm going to say is optional because i'm not sure if it's possible to do something like that at the moment. my vague understanding is that i may only be able to detect when my own plugin is being updated and not someone else's but i am not sure.
