 URL : "https://github.com/MISP/MISP/issues/2689" TITLE : sightings ui improvements BODY : currently any advanced sighting addition/modification must be done one at a time. there is no easy way to undo a sighting without opening the advanced menu. some possible improvements, as brainstormed in gitter with @iglocska: the sightings ui for sightings on individual attributes could be improved to allow for new features: - quickly delete sightings - add/modify the total number of sightings/false positives reported for that attribute bulk an option to implement this would be: - make the numbers in the sightings column links that open a context pop-up floating div . - in this pop-up, a text area allows to modify manually the total number of sightings/fp reported by you. - a red x button allows to remove all sightings. also, another improvement that is not directly related but that would make it more clear for users the correct way to use sightings: - include in the icon tooltip a more elaborate description of what the thumb-up and thumb-down button means and when to use it.
