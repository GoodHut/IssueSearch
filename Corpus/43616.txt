 URL : "https://github.com/karbonfm/fm-json-validation/issues/2" TITLE : custom function issue BODY : when copying custom functions into a new file i noticed they broke. it looks like json.validate was supposed to take a path and json object for error. please double check this is the case. i have created a new custom function that throws an error object literally json with errorcode: -2 . before i include this function i want to make sure it actually solves a problem.
