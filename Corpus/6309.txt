 URL : "https://github.com/dmtrKovalenko/material-ui-pickers/issues/71" TITLE : add .nvmrc file BODY : hello! thanks for the package, it's a huge time saver. it would be a really nice feature if this package leveraged use of a .nvmrc https://github.com/creationix/nvm nvmrc config. out of the box, i currently get 7 failed tests and a handful of errors and warnings because of a different node version. i'd be happy to submit a pr with the change. what are your thoughts?
