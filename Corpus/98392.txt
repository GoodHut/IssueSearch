 URL : "https://github.com/hibtc/madqt/issues/2" TITLE : internal handling of units BODY : so far i'm using a unit library pint to add units to numbers obtained from madx/tao partially implemented . the idea was that all quantities the application handles internally and which the user can access always have proper units. however, removing+readding units from numbers drags through a lot of the application in a very unclean way such that i was long beginning to wonder whether we should just convert all units on i/o to a defined standard and internally only store numbers.
