 URL : "https://github.com/kentsommer/keras-posenet/issues/2" TITLE : hardware used for training BODY : i recently came across posenet and tried to experiment with it. i modified the original architecture of posenet and now my input layer size is 1x100x224x224x3 where 1 is the batch size and 100 are the frames. actually i have implemented lstm version of posenet. now i have tried to run training on my own data, first on gtx750 and then on quadro k1200 4 gb gpu with tensorflow backend for keras i am using posenet,written in keras and also tried theano backend but everytime i get out of memory error. i want to ask what hardware specs your computer had on which you ran your training?
