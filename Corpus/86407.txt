 URL : "https://github.com/w0rp/ale/issues/1067" TITLE : how to configure a linter BODY : i would like to configure the python mypy tool to include the option --ignore-missing-imports , how would i do this? i can see you can define specific linters to be run: viml let g:ale_linters = { \ 'javascript': 'eslint' , \} but i'm not sure how to modify that behaviour. with neomake you could do something like the following: viml let g:neomake_python_mypy_args = neomake makers ft python mypy 'args' + '--ignore-missing-imports'
