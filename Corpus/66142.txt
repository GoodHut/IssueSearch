 URL : "https://github.com/pret/pokeruby/issues/428" TITLE : map editor integration. BODY : currently, one of the problems with not having an approachable dissassembly is that no gen 3 map editors support integration with pokeruby. this will also apply to other gen 3 dissassemblies in the future. how do we wanna do this? refactor maps/ ? add json files to tell the editor where to look?
