 URL : "https://github.com/ActianCorp/SC930_Tools/issues/1" TITLE : sorting is not working BODY : i'm running the tool over a bunch of sc930 output files 106 in total , using the gui display, and although i can get the lrq data, the results are not presented in sorted order. is the sort option supposed to work in the gui display, or only from the command-line ? it would be equally handy in the gui to present the results in ascending or descending order, and this is implied by the checkbox on 'sort results'.
