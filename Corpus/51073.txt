 URL : "https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/issues/8260" TITLE : add package code alias BODY : we have package codes e.g. so8 but sometimes customers or suppliers write them a bit differently like so-8 or they call it soic8 or soic-8 . for this we need to be able to add package code alias as a child table in package code . please make sure that when you create a new package code it is checked if there is an alias already to prevent adding a package code that is listed as an alias and please when adding package code show the aliases and make them searchable so we find the right package code.
