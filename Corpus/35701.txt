 URL : "https://github.com/eqrion/cbindgen/issues/66" TITLE : expand test coverage BODY : right now there are some minimal tests under compile-tests/ . i'd really like to improve the testing coverage. some ideas: 1. integrate with cargo test 2. check in compile-tests/ generated headers so we can track syntactic changes over time 3. add crate-tests/ which would test cbindgen on crates instead of single source files 4. just add more tests
