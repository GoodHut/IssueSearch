 URL : "https://github.com/CastXML/CastXML/issues/90" TITLE : packaging into nixos BODY : i wonder if you could push the git tags to github. first it allows for users to quickly see what's the latest version from the github interface, i like it , secondly it also makes for a nicer revision to see when packaging for nixos. it typically looks like that src = fetchfromgithub { owner = castxml ; repo = castxml ; rev = ${version} ; sha256 = 1mvn0z1vl4j9drl3dsw2dv0pppqvj29d2m07487dzzi8cbxrqj36 ; }; and i want to package castxml for nixos nixos.org , a source-based linux distribution
