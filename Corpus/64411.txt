 URL : "https://github.com/rdfinn/genome-properties/issues/10" TITLE : genprop0039 - hmm_clust BODY : the final step in genprop0039 is an hmm-clust - do we calculate this atm? from the release notes: the method hmm-clust allows an overly broad hmm to identify proteins likely to belong to a system when they co-cluster within 3000 bp with other proteins from the same genomeproperty that were identified by the method hmm . i have added the ipr for the pfam given as evidence for this hmm-clust step - but it is a domain rather than a family. this domain does match to non-mammals.
