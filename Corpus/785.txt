 URL : "https://github.com/lopezfjose/fortran-linear-regression/issues/1" TITLE : n off by 1 BODY : the overall element count is off by one. it says 1001 when it should be 1000 when analyzing input2.dat. as a result, the linear regression values slope and y-intercept are off slightly. not enough to give a wrong answer to two decimal places, but i need to find that bug. or maybe i'm just exhausted, i haven't slept in like 20 hours.
