 URL : "https://github.com/torchbox/wagtail-markdown/issues/26" TITLE : trouble with bleach BODY : i'm deploying on heroku using python 3.6.3 but i'm getting an error: collecting wagtail-markdown==0.4.1 from -r /tmp/build_e2d694b32c1dc181c4b75586ee858300/requirements.txt line 49 could not find a version that satisfies the requirement wagtail-markdown==0.4.1 from -r /tmp/build_e2d694b32c1dc181c4b75586ee858300/requirements.txt line 49 from versions: no matching distribution found for wagtail-markdown==0.4.1 from -r /tmp/build_e2d694b32c1dc181c4b75586ee858300/requirements.txt line 49 when i run pip install wagtail-markdown && pip freeze > requirements.txt it downgrades my bleach from version 2.1.1 to version 1.4.2, which breaks my html5lib.sanitizer i tried to upgrade bleach to fix that, as shown here: https://github.com/ckan/ckan/issues/3257 then when requirements are installed on deployment bleach gets downgraded automatically due to wagtail-markdown's requirements. can we bump up the bleach requirement here?
