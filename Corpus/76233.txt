 URL : "https://github.com/hseeberger/reactive-flows/issues/16" TITLE : introduce event adapters BODY : currently we use custom serializers to detach the domain model case classes for messages and events from the serialization format case classes generated by scalapb . the same could probably be achieved by using event adapters. these offer a clearer separation of concerns transformation, serialization and might lead to an easier implementation by using generic serializers.
