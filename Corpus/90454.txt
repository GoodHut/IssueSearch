 URL : "https://github.com/igoradamenko/postcss-url-mapper/issues/10" TITLE : should we change the api? BODY : i'm not sure, but for me current api is shitty. it seems like we should: 1. pass to the map function not only a name of a property, but a type too: at-rule, property, variable and so on. 2. pass to the map function full property and short. where 'full' is exactly the same as in the css, but 'short' is a property without vendor prefixes, e.g. --webkit-mask & mask . 3. pass arguments as an option object, like fn { url, type, name, property } instead of fn url, type, name, property . buuut, i'm not using the package in my current projects. so i can't decide by myself. and if you are using it right now, please, tell me what you think about all of the thoughts above.
