 URL : "https://github.com/ArduCAM/Arduino/issues/180" TITLE : async ov2640 stream BODY : having some trouble getting the server stream and other html elements working at the same time and looking for some direction or advice on the best way to implement the stream and other html elements on the same page such that button and sliders are not blocked while streaming. at the moment if the stream is started server.on /stream , http_get, serverstream ; then web socket events will not fire. the html, javascript, web socket and web server are all on the esp and the client connects via ddns address. have been trying to get the espasyncwebserver working with the arducam but am having trouble sending the responses for example void serverstream { string response = http/1.1 200 ok\r ; response += content-type: multipart/x-mixed-replace; boundary=frame\r \r ; server.sendcontent response ; ....... if !client.connected break; response = --frame\r ; response += content-type: image/jpeg\r \r ; server.sendcontent response ; ........ } to void serverstream asyncwebserverrequest request { request->send 200, text/plain , http/1.1 200 ok\r content-type: multipart/x-mixed-replace; boundary=frame\r \r ; .... request->send 200, text/plain , --frame\r content-type: image/jpeg\r \r ; ..... } i feel like i am missing something obvious here, i would have thought a button _onclick_ or slider _onchnage_ web socket events while the video is streaming would be a common implementation. any advice would be great.
