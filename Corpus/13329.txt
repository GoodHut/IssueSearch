 URL : "https://github.com/Indicia-Team/warehouse/issues/270" TITLE : travis ci issues BODY : since this summer, the travis ci builds have been failing. although i've managed to get the builds to pass again, there are a few issues which are worth noting and attempting to fix at some point. 1. postgresql needs to be reinstalled otherwise the postgis extension won't work. see https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/6972. 2. the builds only work on the precise environment, not the trusty environment which is now the default. on trusty any curl calls to the web services fail saying the path is not found. 3. the home test case needs to be run twice, the first time it applies scripts which update core, the 2nd time it updates the modules. i don't know why this does not happen in a single hit.
