 URL : "https://github.com/chupakabra1996/recommendation-engine/issues/2" TITLE : get the user from session BODY : in the current implementation to get the user data we have to make database request by principal. for example: @getmapping /user public string showuser principal principal { // making database query findbylogin principal.getname } so, maybe, i can use session to store some part of user details email, name, etc. . what do you think?
