 URL : "https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/issues/540" TITLE : process prolog and epilog BODY : the goal of this enhancement is to add two new process directives, namely: prolog and epilog that would make it possible to add to process task a common script prefix and suffix. these are different from beforescript https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html beforescript and afterscript https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html afterscript directives that are designed mainly for custom task configuration and, above all, are execute in the task wrapper context, that can be a separated environment from the task execution one in particular when using containers . instead prolog content should be prepended to the user script just after the shebang declaration and epilog should appended to the user task script.
