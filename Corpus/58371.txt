 URL : "https://github.com/jayrbolton/metadat/issues/2" TITLE : sharing dats privately BODY : - user a requests to be a contact with user b - both users generate new dats that hold metadata specifically for their relationship what private dats they want to share w eachother - both users encrypt the addresses of these dats using each other's pubkeys and temporarily place those encrypted addresses in their own public metadats - each user decrypts each other's contact metadat address and then saves the address privately on their own device. - whenever user a wants to share a dat privately with user b, they save the dat address inside the relationship dat that they have for user b. user b reads that address and it shows up in the ui. so the only downside is that there's a temporary file the encrypted address that could indicate to the public that a contact request is pending maybe it could be pretty obfuscated though . the upside is no-one will ever be able to read the full list of your contacts, and nobody would ever have a clue about what you're sharing with whom.
