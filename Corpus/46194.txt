 URL : "https://github.com/ethereum/populus/issues/415" TITLE : lll: support literals BODY : what is wrong? this is more of a reminder for myself. no action necessary. literal support was not included in pr 408 as i didn't consider parsing assembly output from lllc - just the source and its cleaned-up tree. pr was also getting too big. detecting literals in output from lllc -a should be simple with some globs/regexes: they are printed at the particular place and with the specific value as where they'll appear in compiled bytecode. it should therefore be simple to strip the bytecode of those and only those that appear in deployment-only code when generating runtime bytecode from regular lllc -x output. cute animal picture ! https://i.pinimg.com/736x/95/3b/71/953b719404df6ee4633be74d9186debf.jpg
