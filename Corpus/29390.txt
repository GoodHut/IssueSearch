 URL : "https://github.com/linvi/tweetinvi/issues/482" TITLE : list id must be set BODY : i am using tweetinvi to get the tweets from a twitter list. for some reason, when i try to do so, i get an exception thrown with the message list id must be set . i've followed the documentation and i can't see anything wrong with how i'm using it. this is how my code looks: auth.setusercredentials <consumerkey>,<consumersecret>,<twitteraccesstoken>,<twitteraccesstokensecret> ; var list = twitterlist.getexistinglist durham , nclairport ; it should return this list: https://twitter.com/nclairport/lists/durham any ideas on how to get this working?
