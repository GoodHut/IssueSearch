 URL : "https://github.com/johnrengelman/shadow/issues/282" TITLE : user guide unavailable BODY : the user guide hosted on your own site is sending too many redirects. i see gh_pages, but trying to navigate to https://johnrengelman.github.io/shadow starts doing those redirects again. it would be nice if https://johnrengelman.github.io/shadow worked so the uptime of your personal site didn't affect people's ability to use the software.
