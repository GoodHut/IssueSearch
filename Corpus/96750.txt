 URL : "https://github.com/oblitum/Interception/issues/55" TITLE : filter individual devices? BODY : is it technically feasible to allow filters to be per-device? ideally, i would like to reduce the amount of processing that my code needs to do, and also it would be nice if i could debug code filtering one keyboard and mouse, but still operate the debugger with another keyboard and mouse.
