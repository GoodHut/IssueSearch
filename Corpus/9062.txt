 URL : "https://github.com/cweagans/composer-patches/issues/173" TITLE : tag new release BODY : it would be awesome to get a new tagged release on 1.x now that this critical bug has been resolved: https://github.com/cweagans/composer-patches/pull/165 without a tagged release, the only way downstream projects blt, lightning can get that fix is by using the 1.x-dev branch, which isn't really good practice for a distributed project.
