 URL : "https://github.com/neonobjclash/fp2bugs/issues/109" TITLE : crystal speed boost BODY : this bug works with any character. if you exit a slope like, say, the slope at the begining of dragon valley, after going through the vines at high speeds, without jumping, and then land on a crystal the kind that gives more crystals when broken with an attack , you´ll go boosting to the right at high speeds. this even works when there´s no horizontal movement, or even when you try to go to the left when landing on the crystal. this could lead if possible to characters phasing through walls and even ignore enemies entirely, rendering the battles mechanic mute.
