 URL : "https://github.com/DonZoeggerle/ediFabric/issues/70" TITLE : isa in nm1 segment BODY : as with issues 67 and 69, in the 835 format though i don't think the format matters any name with isa as part of it clarisa, lisa, isaac in the nm1 segment causes the x12reader to start processing a new control segment in place, thus aborting the remainder of the file. it doesn't seem likely that a new control segment would occur without the previous segment having the segment termination character so this doesn't seem like correct behavior. you indicated that this was addressed in 7.3.1, but my tests still fail with that new build so i'm not sure which aspect of the behavior was handled. i'll be glad to send more test cases along if they help. thanks!
