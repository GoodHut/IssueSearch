 URL : "https://github.com/jonseddon/cmip6-cmor-tables/issues/16" TITLE : prim1hrpt table name BODY : hi @mpmoine after looking at 15 i checked the other primavera time point tables. there are a mixture of cell_methods in the prim1hrpt table e.g. time mean, point, maximum and minimum . rather than splitting this table into two tables, we propose that this should be renamed to prim1hr and to keep all of the 1 hour variables in this table. i am just doing a final check of the v1.0.2 data request and i will send this out by the end of friday with all of these corrections. i will try to add in the v1.0.3 changes too, although these are minimal. thanks, jon
