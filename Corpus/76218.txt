 URL : "https://github.com/boutproject/BOUT-dev/issues/509" TITLE : intel compiler and c++11 BODY : the intel compiler, even quite recent versions 16.0.1 20151021 does not set the __cplusplus macro to 201103l, so fails in configure when the macro on line of 144 configure.ac ax_cxx_compile_stdcxx 11 , noext , mandatory tries to compile a code with the lines elif __cplusplus < 201103l error this is not a c++11 compiler see this old thread: https://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/intel-c-compiler/topic/286974 not sure what the solution is: we could check for the features we need, fix the macro, or make the check non-mandatory so when it fails configure keeps going.
