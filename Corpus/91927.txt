 URL : "https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-playground/issues/230" TITLE : urgent: semver versioning BODY : sorry for the caps in the title, but _please_ respect semver versioning. you completely removed the playground from graphql-playground-middleware in favor of separate packages per server type from 1.1.2 to 1.1.3 . all package managers will update from 1.1.2 to 1.1.3 silently because it is not expected to have breaking changes. 1.1.3 should have been 1.2.0 at least, but actually 2.0.0 according to semver, so _all_ existing examples don't break when someone installs them!!!
