 URL : "https://github.com/Dynatrace/superdump/issues/21" TITLE : idea: interactive mode BODY : __motivation:__ in order to seriously debug a crash dump, which does not reveal it's real reason from a superdump report, one must still download the crash dump, start a debugging tool e.g. windbg, gdb and investgate further. for windows users, who need to debug linux crash dumps and vice versa , this is painful. also, some setup stuff always needs to be prepared e.g. correct symbol path . what if superdump offered a web-based console which allows for interactive debugging? __goal:__ on a crash report page, offer a button for interactive mode . it would show a console window in the browser. in the background, superdumpservice would actually start a process e.g. cdb.exe, gdb , load the given crash dump maybe do other preparation steps and redirect input/output to the console window. technically, it would make sense to start the process in a docker-container to protect the outer environment.
