 URL : "https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/Simple-Calendar/issues/193" TITLE : caldav sync missing BODY : this app now can sync with google calendar, however it does not schoes all calendars configured in google calendar. rather than adding gsync support i'd like so have caldav supported so owncloud/nextcloud and others that support caldav could be used. btw, rather than reinbent the wheel implementig calendar sync, why don't you just let the app use the standard android calendar store, so the sync can be done with 3rd party apps like davdroid or acaldav? that's the way it works for other calendar apps as well.
