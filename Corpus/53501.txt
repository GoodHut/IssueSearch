 URL : "https://github.com/fastslack/jUpgradePro/issues/24" TITLE : duplicate menu aliases BODY : i have lots of duplicate aliases in menus, so jupgrade hangs on migrating menus. i corrected a few aliases added 2 at the end of duplicated ones , tried to run jupgrade, it hanged again. i checked - a few more menus were imported. then i corrected all aliases to be unique, but jupgrade imports 32 menu items and hangs again. i am using the latest git version.
