 URL : "https://github.com/bugcrowd/vulnerability-rating-taxonomy/issues/107" TITLE : add source code disclosure BODY : source code disclosure vulnerabilities do not neatly fit into one of the existing vulnerabilities, and come up often enough that i believe they deserve their own title. i think it should be a subcategory of the sensitive data disclosure category. the vulnerability can often lead to the disclosure of secrets, comments, configuration settings, employee information, and internal system information, as well as sometimes allowing further vulnerabilities to be more easily discovered. i'm not sure on the default priority, it could be from a 2 to a 4. it is more sensitive than descriptive stack trace which is a 5, as the source code implies a stack trace and more. thank you.
