 URL : "https://github.com/kc5nra/CLRBrowserSourcePlugin/issues/3" TITLE : updating chromium version BODY : hi, i'm working with a client currently that, due to technical issues is stuck on obs classic. i'm just curious if there's any chance, either a new build can be put together with an updated chromium version - or if you'd be able to provide a base how-to on updating it. i was looking through the source code here but can't see any references. thanks
