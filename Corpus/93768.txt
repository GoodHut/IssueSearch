 URL : "https://github.com/lainsce/quilter/issues/84" TITLE : app icon slightly too tall BODY : quilter has a great sense of style, but the app icon is a few pixels taller than almost every other app's. it seems especially jarring next to notejot, but it doesn't matter what app i put quilter next to, it's taller than almost all of them. ideally the app would be the same height as scratch. ! quiltericon https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32748700/31515375-f920f478-af62-11e7-99d8-6b3279767c78.png
