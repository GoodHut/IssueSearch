 URL : "https://github.com/Robert8944/sqsg6/issues/12" TITLE : test for visual errors BODY : with changes to css files and html edits may have left visual errors and css bugs in site pages. button placement, text alignment, and other visual issues may exist in areas untested or when viewed on different devices with different screen sizes. to test, each page should be opened on standard desktop resolutions 1280 x 768 1920 x 1080 3000 x 2000 and should be viewed in partials of these resolutions, manipulating window size until the container size reductions are triggered. these pages should also be viewed on mobile devices with firefox and chrome mobile browsers. these viewport changes should be reflected in previous viewport settings, but mobile browsers may reveal other view errors triggered by html issues in these mobile browsers.
