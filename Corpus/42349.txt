 URL : "https://github.com/coreos/etcd/issues/8287" TITLE : auth token expiration BODY : hello, i am writing a node.js client for etcd and i am in middle of implementing the authentication part. my question is after the authenticate call when does the auth token expires ? what is the criteria for expiration , is it based on duration of the token or how long the client remains idle ? in case, the expiration is based on the period for which client remains idle, should i send regular requests to keep the token alive ? will the token still expire if i have a watch or a lease since it's a streaming rpc my apologies if my questions are dumb, i am new to world of etcd
