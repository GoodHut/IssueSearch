 URL : "https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/587" TITLE : linking on windows BODY : it would be nice if the readme explained how to compile this on windows. as it stands i either get ld: cannot find -lpq or and equivalent error for pq.lib depending on whether i'm using the -msvc or -gnu toolchains. it actually fails when compiling diesel_codegen . i installed postgresql using the bigsql windows installer, and it put libpq.a and libpq.dll in c:\program files\postgresql\pg96\lib but i have no idea how to tell cargo to look there and google did not help.
