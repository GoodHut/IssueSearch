 URL : "https://github.com/bitwarden/browser/issues/220" TITLE : not filling popup screen BODY : bitwarden is not filling popup windows. for example, my router has a popup for logging in, but bitwarden cannot fill it. same for some other sites that have a popup login. bitwarden just sits there, a right click does nothing. i have to cancel the popup login screen, or manually input the login credentials.
