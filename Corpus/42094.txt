 URL : "https://github.com/jennybc/reprex/issues/74" TITLE : adding traceback info BODY : i asked a question about whether to add traceback-output during the ropensci community call https://ropensci.org/blog/blog/2017/02/17/comm-call-v13 and @jennybc asked me to open an issue. so here it is :cake: what i imagine could look like the sessioninfo tab, that one can open if they want to. i.e. something like reprex::reprex rnorm 10 , venue = gh , si = true, tb = true where additionally to the session-info-tab there will also appear a traceback-tab. the question came to me because i was asked to add the traceback in an issue i recently opened: https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr/issues/1490
