 URL : "https://github.com/xBimTeam/XbimEssentials/issues/82" TITLE : versions on github BODY : hello. i am particularly interested in the xbim project. our company would like to use it, if we are able to run the sample project and then validate it to use. but unfortunately for the moment this is not the case, the sample project contains some syntax errors, which when corrected, makes a more delicate problem appear: it requires version 4.0.28-v013, and n ' never arrives to update it since github ... so what can we do? i have registered on myget, but for the moment, i still can not argue with the supplement nuget this source of package ... by the way, if we download it, nuget does not recognize this package as compliant. .it's very annoying.
