 URL : "https://github.com/pdmangel/node-red-contrib-openhab2/issues/12" TITLE : unable to select item BODY : this intially worked but now i'm unable to see any items in the item dropdown, if i look at any already configured nodes they all work interacting with the openhab item and if i edit the flows_openhab2.json and fill out the item manually there it works, but from the ui i can not see any items. any idea what would be keeping it from viewing / selecting a list if items yet the binding continues to function normally.
