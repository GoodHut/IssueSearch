 URL : "https://github.com/SimplaElements/simpla-collection/issues/5" TITLE : custom item previews BODY : simpla collection should have a way to customise the item previews in the editor sidebar. right now it's quite difficult for the user to figure out which rendered item an icon in the editor corresponds to, and virtually impossible in large collections. the collection itself can't guess much better than it already does for previews, since it's just given an arbitrary template to work with. instead, simpla-collection should make a second template available to developers, to specify preview markup. html <simpla-collection path= /gallery > <template> <div> <img is= simpla-img path= /gallery/ item /img > <simpla-text path= /gallery/ item /caption ></simpla-text> </div> </template> <template data-item-preview> <img is= simpla-img path= gallery/ item /img style= width: 100% > </template> </simpla-collection any simpla elements used in previews would be forced to be non-editable and have pointer events disabled, so they can still render data from the collection but not be intereacted with. it would be up to the developer to ensure that their preview template acts in a sane manner in simpla-collection's edit sidebar, with styles defined inline.
