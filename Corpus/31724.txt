 URL : "https://github.com/maxogden/simplify-geojson/issues/10" TITLE : support es6 modules BODY : modules don't allow exporting the whole module as a function in es6: https://github.com/microsoft/typescript/issues/5867 issuecomment-161119689 my suggestion for a fix is to export the function from the module instead of exporting the function as the module.
