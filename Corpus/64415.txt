 URL : "https://github.com/transistorsoft/cordova-background-geolocation-lt/issues/462" TITLE : geofencing arrow on ios BODY : we are using this plugin solely for background geofencing. therefore an ios user would expect the app to generate the geofencing arrow the outline rather than the location arrow solid . is there a way to set the app to provide just that? or doesn't that work due to the way the plugin works?
