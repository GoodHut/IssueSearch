 URL : "https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema/issues/217" TITLE : natural typing timing? BODY : i asked myself whether there already is a tool that can postprocess a asciinema json to make it look like manually typed in. a borgbackup contributor recently made new asciinema recordings and he found a nice way to enter a lot of text, avoiding typos: he first entered them into the shell without asciinema recording it and then, while asciinema was recording, he just used some autocompletion/history recall feature of the shell so he just needed to manually type the first few characters and then the rest was completed from the shell's memory. while that is a nice hack, it has one drawback: the first few chars look manually typed and then whoosh all the rest of that line comes in in a blast. looks strange and also speed-wise sometimes difficult to read. one issue with such a post-processing might be to actually know what was echoed from the keyboard and what was output generated by the shell - is there some way to know that?
