_originally opened as https://github.com/cqui-org/cqui/issues/313_ ---- despite having cleaned up the plot tooltips already, they're still a bit of an eyefull. i think this tooltip could benefit greatly from some selective italics and coloring. for example: color-coding strategic/luxury resources so they're easier to tell apart at a glance and to spot in the middle of all that info. the descriptive text could also use some styling to make it easier to distinguish the demarcation point between the labels and info. e.g: movement cost: 2 -> _movement cost:_ 2 see here for more info https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/cqui-a-qui-spinoff-v0-6-out.602771/page-21 post-14660182
