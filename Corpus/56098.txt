 URL : "https://github.com/celery/librabbitmq/issues/96" TITLE : memory leak on smartos BODY : hi, i have an issue with using this library with celery on smartos. the memory usage is gradually building up when connection to amqp server is unavailable. the solution for my project was to not use librabbitmq library and use the amqp library. i tried version downloaded from pypi, the same version built manually, and also the latest librabbitmq version from here. i understand that the forked rabbitmq-c version is quite outdated, although i didn't manage to build this library with any newer rabbitmq-c version. details: librabbitmq version 1.6.1 and the latest master celery version 3.1.25 smartos build 20170624t192838z
