 URL : "https://github.com/FireFly-WoW/FireFly-IssueTracker/issues/429" TITLE : quest: the cleansing BODY : description. the quest can be completed but with a few things not in place. no buff, and extra spawns. current behaviour: 1. on the way up frostblade peak i noticed this on my way up the mountain path. a enemy should not appear here. inner turmoil . 2. i saw two spawns here, when it should only have been one. 3. once the ritual is completed up the top near the frostblade shrine you dont get the buff. expected behaviour: there should only be 1 spawn at the top of the peak once you activated the frostblade shrine. you should also get a levitate buff once for a short duration once you have completed it. steps to reproduce the problem: get the quest the cleansing 2. move up the mountain frostblade peak by following the road. activate the shrine. 3. confirm the extra adds , and no buff. screenshots: http://imgur.com/a/v3sncurl... url...
