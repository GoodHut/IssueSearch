 URL : "https://github.com/mmouterde/FlexyTrello/issues/30" TITLE : column width bug BODY : chrome v58.0.3029.96 64-bit flexytrello v1.3.6 i have not enabled persistence. if you widen a column to 2, and then the page is refreshed, or you change boards, the column returns to 1 which is expected without persistence . however, when you widen it to 2 again, it actually skips 2 and goes to 3. this is reproducible. you can avoid this by manually sizing the column back to 1 before leaving the board/refreshing, and then it expands normally.
