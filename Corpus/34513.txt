 URL : "https://github.com/FeedTheCube/CogDoc/issues/7" TITLE : class error handling BODY : @sinclairc i haven't provided any error handling when building the classes. i will probably need you to take a crack at a class like query which we may want to provide some break-points for. if you could at least provide me an example of how/why we'd do things like try/catch and how we gracefully capture the errors to report to the user. it would be especially useful if we could do this as or follow-up with a working session to help me understand. in this sample, the query may or may not have a child called detailedfilters . if it doesn't, perhaps we could provide some sort of feedback to the user stating as much.
