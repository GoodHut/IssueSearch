BODY : dear sirs i am really a novice of rubocop. when i try auto-correct a part of code ruby 3.times{|i| if pos_i i ==1.0 or pos_j i ==1.0 bias = 1.0 else bias = 0.0 end bias = pos_i i ==1.0 or pos_j i ==1.0 ? 1.0 : 0.0 } by the command, rubocop --auto-correct test.rb the rubocop did ruby 3.times { |i| bias = if pos_i i == .0 || pos_j i == .0 1.0 else 0.0 end bias = pos_i i ==1.0 or pos_j i ==1.0 ? 1.0 : 0.0 } the values in the if-condition were incorrectly translated. is this ok? i know i was nuts on the comparison with the floating point... a very old code i wrote...
