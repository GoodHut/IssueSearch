 URL : "https://github.com/gabriel-detassigny/kodi-angular/issues/4" TITLE : library for pictures BODY : hi guys i'd like to adapt this remote. i'd like an additional library page for pictures png files only . i need all png files listed that are in the connected folders. i already figured out how to add a page with path for this and how to adapt the code and rebuild the app with grunt. planned to scoop the methods used in the music.js service and adapt to get this running for png's. the thing is, i'm not getting any music files in the list either, even if i place an mp3 file in the shared folder. i'm completely new to angular, any pointers would be more than welcome.
