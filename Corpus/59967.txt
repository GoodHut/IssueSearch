 URL : "https://github.com/slawrence/simple-360-player/issues/2" TITLE : video rendering issues BODY : i tried replacing the sample video link with my own. this repeatedly throws a non-power-of-2 texture render warning in chrome and goes on to never load the video. the same warning also appears with the default video but stops at some point. usually after ~40 times. here's the error: .offscreen-for-webgl-0x7fa441a00200 render warning: texture bound to texture unit 0 is not renderable. it maybe non-power-of-2 and have incompatible texture filtering.
