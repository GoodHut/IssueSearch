 URL : "https://github.com/xbmc/Kore/issues/419" TITLE : ability to play a disc BODY : i can control playback of an audio cd through kore just fine, but i can't actually select the cd for playing from the kore ui, other than using the remote to navigate through the screen menus. it'd be great if instead i could use the kore app to start playback of a cd.
