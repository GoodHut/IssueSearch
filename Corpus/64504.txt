 URL : "https://github.com/alexarchambault/coursier/issues/458" TITLE : give scala-native a try BODY : it should be possible to have a workish scala-native command-line tool, by taking a few shortcuts. it'd be interesting to compare the perf of such a tool to its jvm counterpart. among the points to address / circumvent: - use scalaz 7.3.0-m10 hoping the sources of coursier are fine with it , - don't depend on fastparse, which doesn't seem to be compiled for scala-native temporary, only used to parse ivy patterns - either remove support for ivy repos, or use an old dependency-free workish implem of the parser , - concurrency: on the jvm, it is brought by the use of scalaz.task as a monad. something like cats.eval don't know the scalaz equivalent could be used instead, to effectively disable concurrency. - io: in a first time, a cache-less coursier.fetch https://github.com/alexarchambault/coursier/blob/14f297b4f7ad8cf83abfe030825cd5b51bee64e3/core/shared/src/main/scala/coursier/fetch.scala l9 could be implemented, so that only network stuff would have to be handled. with all these points worked around, a workish scala-native-based command-line tool should be able to run resolutions.
