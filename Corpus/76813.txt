 URL : "https://github.com/ChrisRackauckas/LabelledArrays.jl/issues/2" TITLE : make lmarray labels fast BODY : i was hoping julia base.@pure function symbol_to_index names::sarray, s::symbol findfirst t ->s==t,names end or julia base.@pure function symbol_to_index names, s::symbol i = 0 for n in names i += 1 n == s && return i end return error label not valid end would make julia @inline function base.getindex a::lmarray{s,t,n,l}, s::symbol where {l,n,t,s<:tuple} a.values symbol_to_index a.names, s end the symbol_to_index call be essentially free after the first time it compiles and basically makes a map between symbols and indices, but that doesn't seem to be the case. do i need to val{s} ? that would be fine, especially after https://github.com/julialang/julia/issues/1974 . @mbauman @timholy can i call on your expertise for some advice here on pure functions?
