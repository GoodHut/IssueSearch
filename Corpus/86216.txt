 URL : "https://github.com/dotansimha/angularjs-dropdown-multiselect/issues/313" TITLE : hardcoded open close tags BODY : you're using hardcoded {{ and }} tags. i am and i'm sure many others are using custom angular open/close tags so it won't interfere with my templating engine. i have edited the .js to use my custom tags but it might be nice to have this in a variable somewhere.
