 URL : "https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-content-server/issues/5057" TITLE : send sms ui changes BODY : 1 i noticed that in release, we are not displaying the app store buttons under the sms field or legal text. this is important because it actually indirectly explains to users what they will be sending themselves. this observation was made during ut on the android page of the moz.org site. we had included buttons in the feature doc mocups. 2 the legal text also seems like the same font size as our main call to action. this doesn't seem right. ideally, we can make the font small enough so it is only on 3 lines rather than 4. i wouldn't be surprise if in french or german the text looks even longer, reaching 5 lines. if we don't want to go smaller on legal, then we should make the cta more obvious. 3 also, we also have the why is this required? and maybe later on top of each other. can we put them side by side like in the mockups from feature doc? https://docs.google.com/document/d/133_cu0tlwqziw-ihmh1s-u_80i12mxzcvhqeufhwbpg/edit
