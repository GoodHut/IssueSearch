 URL : "https://github.com/Yakindu/statecharts/issues/1472" TITLE : hook into build project BODY : _if_ this is possible at all, it would be a nice feature for c/c++ statecharts to hook into eclipse / cdts build project . at the time being, in the worst case, one needs to generate the statechart s , the test s , and then build the project. it's only a few clicks but it actually adds up. it would be so much nicer if sct would just listen to build project , execute all sgens and then let eclipse compile the c-code.
