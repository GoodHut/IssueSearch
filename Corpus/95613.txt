 URL : "https://github.com/ForNeVeR/conan-vs-extension/issues/3" TITLE : dependency installation ui BODY : there is a dependency installation menu command, but it should have ui: - select options --build missing , select architecture etc. - show install output - detect installation status i suggest to add a tool window to choose options and install the dependencies. obviously, the process should be asynchronous.
