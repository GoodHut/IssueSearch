 URL : "https://github.com/linkedpipes/etl/issues/501" TITLE : no components found BODY : on a fresh install lp-etl finds no components. is the location of components determined by the executor.osgi.lib.directory or executor.osgi.working.directory configuration properties? they seem to be correctly pointed to the directories in etl/deploy . or is it the storage.jars.directory property? should it point to etl/deploy/jars or etl/deploy/jars/core ? tested using the develop version 654d3d6e04dcba5c86afae69e5d42842c02729c9.
