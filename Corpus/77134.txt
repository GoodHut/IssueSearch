 URL : "https://github.com/tmcw/dx-spec/issues/6" TITLE : modules & categorization BODY : jsdoc has its own idea of modules http://usejsdoc.org/tags-module.html , which i've discussed before https://github.com/documentationjs/documentation/issues/803 issuecomment-330340611 - essentially jsdoc modules are not commonjs or es6 modules. i'm unconvinced that jsdoc modules are a good thing. there are 2 concepts in javascript: actual modules, like things you install with npm and include with require or import membership of one object versus another. foo.bar.baz. jsdoc modules are neither of those things, and i can't find any way in which they're actually helpful to the end user: 99% of the cases where documentation.js users want modules to work, what they're really talking about is membership. i should, though, try to figure out whether: - if you are, for instance, running documentation over a lerna or otherwise new-wave modular https://macwright.org/2016/07/08/lerna-npm-organizations-new-wave-modularity.html project, should we make it possible to document multiple _real modules_ at the same time? - am i missing some value of the jsdoc module concept? is it useful or sensical in some way that i just don't understand yet?
