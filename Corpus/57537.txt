 URL : "https://github.com/JohnAlbin/chroma/issues/53" TITLE : question about license BODY : sorry to bother you with this, but after a lenghty online research i still can't work out how chroma's license affects the general license of a modular sass project and the final stylesheets it produces ... and i'm about to release the project soon on github! i've created a project-documentation theme using sass and various third party modules, including your normalize.scss library, typey-chroma-kss fork: https://github.com/johnalbin/normalize-scss/tree/master/fork-versions/typey-chroma-kss all the sass modules i'm using are mit licensed, except for chroma which is gplv2. i'm having some trouble figuring out how the gplv2 lib affects the license of the project: 1. does my sass project need to be released under gplv2? or can each module retain its license and i can declare my code in the project as mit? 2. does chroma's gplv2 license affect the final css stylesheet? ie: is the compiled css to be considered a derivative of chroma? i'm ok with keeping the sass project under gplv2, but i'd rather have the final css which i'll be using/distributing separately, as a standalone file without the sass files under mit license â€” if possible. thanks a lot for your precious time and help, tristano
