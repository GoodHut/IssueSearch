 URL : "https://github.com/opencaching/gpx-extension/issues/6" TITLE : choosing the namespace BODY : in the current draft, the value for our opencaching extension namespace is https://github.com/opencaching/gpx-extension/tree/stable-v1 . however, i'm thinking that perhaps https://github.com/opencaching/gpx-extension-v1/ would be even better. side effects: if we ever planned to release a new major version 2.x.x , we would be forced to create a new repository instead of creating a new stable-v2 branch . but will we ever? hopefully not. if we include the major version in the name of the repository itself, then we won't need to include it in the branch name. we will be able to stick with the standard git master branch.
