 URL : "https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/issues/2419" TITLE : android 7+ support? BODY : i'm sorry if i missed this information somewhere but are there any plans to support android 7+ in some way? i know xposed isn't on android 7+ but isn't there a way to still provide support? i currently run lineageos 14.1 on my moto x pure clark and i find the privacy guard isn't as great as xprivacy. i can't run some apps without giving them full access to files or my phone sensors even when they don't need that sort of blanket permission to run. i used to run xprivacy but that was before i needed the newer android os to run stuff and stay more secure with updates.
