 URL : "https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap/issues/2910" TITLE : tooltip anchoring issue BODY : the tooltip seems to be anchoring from top left corner instead of the tail of the tooltip. this causes an issue when the tooltip content changes from a very short text to a very large text. the size of the tooltip gets changed but the positioning of it stays the same. is there anyway to fix this issue?
