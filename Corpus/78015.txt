 URL : "https://github.com/rstudio/flexdashboard/issues/149" TITLE : pandoc 2.x compatability BODY : pandoc 2.x seems to break flexdashboard's layout engine. orientation: rows does not take effect and column/row headers appear to not be parsed correctly. dropping back to pandoc 1.19 fixes this problem. running the github version of rmarkdown required for pandoc 2.x has no effect on this issue.
