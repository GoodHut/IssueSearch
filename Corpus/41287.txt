 URL : "https://github.com/keeper013/CrossCutterN/issues/3" TITLE : .net standard weaving BODY : hello, we are interested in this project and we need to use it in a .net standard project... we ported sampleadvice and advice to the new csproj structure and netstandard1.4 and sampletarget to .netcoreapp1.1. when i try to weave the assembly, the weaving finishes correctly. but a mscorlib gets added to the final assembly. we are looking closely at this project, but we will need some features that postsharp has like msbuild task and some optimizations. for example crosscuttern generates a try/catch even when the aspect does not define an action with the exception. we cloud even try to contribute to the project if it fits our needs.
