BODY : hello! i started making some changes to code that i would like to apply as a patch. to do so, i'm using composer to pull down the plugin rather than using the wordpress repo. it would be really helpful to have the tags released to wp also tagged in github. if i want to pull version 0.71.1 from github, i have to use master and watch for another update when i'm updating plugins. if it's not too much trouble for your workflow, could you add those tags to github as well? thanks!
