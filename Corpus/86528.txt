 URL : "https://github.com/erickok/transdroid-search/issues/65" TITLE : https certificate expired BODY : for example going to transdroid.org > menu > setup guides goes to this url: https://www.transdroid.org/download/ the https certificate expired 10 september 2017. browsers reports the site as insecure because of this. you should renew it or temporarily use just http, or if you can't afford to renew just use http. i don't see a critical reason to use https on those sites. the apks, linked to from that page, are on github which is of course secure. if you want https i can give you a link to where you can buy a certificate for 3 years for just 7 usd a year. transdroid is awesome and i've donated, i think various times. regards, olejonbj
