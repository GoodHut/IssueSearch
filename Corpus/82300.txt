 URL : "https://github.com/JohnSundell/ShellOut/issues/9" TITLE : add sample xcode project? BODY : running bash pod try https://github.com/johnsundell/shellout should clone the repo and open a sample project, but produces this error: > unable to find any project in the source files of the pod this is because it can't find a sample project https://github.com/cocoapods/cocoapods-try/blob/2c0840a6ba64056931622abc1d11479ffcc4a31b/lib/pod/command/try.rb l158-l159 . it would be nice to create a simple command line project which just includes shellout and some examples, and/or maybe a playground file.
