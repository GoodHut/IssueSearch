 URL : "https://github.com/astrocatalogs/supernovae/issues/117" TITLE : jla data needs updating BODY : as noticed by chi-hung, the data that appears in the jla dataset on the osc is mostly the original published values, but this data was later revised when the jla was released, as described here http://supernovae.in2p3.fr/sdss_snls_jla/readme.html . this affects snls lcs and some sdss lcs. to fix the issue, the original data will need to be jettisoned in favor of the recalibrated data.
