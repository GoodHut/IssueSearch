 URL : "https://github.com/mattgodbolt/compiler-explorer/issues/608" TITLE : support c, not just c++ BODY : currently, specifying a c standard flag like -std=c11 doesnâ€™t work on either gcc or clang. c++ and c are different languages. c++ is mostly a superset, but there are features c supports and there are edge cases where they both accept some code but behave differently. it would be nice to be able to use c code in compiler explorer even in these circumstances.
