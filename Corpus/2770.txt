 URL : "https://github.com/shayc/cboard/issues/41" TITLE : drag and drop BODY : hi @shayc! cboard looks like a really cool project. while i was playing around with it i figured that it would be great to have the option to reorder the symbols in the output component after they were already selected using drag and drop. is anyone working on such feature?
