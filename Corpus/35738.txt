 URL : "https://github.com/ChemistryPittsburgh/ecms/issues/95" TITLE : extra lines on pages BODY : for some reason when they remove content blocks on the products page, there is an extra line hanging out for example composite panels http://ecms.chemistry.digital:8080/product/composite-panels/. i looked in the cms and it looks like there is no option to remove the third content block like there is for content block 2. maybe that’s causing the issue? looks like it’s fine for the other pages - just some of the products like metal roofing, ornamental & composite panels. ! screen shot 2017-01-03 at 4 18 37 pm https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16961015/21623338/e21d56fc-d1cf-11e6-8c6b-585a657ced14.png
