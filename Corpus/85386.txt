 URL : "https://github.com/powroupi/blender_mmd_tools/issues/69" TITLE : exporting uneditable pmxs BODY : another situation where mmd_tools is exporting a mmd readable model but not a pmxe readable model corrupted header? i don't know. using pmxe from https://eoscustom3d.deviantart.com/art/english-pmx-editor-v1-1-542100208 . bad .blend + .pmx are at http://www.mediafire.com/file/v31u19hsg3hexcv/badexports.zip . apologies for the size of the file. as to how i've created such a mess of a file: i have curve objects that i fit to my current version of a model. when i decide that some part isn't good enough, i import my current model, often just for placement and visualization, and adjust the curve, then create a mesh object from it. in these case, i don't need the entire model, my goal is really just to get a copy of my adjusted mesh out of blender, which i can integrate into my model relatively worry free in pmxe. in the files provided, there are a few adjusted materials off to the side of the main model; those are all i care about getting out of blender. after a bit of work, these files can accumulate several different mmd models; well, copies of the same model, really. i'm sure that my style isn't the best for doing this, and any recommendations for ways i should be doing things differently are welcome. for example, is there some good, simple way to remove a mmd model from a scene? deleting it from the outliner leaves a lot of debris. eventually i managed to get my meshes exported from this file, but i'm not sure exactly how : however, i also think that mmd_tools probably shouldn't be exporting uneditable .pmx files.
