 URL : "https://github.com/lefthandedgoat/canopy/issues/346" TITLE : text search whitespace BODY : trying to click a button can lead to somewhat unpredictable behavior; example 1: html <a> click here to proceed </a> example 2 html <a>click here to proceed</a> f click text click here to proceed the above f will error out for example 1, but work fine for example 2; i assume because of the whitespace around the text within the anchor tag.
