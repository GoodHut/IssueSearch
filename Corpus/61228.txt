 URL : "https://github.com/MrSwitch/hello.js/issues/503" TITLE : allow for custom fields BODY : case:: for my application i use hello to enable authentication via social media platforms. however for maintenance reasons i use only 1 registered app at in this case google. since the return uri cannot be dynamic i need to reroute on my server, good and all, however, it is not possible to add custom fields to the return uri to my understanding , right now i piggybacked it on the state setting fairly certain this is an internally user setting not really meant for this use . so my request is to either update the documentation for hello.init to mention that state can bu used to pass parameters or create a state that allows for custom fields.
