 URL : "https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/yauzl/issues/60" TITLE : more files than entrycount BODY : my apologies if this is addressed elsewhere. i couldn't find it in the readme or issues. i have a zip file with ~70k files, but the file catalog says it has only 14,202. on my mac: unzip -zh file.zip yields zip file size: 139476498 bytes, number of entries: 14202 unzip -l file.zip yields 557051138 ... 79738 files i'm not sure where the discrepancy comes from, but if i unzip the file using unzip on the command line, or double click it in finder, all ~70k files unzip. using yauzl, it only unzips the first 14202 files and then ends/closes. i tried with my own implementation and also using examples/unzip.js in the repo. is there some way to configure yauzl to unzip all the files in the zip, regardless of the reported number of entries?
