 URL : "https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightGallery/issues/536" TITLE : captions not showing up BODY : i swear i used to have captions working, but i no longer see them and can't figure out how to make them work again. i changed some seemingly unrelated things to get lightgallery to refresh when i changed my isotope filter on what images were visible, but i guess i messed something up somewhere. this are my lightgallery options: $lg.lightgallery { //activate lightgallery //lightgallery settings pager: false, speed: 325, //css animation speed in ms preload: 2, subhtmlselectorrelative: true, //activate captions fullscreen: true, //activate fullscreen plugin autoplay: false, //dont automatically start autoplaying progressbar: true, //disable autoplay progress bar pause: 6500, //time between slide changes in ms selector: '.current' //selector class } ; and i call that on doc ready. here's my markup: <a href= images/2016-the_addams_family_2.jpg data-sub-html= .caption ><img data-src= images/2016-the_addams_family_2.jpg class= griditem assistantlightingdesigner electrician current onload= layoutisotope ><div class= caption ><h4><em>the addams family</em></h4><p> so give us shadows and give us gloom </p></div></a> all of my images are laid out in an isotope grid with a few filters. all of that works fine, the lightgallery opens, the filters work, the gallery refreshes to deal with the changes, everything is fine, but i don't have an captions. i don't think i changed anything that should have an affect on them, but i can't for the life of me figure out what's up. attached are are my source files. i use requirejs, isotope, and some other things running on a lamp server. if anyone has any idea what i'm doing wrong, or what's going on it would be very appreciated! -tcj 2016 - tcj.design.zip https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightgallery/files/706967/2016.-.tcj.design.zip
