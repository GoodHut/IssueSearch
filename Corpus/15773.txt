 URL : "https://github.com/locationtech-labs/geopyspark/issues/266" TITLE : fix pyramid class BODY : as of right now, the pyramid class needs a bit of work before we merge the milstone/mvp branch into master . the two main issues are: certain methods don't work and no documentation. in regards to the former, an example can be seen in the to_png_pyramid method here https://github.com/locationtech-labs/geopyspark/blob/milestone/mvp/geopyspark/geotrellis/rdd.py l1129 . self.levels is a dict where the key is the zoom_level and the value is the respective tiledrasterrdd . however, looking at the constructor https://github.com/locationtech-labs/geopyspark/blob/milestone/mvp/geopyspark/geotrellis/render.py l41 for pngrdd , we can see that pyramid is expected to be a list. thus, an error will arise when the user executes to_png_pyramid . as of the latter, once the issues with the functionality of the class have been resolved, docstrings and a more formal write up on this class will fix the issue.
