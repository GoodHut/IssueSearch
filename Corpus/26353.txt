 URL : "https://github.com/amazeeio/lagoon/issues/153" TITLE : api: update objects BODY : we can create and delete objects from the api, now we would also like to update them : i'm envisioning a system where you just pass in a patch object with the values you want updated, see https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/designing-graphql-mutations-e09de826ed97 example: graphql updateproject input: {name: dockerhub2slack , patch: {git_url: git@github.com:amazeeio/dockerhub2slack.git , branches: master|develop }} { git_url } this would at the same time update the fields git_url and branches while not touching the others at all. additionally we have some fields with default values, we need a way to tell the api that we want to reset fields to their default, not sure what to use here, maybe just null on the field? seeking help here : @ryyppy
