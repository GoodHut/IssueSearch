BODY : // : please provide us your logs/configuration folder if you are reporting a crash. // : compress the whole %appdata%\soundswitch directory and upload it. audioendpointlibrary.zip https://github.com/belphemur/soundswitch/files/1281015/audioendpointlibrary.zip sorry i have no clue whee the logs hide. i looked in event logs to no avail. my problem is soundswitch is running but it is not in the taskbar. if i go to task manager it is there but not on taskbar. when it launches i get the message, impossible to register hotkey:alt + control + f11:true if i hit alt, ctrl, f11 nothing happens. this issue did not start until i upgraded to a i7 and had to re register windows 10 pro x 64. i did a uninstall, reboot and reinstalled with same results. any ideas?
