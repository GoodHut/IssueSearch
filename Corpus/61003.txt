 URL : "https://github.com/maxking/docker-mailman/issues/7" TITLE : add support for postfix BODY : right now the only supported mta is exim4. this is because of the way different mta are made aware about the addresses of the existing lists on the server. to use postfix, mailman needs access to postmap command, which is supposed to be on the host and not accessible from within the container. a possible workaround for this could be to install postfix inside of the container too and then make it generate transport maps for the postfix installation outside the container. exim4 works differently. it can be configured to check for the lists by creating simple files/folders at a predefined location with the names of the lists. mailman already does thist at var_dir/lists which is what we use here.
