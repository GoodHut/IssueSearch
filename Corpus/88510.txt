 URL : "https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets/issues/596" TITLE : nodejs: 'listening' event BODY : what platform/language are you using? node.js what version of uws are you using? release v0.14.5 how does the issue reproduce? all the time can you show me some short code that triggers your issue or any other important information? expected behavior: javascript // server.js const websocketserver = require 'uws' .server const wss = new websocketserver { port: 8080 } wss.on 'listening', => console.log 'the server has been bound!' after run we have the expected output: shell $ node server.js the server has been bound! what i think a wrong behavior: javascript // server.js const http = require 'http' const websocketserver = require 'uws' .server const server = http.createserver const wss = new websocketserver { server } wss.on 'listening', => console.log 'the server has been bound!' server.listen 8080, => { console.log 'listening on %d', server.address .port } after run we have: shell $ node server.js listening on 8080 but expect: shell $ node server.js the server has been bound! listening on 8080
