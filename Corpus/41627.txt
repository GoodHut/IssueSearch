 URL : "https://github.com/PsychoinformaticsLab/neuroscout-cli/issues/16" TITLE : add ability to log in BODY : low priority, since all we're doing is pulling publicly available stuff from server. but in the future we may want to allow users configure their username and password to be able to push results or other info. similarly to git. this requires obtaining a jwt token from /auth storing it, and checking for expiration jwts have data in them, such as their expiration date . requests that require authorization embed the jwt in the header see main repo .
