 URL : "https://github.com/google/ci_edit/issues/114" TITLE : color code uppercase words BODY : seems like a good feature, both for coding and note taking., since i use caps for some headers and terms. maybe a nice blue? although i think i said before, but this could make the message line at the bottom of the screen save changes? yes, no, or cancel : less noticeable when it appears. i don't think we've used green, brown, magenta, or yellow yet, so maybe one of these basic colors? we could also play around with maybe the background rather than the foreground color, though i don't think that would be very aesthetically pleasing. maybe we could have a highlighting feature though or custom text colors that allow for overriding these defaults.
