_originally opened as https://github.csiro.au/ts-filesystems/cogent/issues/101_ ---- i run validate.sh with the flag -ac . it failed for all the 89 small examples.
error messages look like this. pass_yet-another-take-put.cdsl2: ./validate.sh: line 513: inputc: command not found
cdsl2: no cdsl file specified run cdsl2 -h' for help ./validate.sh: line 157: isabelle: command not found fail i got this kind of error messages 89 times. they say no cdsl file specified .
but i think users of validate.sh should not have to specify which cdsl2 file to be checked,
since validate.sh is meant to validate the cogen framework against all of these 89 small examples. i am not good at shell-script.
any idea?
