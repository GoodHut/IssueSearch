 URL : "https://github.com/cos-labs/share-analytics/issues/132" TITLE : code review use of routes BODY : the app currently is empty on root index and needs a /dashboard/institution to run properly. i may not be remembering the previous conversions on this decision but if it is possible to place it at the root level by removing /dashboard it may be better. https://github.com/cos-labs/share-analytics/blob/master/app/router.js l10 also is the /info route being used? the about information for institution is a widget in its own dashboard and its template is empty. https://github.com/cos-labs/share-analytics/blob/develop/app/router.js l13
