 URL : "https://github.com/pipelinedb/pipelinedb/issues/1807" TITLE : don't support lag function BODY : when i want to use the lag function, server will close the connection. stats_pipeline= create continuous view live.test as stats_pipeline- select user_id, lag log_content->>'id',1 over order by user_id, _id as last_id from streams.report_client stats_pipeline- where log_content->>'id'='cn.colorv.ui.activity.live.liveactivity'; server closed the connection unexpectedly this probably means the server terminated abnormally before or while processing the request. the connection to the server was lost. attempting reset: succeeded. if i remove the lag function, every thing goes well stats_pipeline= create continuous view live.test as stats_pipeline- select user_id, count 1 from streams.report_client stats_pipeline- where log_content->>'id'='cn.colorv.ui.activity.live.liveactivity' stats_pipeline- group by user_id; create continuous view is this a bug or not?
