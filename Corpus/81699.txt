 URL : "https://github.com/vonnagy/service-container/issues/8" TITLE : 404 error on health check BODY : hi, i have a problem with my class path and vonnagy.service-container. i start a service from init.d where i have class path hard-coded like this : java_cp= $lib_dir/com.mf.mfeed-reporting-service-container-1.0.0.jar:$lib_dir/com.github.vonnagy.service-container_2.11-2.0.6.jar:$lib_dir when the service starts i execute curl http://localhost:port/health and everything works as expected. when i try to pass the class path as java_cp= ${java_cp}:${appdir}/lib/ cp_sep=':' the service starts and executes with no problem but when i try the curl command it fails with: { code :404, message : the requested resource could not be found but may be available again in the future. , details : \ the requested resource could not be found\ } could be a problem in the order in witch the libraries are loaded because this is the only thing that differ from those class paths ? thanks for your help, mihaesu bogdan
