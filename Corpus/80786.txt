 URL : "https://github.com/TerribleDev/gulp-nuget-restore/issues/6" TITLE : update version of nuget? BODY : the current version of nuget used in the gulp-nuget-restore plugin is 3.4.4 which does not detect vs2017 msbuild tools. could a new version be released with nuget 4.1.0 inside? it detects vs2017 and i tried dropping this version of nuget.exe into the plugin folder and it seems to work without any further changes.
