 URL : "https://github.com/jakob101/RelativePathRefactor/issues/2" TITLE : some paths skipped BODY : _some_ import statements are incorrectly skipped when fixing relative paths. example 1: before back two directories : javascript import { connect } from 'react-redux'; import { membera } from '../../shared/app/someutil'; import { memberb, memberc } from '../../shared/account/someworkflow'; import { memberd } from '../../shared/app/anotherworkflow'; example 1: after back three directories : javascript import { connect } from 'react-redux'; import { membera } from ../../../shared/app/localeutil ; // updated import { memberb, memberc } from '../../shared/account/someworkflow'; // skipped import { memberd } from '../../shared/app/anotherworkflow'; // skipped example 2: before back two directories : javascript import { link } from 'react-router'; import { membera, memberb } from '../../shared/util/images'; import image from '../../shared/component/image'; import as classnames from 'classnames'; example 2: after back three directories : javascript import { link } from 'react-router'; import { membera, memberb } from '../../shared/util/images'; // skipped import image from ../../../shared/component/image ; // updated import as classnames from 'classnames'; this problem occurs throughout several of my project's files. it seems to occur for both single member and multiple member imports. interestingly it seems to struggle with imports with multiple members within a single line, but succeeds if they're split e.g. javascript import { membera, memberb } from '../../shared/util/images'; // skipped import { memberc, memberd, membere, } from '../../../shared/account/someutil'; // updated
