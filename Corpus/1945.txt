 URL : "https://github.com/BOINC/boinc/issues/2054" TITLE : move 2 prefs BODY : the ok to send email and ok to show hosts prefs are currently part of project prefs. i think they belong in community prefs instead. that's where other communication and privacy prefs are. except for these 2 items, project prefs involve computing: which apps to run, resource share, etc. in fact it would be clearer to call them project computing prefs.
