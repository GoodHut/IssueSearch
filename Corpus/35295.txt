 URL : "https://github.com/workco/marvin/issues/41" TITLE : doc: no build script BODY : documentation out-of-date? https://github.com/workco/marvin build-client-production says npm run build but there is no build script. in general i don't understand the x:build scripts. from the name i would expect them to generate files in the build folder and then return. instead they do some work and then seem to hang. somewhere in there it says webpack is watching the files... as if it is going to sit around and watch for changes and not return - maybe that's what it's doing. v0.2.0 on windows 7 i added set before the node_env= parts of the various x:build scripts because without it windows told me there was no such command as node_env.
