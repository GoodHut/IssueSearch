 URL : "https://github.com/gallantlab/pycortex/issues/175" TITLE : manuscript quality figure BODY : i think that it would be beneficial to have a script that generates some standard set of maps for publication quality figures. e.g. like quickflat but adding medial and lateral inflated views. i'm not aware of this functionality but perhaps it exists? i know members of the gallant lab have previously published papers using pycortex. what method did you find generated the highest quality images? i am currently blowing the brains up as much as i can on a retina display and screenshotting the brain, but i doubt this is a great method.
