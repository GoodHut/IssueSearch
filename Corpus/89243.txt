 URL : "https://github.com/HALRobotics/Beta/issues/2" TITLE : priority loader exception BODY : occasionally, when loading grasshopper no login screen will be shown and instead a priority loader error popup will appear with the message asynchelpers.runtask... threw an exception. the error message indicates an aggregate exception but the nested elements are inaccessible. this seems to be something to do with the licensing system but due to the sporadic nature of the bug i'm struggling to pinpoint the cause. temporary solution: _1. close all instances of rhino 2. open the directory %localappdata%\hal in a file explorer 3. delete all .lic files 4. restart rhino and grasshopper and reenter your credentials_ this is still an issue with the below builds: installation configuration: hal.abb.1.0.17257.2-beta hal.kuka.1.0.17256.2-beta hal.mcneel.v5.1.0.17260.3-beta licenses: hal.core - 09/17/2017 22:54:22
