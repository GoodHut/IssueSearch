 URL : "https://github.com/KelleyWhite/Colmar_Project/issues/4" TITLE : start learning section BODY : the picture and the description should be together, you have them separated, also you have them in different locations and not stack in two rows of threes. a margin-top 0px; will solve this one problem but you still need to adjust the divs so they are all the same size. ! col4 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5844161/26711042/9bccb8c4-4712-11e7-9841-81a9f79f3ed6.png now if they were stacked up on top of each other it may have been because you were on a smaller screen size but the spacing is still there and the bottom 3 divs are different sizes. ! col5 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5844161/26711091/fbef9370-4712-11e7-9975-30739de541cb.png this issue maybe caused by your min-height set in your media query.
