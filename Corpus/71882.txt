 URL : "https://github.com/libretro/parallel-n64/issues/457" TITLE : analog stick sensitivity BODY : i'm using a n64 controller through the mayflash usb adapter. the gamepad configuration is functional however the stick is problematic, pushing it all the way in any direction only registers as barely pushed . i tried lowering the dead zone down to 0.010 but it didn't make a difference. from what i understand what i need to do is raising the peak but i can't find a way to do that. did i miss or something or are we lacking a configuration property? thank you.
