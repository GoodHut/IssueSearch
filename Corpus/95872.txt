 URL : "https://github.com/lhorie/mithril.js/issues/1750" TITLE : document versioning policy BODY : since mithril doesn't follow semver, but uses a similar numbering scheme post a 1.0.0 release, it would be appropriate to state what the versioning policy is somewhere. as mentioned elsewhere, semver has specific rationale and deviating from that in undocumented ways mainly causes grief. intentionally or unintentionally the previous release seems to actually have been compatible from what i can tell at a glance.
