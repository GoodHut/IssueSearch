 URL : "https://github.com/docker-library/haproxy/issues/47" TITLE : env-file items not working BODY : i've tried to create a docker instance and running with an --env-file to build the config for other users to easily adapt items such as; - ssl cert - ssl key - listen port frontend - connection timeouts it seems a lot of the values don't get passed in, especially numbers. setting the values to static values in the .cfg file gets me past the error, however there is still an issue with the ssl keys/certs. i add my .crt and .pem to /usr/local/etc/haproxy and set the following to the frontend bind: bind 0.0.0.0:443 name frontend_app ssl crt /usr/local/etc/haproxy/ ${cert} ca-file /usr/local/etc/haproxy/ ${certpem} however it doesn't produce any useful errors, is this the correct method for ssl certs and keys, and will the environment variables work? my envrionment file is runtime.env and contains: cert=test.cer certkey=test.pem the files are copied during the docker build and present in the filesystem. docker version: 17.09-ce-mac35 channel: stable haproxy version: 1.7.9 based on alpine/image here.
