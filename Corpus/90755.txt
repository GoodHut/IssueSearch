 URL : "https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/issues/2133" TITLE : static content not copied BODY : hi everyone, i've tried nearly everything to make pelican copy my static content. to out-rule the obvious things: path is set to 'content' static_path contains all the directories needed the file is even referenced in a page with the {attach}-syntax which then produces the unable to find 'blabla-file.jpg', skipping url replacement. the auto-generated fab/make is used themes have varied the only used plugin is page-hierarchy whatever setting i tried, i never was able to copy static content into the output/static or whatever folder. never. so either there is a bug somewhere or i am really missing a point. do you have any idea? or could you may tell me a very simple example that has to work? i did not really find any example attaching static content other then i did yes, i looked through a couple of samples . pelican 3.7.1 python 2.7 using conda-env on ubuntu
