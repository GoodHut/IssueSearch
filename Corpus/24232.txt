 URL : "https://github.com/SAP/openui5/issues/1300" TITLE : show text in input BODY : hi all i have a input box, that makes a suggestion to the user, as soon as user type something inside. ! 09-01-_2017_10-23-57 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/701611/21763574/d206b982-d65e-11e6-8584-d03a6e42b42e.png it works as expected. in addition, i want that the text kalkulationswerk appears inside the input box but not a part of input value. the input value should be only 3840. is there anyway to do that? thanks
