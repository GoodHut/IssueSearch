 URL : "https://github.com/Morikko/sync-tab-groups/issues/25" TITLE : add open in new window BODY : maybe this is contrary to your goals, but i'd love the ability to open the group in a new window without closing the current group. i have multiple workflows that i like to jump between quickly, would be better if i could just use this as a bookmark for all of them.
