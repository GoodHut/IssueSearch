 URL : "https://github.com/500tech/angular-tree-component/issues/427" TITLE : feature checkbox support BODY : motivation as mentioned in the what's next https://github.com/500tech/angular-tree-component whats-next section of the readme, checkbox support would be a beneficial feature for many use cases. i have a couple questions that i'd like to ask publicly to see what the future of this feature will be, as i am sure other plugin users are wondering the same. what is in scope vs. out of scope? - checkbox tied to selection - checking/unchecking of individual nodes, and all nodes through treemodel or treenode api - support for inserting one's own checkbox. say, angular material's checkbox https://material.angular.io/components/checkbox/overview any idea of when implementation for this might start? ------ thank you to all the maintainers for such a mature plugin given how new angular is as a framework!
