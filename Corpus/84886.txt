 URL : "https://github.com/Thutmose/Thut/issues/76" TITLE : doors not opening/closing BODY : when i first used thus's elevator this worked very nicely pre-1.10.2, can't remember what version . now in 1.10.2 the feature does not appear to work, or am i missing something. the rest of the mod seems to work fine. perhaps a feature to hide floors that are not used would be nice. a very clever mod!
