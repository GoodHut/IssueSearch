 URL : "https://github.com/Kamalisk/arkhamdb/issues/117" TITLE : handling of player groups BODY : hi, it would be cool if the system could handle campaigns with team of players. so me and my two friends could add our decks to one campaign , and browse each other decks directly from there. even better if we could see all characters decklists in the same view. perhaps a small message log, etc. if this is already supported, please forgive me. you are more than welcome to explain how to do this then. :-
