 URL : "https://github.com/ChoralCloud/ChoralWeb/issues/71" TITLE : clean up choral list page BODY : i think we could make this page nicer. instead of being a table, we could maybe use cards with buttons on them the same buttons as we currently have on the table entries . also i don't think we should show the function on the table rows or cards if we do that , we won't ever have enough space to show the whole thing, so we should probably just remove it, and instead add a button to view/edit the function where something like a modal would pop up, or just another page for now.
