 URL : "https://github.com/calzoneman/sync/issues/645" TITLE : execemotes is inefficient BODY : execemotes might be more efficient if a single regex was used instead of testing every single emote's regex on a message, especially if a room's emote list grows into the high hundreds. probably the only issue i can see is enforcing a specific delimiter to find emotes maybe one that the room's admins can define? average execution times using console.time and console.timeend within execemotes 21 messages, 666 emotes : rewritten execemotes with single regex|old execemotes :--------:|:-------: 0.0457ms|0.6907ms huge relative difference, but still less than 1ms. nonetheless, efficiency is pretty nice :feelsgood: people with really slow computers might benefit too but i'm not sure on that
