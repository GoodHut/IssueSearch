 URL : "https://github.com/onelogin/wordpress-saml/issues/34" TITLE : add more php constants BODY : hey folks, thanks so much for creating this plugin. i'm currently using it for a client project at the moment and i was wondering if you'd be open to me adding a pull request that add some optional php constants for the following settings: - idp entity id - single sign on service url - single log out service url - x.509 certificate if those constants are defined then those settings would be automatically added and i'd also change those fields to read only and have a message saying that those constants have been defined. this would enable developers to keep those constants in version control and not have to set them up manually across multiple environments. let me know what you think of the idea. thanks!
