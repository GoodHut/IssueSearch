 URL : "https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/192" TITLE : build client-only bundle BODY : not sure if this is supported. i'd like to use nuxt to replace a somewhat complicated vue/webpack setup to generate javascript assets for a phoenix app. as such, i don't want ssr at all. i just want the nice convention over configuration. is there any way to do this currently? static generation isn't quite what i want, because my app is still dynamic. i just don't want to use nuxt as my server. thanks.
