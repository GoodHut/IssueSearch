 URL : "https://github.com/mwrlabs/needle/issues/166" TITLE : needleagent debug log BODY : issue needleagent does not seem to provide any detailed debug log without using xcode expected behaviour it would be great if needleagent could have an option to produce some sort of debug log when requested e.g. another toggle on the agent screen . actual behaviour unless i am mistaken, you have to use xcode to debug needleagent and discover why it is not responding. device ios version ipad 9.2.1
