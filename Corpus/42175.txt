 URL : "https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-glsl/issues/51" TITLE : allow glsl for vulkan BODY : it would be great to have a way to invoke glslangvalidator such that it can parse vulkan specific glsl ie. compile to spir-v using the -v option . currently, lines such as layout push_constant uniform get flagged as an error, with the error message being 'push_constant' : only allowed when using glsl for vulkan. cheers.
