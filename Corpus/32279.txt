 URL : "https://github.com/mstratman/cocoadialog/issues/93" TITLE : update app identity BODY : the name of the app has had various cases through out the years. considering most cli tools are all lowercase, i think it makes sense to just standardize on lowercasing everything to cocoadialog . also, the icon is quite outdated to say the least. i've been working on modernizing it so it looks similar to other macos icons and hopefully conveys through color and the titlebar buttons what this app is/does: ! cocoadialog-512 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/351902/25292785/4fa75296-269d-11e7-970b-8d77a167ef09.png
