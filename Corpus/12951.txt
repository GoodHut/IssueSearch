 URL : "https://github.com/infolk11/btw17/issues/20" TITLE : so many branches BODY : from time to time we should merge our different branches. otherwise we will force problems, today i could not compile our code because i had an error in one of our xml files. and i have no idea where this did come from. currently we have development, plotting and graphics for almost the same work to do. this is will end up in chaos, if we do not fix it yet. @anonymonline @steve-f333 @anonym0nline
