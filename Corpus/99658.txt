 URL : "https://github.com/coreos/terraform-provider-ct/issues/7" TITLE : naming needs some tweaking BODY : ct refers to the container-linux-config-transpiler - a tool for transpiling from container linux configs to ignition configs. i think it might make more sense to not tie this provider to ct explicitly, but instead just consume the ct library. maybe this would be called terraform-provider-clc instead. there are also a few references in the readme that should be updated to refer to the ingested configuration as container linux configs.
