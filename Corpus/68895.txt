 URL : "https://github.com/jumpnow/buildroot/issues/1" TITLE : slowness and quirkiness BODY : hello, i have build your branch and all seemed fine. i installed the sdcard into my rpi3 and it booted up in a very long time. to me anything more than 10 seconds is too long. i also noticed that the sdcard got weird with some i/o error when doing a shutdown . i can't recall the actual error. i was able the first time to invoke the qt app.
