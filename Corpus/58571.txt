 URL : "https://github.com/Det-Kongelige-Bibliotek/MerMEId/issues/27" TITLE : sorting by work number BODY : sorting by work number only works if it is indeed a pure number. most newer catalogues e.g. mendelssohn are using a letter+number designation. the function used for sorting by work number mermeid/trunk/xqueries/main_loop.xqm should split letters from numbers before adding zeros, i.e. a work number like c 64 should be processed as c000000000000064 instead of 00000000000c 64 . is the predicate in this line needed? > let $num:=$doc//m:workdesc/m:work/m:identifier @label=$collection 1 /string the work number _label_ is not always necessarily the same as the _collection_.
