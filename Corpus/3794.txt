 URL : "https://github.com/OSSHealth/ghdata/issues/22" TITLE : use of django BODY : earlier, derek and i discussed using django vs flask for our web portion, and we had initially decided on flask. however, matt and i discussed today that django may allow for a known organization of what goes where in the code, which may help others to understand our project. this could lead to easier contributions from others if they also understand the django framework. i had installed django for some of the initial work i did on learning to connect to the api, and i found it was quite easy to use. here is a tutorial about making a django app: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/intro/tutorial01/. one thing i did not follow from the tutorial was setting it up to work with a database i imported a separate driver , so if we were to follow the framework we'd probably need to do it that way instead. i am about to head to the lab meeting, but i have a views.py i will also post later to show an example of using django though i admit i didn't organize it correctly to be django-like .
