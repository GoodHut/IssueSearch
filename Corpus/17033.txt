 URL : "https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost-CLI/issues/314" TITLE : mysql setup check BODY : all the other extensions, etc, have setup checks i believe, except mysql ghost doctor needs to output information about whether mysql is available or not. ghost install should abort if mysql is not available and --db=sqlite3 was not passed it should tell the user to either try running with --db=sqlite3 , or to use ghost install local .
