 URL : "https://github.com/iPuTTY/iPuTTY/issues/29" TITLE : putty 0.70 update BODY : putty 0.70 update 반영: security fix: the windows putty binaries should no longer be vulnerable to hijacking by specially named dlls in the same directory, even a name we missed when we thought we'd fixed this in 0.69. see vuln-indirect-dll-hijack-3. windows putty should be able to print again, after our dll hijacking defences broke that functionality. windows putty should be able to accept keyboard input outside the current code page, after our dll hijacking defences broke that too.
