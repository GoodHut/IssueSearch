 URL : "https://github.com/18F/openFEC-web-app/issues/1852" TITLE : committee cycle bug BODY : i believe there are multiple instances of this bug, so if this logic were fixed, i think it will fix a lot of committee broken links. this is related to this issue 1845 this bug seems to happen when election_full=true . if the committee filing does not exist for a given year whether it be because they were terminated or has not filed yet , the url_for function needs to have logic to accommodate for those particular instances. right now, i believe it is just taking the submitted cycle parameter as is with no additional logic? cc @jwchumley @paulclark2 @lindsayyoung @ccostino terminated committee example garn, e. j. jake link: https://beta.fec.gov/data/candidate/s4ut00027/?cycle=1986&election_full=true campaign committees garn campaign committee links for money raised, money spent, reports filed are all broken because it is trying to pull a non-existent cycle 1986 , even though the committee was terminated in 1984. joint fundraising committees garn/cftr reception committee link is broken because it is trying to pull a non-existent cycle 1986 , my assumption is that this committee was also terminated in 1984. not yet filed committee example cochran, thad link: https://beta.fec.gov/data/candidate/s8ms00055/?cycle=2020 campaign committees citizens for cochran link is broken because it is trying to pull 2020 cycle information for the committee, but they have not filed yet for that cycle.
