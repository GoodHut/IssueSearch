 URL : "https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/bitflags/issues/67" TITLE : flags is meaningless BODY : this threw me off when reading the bitflags documentation for the first time. rust bitflags! { flags flags: u32 { / ... / } } i know it is not a keyword because my ide does not highlight it like one. the casing suggests that it is a variable name or module name. nope, it is a nugatory token required by the macro. i think the important relevant thing to communicate to readers is that a type with the given name is being declared by the macro. either of the following would be far more valuable i think. rust bitflags! { type flags: u32 { / ... / } } rust bitflags! { struct flags: u32 { / ... / } }
