 URL : "https://github.com/titusfortner/webdrivers/issues/4" TITLE : dealing with webmock BODY : i'm using webmock in my tests and i can't figure out a good way to deal with it blocking webdrivers ' requests. i've tried not requiring webmock in the gem file, and explicitly requiring it after webdrivers in test_helper.rb and it still blocks the request... do you have a good method for avoiding this problem? where do you normally require 'webdrivers' ? do you use webmock ? is there a command i can call to make it download the drivers immediately so it doesn't get caught after webmock is initialized?
