 URL : "https://github.com/yesodweb/wai/issues/603" TITLE : warp terminates silently BODY : on a system i've observed that a web server application written using warp sometimes terminates with exit code 0 for no reason. after some debugging, i noticed that it ran out of file descriptors. the problem lies here: https://github.com/yesodweb/wai/blob/c6a542cc4bc51106b207432b1ef81e8dd675a323/warp/network/wai/handler/warp/run.hs l224-l253 . with the default configuration, the exception is not logged and the runloop simply terminates. i think we should always log the expection in default configuration if the server terminates.
