BODY : _from @jouni on september 1, 2017 12:24_ the current way for our elements to define the icons is using custom web fonts, so they can be changed easily with css. but it has some drawbacks: - the need to produce custom web fonts when you want to change the icons in your app/theme - the rendering of the icons is subject to the font rendering algorithm of the platform, which makes the icons look suboptimal in some situations like on windows with cleartype i’ve been thinking if we could change the icons to use iron-icon instead, which is the standard way of using icons in polymer apps. so, for vaadin-date-picker for example, we would have something like this: css :host { --toggle-button-icon: vaadin:calendar ; } html <iron-icon class= toggle-button icon= _geticon ></iron-icon> javascript _geticon { return getcomputedstyle this .getpropertyvalue --toggle-button-icon ; } this wouldn’t allow the developer to dynamically change the icon at runtime unless we provide some api for that , but i consider that as an acceptable tradeoff, as it’s not a common use case. thoughts, could this work? _copied from original issue: vaadin/vaadin-themes 47_
