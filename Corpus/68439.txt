 URL : "https://github.com/thomasfl/filewatcher/issues/73" TITLE : ruby api example update BODY : hello, first off i'm a new developer and this is my first time opening an issue on an os project so please be gentle! the ruby api examples show filewatcher.new instead of filewatcher.new: ruby require 'filewatcher' filewatcher.new 'lib/', 'rakefile' .watch do |filename| puts changed {filename} end should be: ruby require 'filewatcher' filewatcher.new 'lib/', 'rakefile' .watch do |filename| puts changed {filename} end ruby as in the gem file the class is defined as filewatcher: ruby class filewatcher attr_accessor :filenames def self.version return '0.5.4' end thanks for this awesome gem!
