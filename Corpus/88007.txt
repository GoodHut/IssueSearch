 URL : "https://github.com/FACN1/week3-javiasy/issues/57" TITLE : misleading function names BODY : imho most of your function names are misleading. for example getcharurls: https://github.com/facn1/week3-javiasy/blob/master/main.js l74 i would expect this to return char urls, but instead it makes a request, etc. this may require some sort of overhaul/mass restructuring, apologies.
