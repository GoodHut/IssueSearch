 URL : "https://github.com/JeffreyBLewis/WebVoteView/issues/245" TITLE : key vote tooltips BODY : instead of the tooltips, add small colored tags one for cq and one for wikipedia . this might not work if you have more than those two sources for key vote designations or if they tend to mostly overlap. could also try getting rid of the star and just shorted the tooltips: “designated by cq” and “designated by wikipedia”
