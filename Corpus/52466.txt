 URL : "https://github.com/redcap-tools/redcap-tools.github.io/issues/24" TITLE : coherent github topics BODY : to any developers of redcap api packages/code including @tjrivera, @aarenson, @nutterb, @sburns, @pbchase, @eugyev, @peterclark, @haozhu233, @james2012, @agapow : github's new topics https://github.com/blog/2309-introducing-topics should help make our libraries more findable. this makes me happy a maintainer of the redcap tools projects page http://redcap-tools.github.io/projects/ , because it should make it easier for someone to find a library/package that best suits their needs and environment. i've recently asked the redcap development committee to agree on a coherent scheme eg , redcap , redcap-api , and redcap-plugin so our repos' tags aren't so scattered. of course these are just suggestions to help identify & distinguish the roles of our packages; i'm not pretending to have authority over anyone. for now, i think you can apply redcap without worrying about conflicting with the upcoming scheme. i'll give the committee a week or two and report the results.
