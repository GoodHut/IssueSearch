 URL : "https://github.com/mmouterde/FlexyTrello/issues/33" TITLE : board switch bug BODY : clicking the trello boards button in top left corner then a different board causes flexy features to disappear. the min, max, and resize flexy buttons that normally appear on cards are gone after the newly selected board loads. if i reload the page using ctrl + r flexy features reappear. my guess is flexy code is not detecting the board switches when using trello's boards button. i'm using chrome version 59.0.3071.104 official build 64-bit .
