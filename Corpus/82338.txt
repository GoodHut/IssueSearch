 URL : "https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/issues/989" TITLE : add static link to cython BODY : hi there, great library! we want to run capstone on aws lambda with cython, but it seems that capstone only produce ccapstone.so file, but we want ccapstone.a file for capstone. unfortunately aws lambda does not support .so , so we have to use ccapstone.a it can gain huge performance improve if we can use ccapstone.a on lambda lambda only allow up to 5 min job can you add this support? thank in advance!
