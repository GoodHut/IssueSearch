 URL : "https://github.com/ATFutures/dodgr/issues/35" TITLE : reinstate test for paths BODY : the final test for lengths of paths between edges and vertices no longer works. the latter should generate paths that have lengths one greater than the former, yet they don't for cases in which vertex paths have lengths of only one. this naturally doesn't make sense, because no paths should have lengths of only one - check and fix.
