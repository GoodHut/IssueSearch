 URL : "https://github.com/astroidmail/astroid/issues/315" TITLE : mark unread emails bold BODY : in 268 we thought about highlighting unread messages at several places in astroid. in saved searches, make unread: x bold if x is larger than 0. make the text of a tab bold if there's an unread mail in it x > 1 in query x/y what do you think? any other occurences where unread mails should be hightlighted? btw, in thread_view unread mails possess the nm-unread css class so everybody can style those emails themselves. see 268 for details.
