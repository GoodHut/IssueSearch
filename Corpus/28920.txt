 URL : "https://github.com/kalessil/phpinspectionsea/issues/527" TITLE : import class naming BODY : when importing classes with general names for example pattern names, for example - builder, factory, repository and etc. suggest to name them as '$previousnamespacepart'. '/' .'$theirname' so 'use illuminate\view\factory;' will be 'use illuminate\view\factory as viewfactory' or if it's use react\eventloop\factory change to use react\eventloop\factory as eventloopfactory or use faker\factory to use faker\factory as fakerfactory and etc.
