 URL : "https://github.com/digirati-co-uk/nui-galway-viewer/issues/24" TITLE : osd settings need a tweak BODY : the osd view is fuzzy at first and only sharpens up again when you zoom in. this behaviour can be an effect of osd defaults. compare the o'shaughnessy memoir in mirador, also osd: http://tomcrane.github.io/scratch/mirador/?manifest=https://iiif.library.nuigalway.ie/manifests/p135/memoir.json this is sharp all the way down.
