 URL : "https://github.com/omeka/omeka-s/issues/1039" TITLE : add modules to transifex BODY : as we get through @patrickmj's passes through the modules for i18n, we should be putting them on transifex. this means deciding on a pattern of where they'll go and then just the little mechanical bits of pushing them up. i'm leaning toward publishing them as resources of the s project on transifex, in the same way they are for classic.
