 URL : "https://github.com/vnguyen70/GTInteractive/issues/35" TITLE : building alternate names BODY : allow users to enter alternate names for buildings in info tab of buildingdetailsactivity? . these are then tokenized and stored in the database perhaps appended to name tokens ? . searching buildings can then search against alt names as well. note: alt names must be stored in a separate table from the buildings table, because if buildings are reloaded from the api, we must save the alt names data somehow and reattach them to the corresponding buildings.
