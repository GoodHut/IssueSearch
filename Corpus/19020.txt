 URL : "https://github.com/muesli/beehive/issues/107" TITLE : web pages updates BODY : is it possibile to have a bee that works in a similar way to the rss bee but for html pages? i'd like to receive updates when a particular search result appears on a web page. however the website i'm interested in doesn't offer any rss functionality. ideally, i would be able to select the html bee, extract all the results perhaps with xpath or css selectors , diff the current elements with the previous elements and send the result to the next bee. is this doable? thanks
