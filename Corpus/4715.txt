 URL : "https://github.com/kvark/vange-rs/issues/24" TITLE : fix mesh holes BODY : holes are caused by the incorrect winding order of vertices, as displayed here: ! vangers-poly-hole https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107301/34342485-91ad3fca-e97f-11e7-9bbb-e389a759b2e8.png i suspect that the flat normals provided in the model are still correct, so we can detect if they point in the opposite direction from a computed flat normal and reverse the winding order in this case.
