 URL : "https://github.com/arkypita/LaserGRBL/issues/195" TITLE : problem resuming job BODY : i usually start from a position away from the machine zero and set a new work/home position. when an error happens, i reset the arduino. after that i run the gcode and i choose to do a resume from the last line sent. it does not resume a job from my stored work/home position. what happens is that it goes to the machine zero x0 y0 correctly and then goes to the last stopped line in absolute machine position and resumes from there as if the machine and work positions are both at x0 y0. that means that it ignores the saved work position that i started with.
