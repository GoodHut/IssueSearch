 URL : "https://github.com/statonlab/hardwoods_site/issues/18" TITLE : comparative genomics work BODY : - add orthogroup exploration function to website will need to rerun with all our species - i think we should do a core orthogroup set from genomes, then add in the transcriptomes through blast or via rerun of the orthogroup software, we can talk about this more - once we have ortholog groups for all the genomes on the website, we can run i-adhore or phyldiag to get structural synteny - visualization of alignments on website . currenty, plan is load alignments as jbrowse tracks, and possibly use the biodalliance synteny viewer
