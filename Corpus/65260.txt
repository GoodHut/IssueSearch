BODY : c/o @mtfang in the attach! method, is it possible to also allow for t and i to be of type array instead of real/integer? this way multiple objects can be attached directly instead of through some for loop or map function. use case example attaching multiple bridges to multiple segments : for j in 1, 6, 8, 10 for k in 0:0.1:1 attach! p12, cellreference default_bridge, rot = π/2 , k, j end end would be: attach! p12, cellreference default_bridge, rot = π/2 , 0:0.1:1, 1, 6, 8, 10
