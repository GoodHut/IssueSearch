 URL : "https://github.com/asoroa/ical2org.py/issues/17" TITLE : creating python3 branch BODY : hi, i started using python 3 exclusively a while ago and just created a branch https://github.com/joonro/ical2org.py/tree/python3 where the code works with python 3. i don't want to create a pr against master because it will break python 2 compatibility, and i think it would be better to have a new branch for python 3. may i ask you to create the branch for this? i will create a pr against the python 3 branch once it is available in the upstream.
