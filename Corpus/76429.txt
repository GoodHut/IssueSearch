 URL : "https://github.com/steemit/steem/issues/1627" TITLE : jsonrpc discoverable api BODY : we would like the jsonrpc plugin have the ability to return what apis are loaded, what methods those apis know of, and what the signatures of the methods are. all of the information is captured when the api is registered. it just needs to be saved in an intermediate form and returned via a local api. the api will not be in a different plugin because we want this api to always be enabled. the methods are: get_apis get_methods get_signatures
