 URL : "https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/NewHorizons/issues/993" TITLE : twilight forest bugs BODY : ok so, the hydra wont take any damage. i killed over 30-40 heads and it just keeps sitting there spasming. random items from my inventory are being eaten by something while i am fighting. random mobs spawning 1hitting me then despawning. tons of random bugs. hopefully add a way to progress without having to deal with these bugs or fix them.
