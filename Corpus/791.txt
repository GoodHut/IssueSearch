 URL : "https://github.com/pcapriotti/optparse-applicative/issues/263" TITLE : no stack ? BODY : sorry if this is a beginner question, but i'm surprised that there seems to be no stack.yaml file to build the lib. i had no issue when doing a stack init on my own. i know that optparse-applicative is a dependency for stack itself, but so is conduit that comes with its own stack file, so i'm not sure there is any circular-dependency problem here. is there any reason for the lack of stack file ?
