 URL : "https://github.com/Looking4Group/L4G_Core/issues/3600" TITLE : prince malchezaar bug BODY : last night, during my guild's karazhan clear, i found a pathing bug during the malchezaar fight. i was able to drag him unto the side of his platform, and when he was up there, he didn't auto attack me. i have attached a screenshot of the bug. i would like to point out that we did not exploit this, didn't even check if exploiting this for an easy kill was possible, but i imagine it might be. ! wowscrnshot_042417_200357 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/27991437/25370325/3d63fab8-298a-11e7-837f-40fde1c766d4.jpg
