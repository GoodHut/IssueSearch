 URL : "https://github.com/UIllLRev/lawreview2016-theme/issues/25" TITLE : post formatting is a pain BODY : right now, the styles for subheads and footnotes depend on the markup that comes with the articles when you use the import .docx option. but when the importer doesn't work or if some were to add a post by hand, it requires going into text mode and adding the html/css by hand. we need a better system. we can extend tinymce the editor wordpress uses and develop methods to easily apply certain tags/classes to things. we should discuss this.
