 URL : "https://github.com/w3c/musicxml/issues/179" TITLE : accidentals not recognized BODY : hi there, i've created a piece of music in sibelius 8.5 and used dolet plugin to export musicxml, which i then imported to logic pro 10.3. everything looks good, until i realized that a punch of accidentals are not recognized, and midi notes are either half-step up or full octave and half step. logic seems to have it's own transposition pre-settings, that were overruling my set concert pitch. but fixing the unrecognized accidentals is still a mystery. any help how to approach this issue, cause i use a lot of accidentals in the sheet music. many tnx, a.
