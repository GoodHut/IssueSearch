BODY : hi, does this support getting the list of reports from a specific workspace? https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt634543.aspx i'm not seeing it in the code base? is this library strictly for displaying reports given that the report id is known? or does it allow you to retrieve a list of reports and then from there display the reports by embedding it? thanks, derek
