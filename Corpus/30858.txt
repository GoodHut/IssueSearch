 URL : "https://github.com/toddproject/todd/issues/138" TITLE : refactoring the api BODY : i have a number of goals both within and outside the todd project that will require the api to be stabilized soon. also, this is just a good idea for obvious reasons beyond my specific ones. the api was one of the more hasty bits of the codebase, so i'm sure there are some gremlins there. here are a few things that need done: - follow some more modern conventions for providing a rest api in go - implement versioning - get rid of that despicable raw tcp socket implementation for getting real-time results. implement something like grpc, and don't force the client to subscribe - make it optional
