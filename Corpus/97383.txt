 URL : "https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/Stormwater-Management-Model/issues/50" TITLE : github branching model.... BODY : i'm not convinced we are using the best branching model for this project. pyswmm brings everything back to the master branch, which i find helpful and simple. this project is inherently different since at least at the moment we are working toward multiple releases of swmm 5.1.13 - bug fixes and 5.2.0 - the new api . seems like people that are new to the project could become quickly frustrated. thoughts?
