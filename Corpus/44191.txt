 URL : "https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/4943" TITLE : enh lock environments BODY : i think it would be a useful feature to have some mechanism to lock environments where a lock means not being permitted to conda install|update|remove packages. i appreciate that chmod could, in principle, be used to achieve the same thing, but i think there would be many advantages to a conda package lock , so long as it was clearly stated that conda lockenv or whatever it might be called was only to stop changes to the set of conda packages that were installed: it did not prevent pip, cran, npm, autoconf, etc. from modifying content inside the environment. maybe this is already possible through package pinning where one just says pin all packages . skimming the docs it looks like this might be sufficient, but i'm not sure. i think it would allow new packages to be installed still, and i'm not sure the effect on removing packages. and in any case it wouldn't be an easy operation for someone who just wanted to say lockdown this environment , rather it would require them doing something like conda list -e >> $conda_prefix/conda-prefix/pinned or something like that not sure the conda list -e output matches what the pinned file is expecting
