 URL : "https://github.com/datajoint/datajoint-python/issues/293" TITLE : provide conda packaging BODY : as you all may know, anaconda is a very popular python packaging environment that aims to simplify the process of getting started using python for scientific computations. anaconda users would use the specialized package management tools conda to discover and install new scientific python packages. unfortunately, making packages available on pypi which is where pip pulls packages from does not make the package available for conda . it would make sense for us to provide datajoint packaging for anaconda.
