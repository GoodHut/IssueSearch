 URL : "https://github.com/iveec/Capstone/issues/5" TITLE : subtlety - classes BODY : great use of general classes like 'classes', 'column', and others to apply common styling to similarly styled sections across the page. try to keep this idea flowing as you continue working on this project and with other projects in the future. some examples in this particular project - look at the 4 main content sections. 3 of the 4 have a larger 60% width left side and a smaller right side. this same styling is set several times throughout the css. can you use general classes here to avoid repeated lines of css? general styling like flex display is used on many sections on the page. would something like a general flex-container class that applies common flex styling be helpful in reducing repeated lines of code? keep an eye out for other opportunities to keep your code dry
