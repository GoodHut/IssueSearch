 URL : "https://github.com/Algo-Web/ODataMetadata/issues/103" TITLE : multiplicities are swapped BODY : when adding a non-many-to-many relation, principal multiplicity seems to end up on the dependent end of things, and vice versa. this seems to happen somewhere in metadatamanager, inside addnavigationpropertytoentitytype method. manually reversing order of calls in the call to createassocationfromnavigationproperty in testbed application looks to correct this - supplied multiplicities end up in their correct location
