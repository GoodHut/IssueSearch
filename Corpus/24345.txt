 URL : "https://github.com/atom/ide-java/issues/21" TITLE : source level error BODY : this line of code java public class fern extends plant implements comparable<fern> is causing this error syntax error, parameterized types are only available if source level is 1.5 or greater the linter is showing this error that can be prevented by disabling this package and restarting atom . however my code compiles fine using javac and runs with no issues as well. my system must be running on source level 1.5 or greater already, not to sure why the package isn't picking up on that.
