 URL : "https://github.com/StrangeLoopGames/EcoIssues/issues/1773" TITLE : odd server activity BODY : i couldn't log in like i was having that odd inactivity error with you cancelled a large project, attempted a few times over 10 min period so i figured i would restart. after restart cpu goes from 4% to 60% ram about 1gb and steady. it had a few crash reports on a restart so i got that but hasn't crashed yet, it shows up as offline nearly right away compared to restarts it would take a moment to show that it's offline. i have tried a backup file but no luck. crashreports.zip https://github.com/strangeloopgames/ecoissues/files/1124050/crashreports.zip game.eco file - https://drive.google.com/open?id=0b3reuklpfvf7wknjrwltblj2tws
