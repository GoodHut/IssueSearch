BODY : thank you for the arduino-softpwm library, i like the way it works. i use it for an atmega8 by adding define timsk1 timsk . the example was confusing for me, because the external definition softpwm_define_extern_object_with_pwm_levels is also defined, but not needed for the example. the example in the loop is not working. my setup takes about 10 seconds, therefor micros has a high value when entering the loop . the for-loop with 'i' stays at '0' and never gets to the next one. a value is added to micros with micros + wait , that introduces the rollover problem. could you rewrite the example and make it much simpler ? for example a ramp up for each output one by one with normal delays.
