 URL : "https://github.com/wyozi/wmc-plus/issues/21" TITLE : permissions do not work BODY : we have a specially-made staffing system where all of our staff departments are merged into four ulx ranks: staffaspirant, staff1, staff2, and staff3. i have it set so any staff can use wmcp's full permissions for event music on our starwarsrp. however, when trying to use the system, it doesn't work, telling you access to 'permission' denied. we don't know what's going on or how to fix this, nor do we have an error code.
