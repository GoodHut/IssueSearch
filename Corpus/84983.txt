 URL : "https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/web-issues/issues/75" TITLE : edit about me enhancement BODY : maybe i'm just blind, but i can't find a link to edit my about me section on the rd site. i know i can do it from the forums side although it just took me a good minute to find the button, blame the wine , but it would be nice to add a button to the main site as well since this is _much_ more visible on the new profile than before.
