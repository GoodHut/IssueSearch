 URL : "https://github.com/ThreeLetters/MiniRequest/issues/1" TITLE : send post data BODY : hey, i've noticed this library, and the strict limitations openagar has. i've tried the original http method:post , but it doesn't work, unless there is an extra step into solving this issue javascript request = data,callback => { // object = {type: i should only see this message when post data is read , data: {}} data = json.stringify data ; var r = new http.request { host: api.opnagar.us , method: post , headers: { content-type : application/json , content-length : buffer.bytelength data }, }, res =>{ res.on data , d =>{ // should return back json object. this.data.log d.tostring ; } ; } ; r.write data ; r.end ; } instead, doing this, it returns the html content of the page, not the content of what is supposed to be given, figured sending data with post isn't possible with http? how to achieve? thanks
