 URL : "https://github.com/knocean/knode/issues/44" TITLE : implement text search BODY : we need to be able to search for terms by their annotations. the two most important annotations for the first implementation are label and alternative term , but we should plan to support annotations with a few paragraphs of text. it should be fast and do a good job of ordering search results. it needs to be able to handle the 2 million labels and alternative terms in the ncbi taxonomy. results must include the term iri and the iri of the matched annotation, along with match information. we should build on an existing system, not reinvent the wheel. it should be pure-jvm, but i don't have a preference.
