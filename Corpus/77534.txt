 URL : "https://github.com/Shippable/support/issues/3708" TITLE : new ui: usability issues BODY : while generally usable, i've found myself frustrated by parts of the new ui. 1 on the dashboard, a job will start in the queued jobs section, then move to the processing jobs section. but when complete it just disappears as such, there is no way to see whether a job i initiated a few minutes ago completed successfully or not without going to the relevant project. this is now getting very annoying. 2 even when i go to the project page i still can't see the status of the recently completed jobs. instead, i get the latest status of each branch, including branches that are very old and not interesting. this simply isn't what i want to know - i usually want to see what has just finished, not the status of each branch. to find the status of a recently completed job i have to click on the highest job number i can see, and then hover over each job number until i find the job i'm actually interested in. the whole process is a slog. 3 the new ui has stolen the ability to right click on my mouse. as such, it is really difficult to open a shippable link in a new window. opening one window for each project is tricky, requiring manually copying the url. i hope this feedback helps and inspires changes, because spending my day fighting the ui isn't a very relaxing way to spend my day!
