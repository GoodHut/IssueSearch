 URL : "https://github.com/riboseinc/rnp/issues/275" TITLE : need of libverify BODY : description libverify was previously used to support rnpv for a very light verification library, but since we're going to merge rnp and rnpv 69 , libverify is no longer useful. @ni4 suggests we should we remove it. what do you think? personally i believe just librnp is good enough, and signing/verification functionality should be placed together.
