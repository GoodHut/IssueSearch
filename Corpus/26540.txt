 URL : "https://github.com/cea-sec/Sibyl/issues/71" TITLE : binary ninja plugin BODY : hi, i wrote a simple binja plugin for using sibyl. as of now i'm running it in a single thread but maybe i'll go the way of your plugin and use subprocess . anyway, if you can add a link to it in your repo it would be very nice : https://github.com/kenoph/binja_sibyl the reason why i did not add it as an ext is that binja requires a plugin.json file in the root of the repo, along with __init__.py ... i don't want to pollute your repo
