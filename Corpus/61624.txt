 URL : "https://github.com/theia-ide/theia/issues/516" TITLE : better support for tmux BODY : tmux https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tmux is a software application that can be used to multiplex several virtual consoles, allowing a user to access multiple separate terminal sessions inside a single terminal window or remote terminal session. it seems that tmux would be a useful tool to use within the theia terminal. however at the moment, there are some things that do not work: - selection seems broken. - probably related, the browser's copy action is often not enabled when something is selected - when by chance the copy action is enabled, what gets copied is not what's currently selected. i have tried tmux in the xterm.js demo application and the above problems are not present.
