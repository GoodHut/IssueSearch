 URL : "https://github.com/Kaja89/Colmar/issues/1" TITLE : class convention in css BODY : i see a lot of combo classes in the css that are used over and over like h-auto + max-width. the current naming conventions in css tend to favor naming classes based on the component they are styling rather that the style they are changing, which is an older convention. the reason for the change is very much being displayed here. with that style you start to bloat your html with each element having many classes. it would probably be worth creating a class that combines the different styles and name it as a component. https://github.com/kaja89/colmar/blob/master/index.html l133
