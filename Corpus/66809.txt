 URL : "https://github.com/jkjustjoshing/vscode-text-pastry/issues/15" TITLE : no multicursor no steps BODY : i wanted to add a range let's say 1 ... 100 . when not using multicursor it only displays 1 and nothing more text pastry on sublime adds 100 lines with all the steps . i don't know the internals but is this because of vscode restrictions? maybe to avoid confusion would be nice to point a small how to or known issues to avoid confusion. thanks for this plugin!
