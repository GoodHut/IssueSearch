 URL : "https://github.com/datasciencebr/jarbas/issues/272" TITLE : bring back elm tests BODY : this repo has a couple of _quasi_ tests using elm-verify-examples . unfortunately when the old elm-doc-test became elm-verify-examples our architecture to generate and run elm tests broke and we simply removed it 5f47f66 . it would be wonderful to have them back running and cleaning up with a single npm test command.
