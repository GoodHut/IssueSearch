 URL : "https://github.com/justintadlock/members/issues/157" TITLE : role labels translations BODY : there was a pr https://github.com/justintadlock/members/pull/156 for translating roles on the user edit/new screen. however, are role labels translated anywhere since 2.0.0? looking back through the code changes, i don't see where they should be getting translated except in one place. i'm thinking that maybe we should run members_translate_role over each role label on their registration in members_register_default_roles . that way, the translations trickle down to any code that calls the label.
