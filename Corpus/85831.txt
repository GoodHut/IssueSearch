 URL : "https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/issues/971" TITLE : foreach performance issue BODY : i am running into some performance issues and i am wondering if i am not using the framework properly or something can be done about this in the source code. in my callstack it looks like the foreach calls are taking up a lot of time: ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2384912/30963390-89a02f3a-a44d-11e7-9dcb-e1b6eb89e836.png from what i have read foreach offers readability but is quite slower in most cases. yet i see that the vuex code has an abundance of foreach calls in it. why is this being used instead of loops with offer quite some performance gains? am i missing something here? the foreach call from my stack comes from this line of code: https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/blob/c87b72f2ff7f65e708c4b59a752ef234d0f28d1f/src/store.js l102 i am hoping someone can shed some light on this. also i didn't use the official issue application because i couldn't properly answer half of the questions for this issue.
