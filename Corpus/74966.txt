 URL : "https://github.com/Radarr/Radarr/issues/2069" TITLE : folder naming rule stuck BODY : description: i originally mistakenly placed the formatting that i wanted for the movie file into the folder rule, which was causing me to end up with folders like: the dark knight 2008 {} {} {} when i realized i had them swapped, i reversed them in the settings. this fixed the movie files, but the folders even after deleting and rescanning, insist on still using the previous setting, as they keep coming out with all those extra braces. where are the settings stored? can i go in an manually fix it? radarr version: 0.2.0.852 logs: didn't see anything relevant in the log file
