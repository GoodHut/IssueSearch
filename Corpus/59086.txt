 URL : "https://github.com/windingtree/wt-js-libs/issues/58" TITLE : test hotelevents class BODY : this appears to be blocked pending work to make testrpc compatible with web3 1.0's websockets implementation of the event api. when that is complete, we can test this, but i believe we will also be able to use the full array of features that come with the promievent object. these will be very helpful for managing ui state i think.
