 URL : "https://github.com/TEAMModding/KalStuff/issues/36" TITLE : walking sticks are op BODY : there is really no reason to not use them in your offhand at all times. i'm thinking maybe they should have a negative effect on the player as a trade-off to traveling easily. a small amount of slowness could work, or it could eat hunger faster. walking sticks should also probably take damage after so much use, so using them _all_ the time would be unnecessary.
