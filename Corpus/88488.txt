 URL : "https://github.com/JamieMason/ImageOptim-CLI/issues/137" TITLE : no such file or directory BODY : i am getting this error: .../bin/imageoptimbashlib: line 284: /tmpimageoptim-cli/index.txt: no such file or directory this is caused by the concatenation: temp_path= ${tmpdir}imageoptim-cli at least on my systems tmpdir is /tmp so it causes a concatenation issue. i understand the slash was removed here: https://github.com/jamiemason/imageoptim-cli/issues/87 but then it should use a proper path concatenation way to account for both existing or missing slash at the end. though multiple slashes should not cause an issue: https://stackoverflow.com/a/24026057
