 URL : "https://github.com/Gidsy/django-geoip-utils/issues/9" TITLE : move to jazzband BODY : i find this package useful and, from the prs, it seems that i'm not the only one. any chance this can be moved to jazzband so that new releases can be easily made to keep it up-to-date with the changes in django? thanks.
