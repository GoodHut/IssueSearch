 URL : "https://github.com/eegsynth/eegsynth/issues/173" TITLE : rethink quantizer module BODY : it is unclear what the quantizer module expects as input and how it maps to the quantized scales. partly this is due to lack of documentation, but also perhaps a bit of an idiosyncratic implementation. i suggest we rethink the module and make it consistent with extended functionality of quatizers in synthesizers: input 1 control value to be quantized 2 attenuation/gain of 1 chromatic range before quantization 3 offset of 1 chromatic transposition before quantization 4 scale iodic, lydic, chromatic, etc 5 offset after quantization transposition in quantized scale, 0-1 will transpose within one octave output 6 quantized control value 7 quantized control value + transposition 5 nice modules such as the microscale by intellijel also allow setting the transposition in 5 to 'within scale', 'same key', 'octave' and the like. but that might be too much for our purposes now :-
