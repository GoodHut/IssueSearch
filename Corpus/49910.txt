 URL : "https://github.com/GoldenGnu/java-dds/issues/8" TITLE : usage with byte array BODY : not so much an issue, but a question. i have a decompressed unity asset bundle where i have raw image data in a byte array. i know the width, i know the height, i know it's dxt5, and i have the raw image data itself it does not include any meta . how can i use this in this case? the only read method i saw in ddsimagereader was wanting an index and some other stuff, and i've no idea what that means in the context of my purely-image-data byte array.
