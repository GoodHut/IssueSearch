 URL : "https://github.com/rkitover/vimpager/issues/214" TITLE : allow key remapping BODY : i don't want q to quit. i have reconfigured vimpager with ~/.vimpagerrc as follows: vim vimpager settings let vimpager_disable_x11 = 1 let vimpager_scrolloff = 0 can we just use vim normally please? unmap j unmap k unmap g unmap w unmap e unmap b unmap n unmap n unmap f unmap f unmap y unmap p unmap z unmap u unmap r unmap q unmap % unmap <c-v> unmap v unmap / unmap ? unmap d unmap <c-f> unmap <c-b> unmap <c-e> unmap <c-y> unmap <c-d> unmap <c-u> unmap <c-n> unmap < unmap > nunmap k nunmap g vunmap k vunmap g vunmap b autocmd bufenter filetype man nnoremap <buffer> <silent> q :execute normal! q source vimrc just cuz and it's not working otherwise source ~/.vimrc as you can see, i just want to use vim. i know you can vim < foobar but i couldn't figure out how to do a few things and vimpager solved them for me. however, i can't remap q to the normal behavior. the problem is man.vim. let's say, for example, i want to open up a man page, record a macro that deletes and/or restructures some of the manual so that i can yank it into the system clipboard for various reasons. there is no way to do that without doing the following once i'm in vimpager: vim :normal! qq inow i am going to do my stuff<esc>+ :normal! q that is really, really annoying. why is q brute-force-mapped to :q no matter how i try to nnoremap it? i have tried to map it after i vimpager starts with :nunmap q , :unmap q , :nnoremap q :execute normal! q and various other things ... why..?
