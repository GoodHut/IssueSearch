when editing an image the media gallery is currently chosen by adding items. i prefer to have a drop down menu where i can see the names of the existing galleries. that is better than adding single letters in the hope of finding out the name of the galleries. the drag and drop option also makes no sense here. additionally there should be a link to add new galleries.
