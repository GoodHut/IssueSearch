 URL : "https://github.com/mikesart/gpuvis/issues/7" TITLE : get rid of trace-cmd BODY : trace-cmd is licensed under gpl while all other dependencies use permissive licenses. this single dependency prevents incorporating this project into other projects which are under permissive license. to make this project more accessible i think trace-cmd should be removed and replaced with something which is under permissive license.
