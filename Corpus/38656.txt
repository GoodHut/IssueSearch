 URL : "https://github.com/kasemir/org.csstudio.display.builder/issues/305" TITLE : properties bombo box BODY : properties combo box should be reworked because currently any bad string can be inputted and the only effect is to have a error logged in console something like the following: enum property 'skin' expects ordinal but received 'wer' . my proposal is: - making the combo box not editable: this clearly states that nothing different from the available choices can be selected; - or validate the user input possibly with auto completion taken from the available values , where invalid text is written in red or red background and, in any case, the previous valid value is retained as soon as the combo box loses the focus.
