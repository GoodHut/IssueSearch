 URL : "https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus/issues/515" TITLE : switch syscall to x/sys BODY : see https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/1364 and https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/31925 ppc64le is skipping some docker integration tests b/c this is broken. they weren't a big deal at the time but now that we know the root cause it would be great to address it. there may be other things wrong for other architectures as well, since syscall is being replaced by x/sys. i'm working on this for runc, and then will try to get to docker/docker, so i figured i would open this as well since we know it's affecting ppc64le there as well.
