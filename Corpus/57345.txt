 URL : "https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-copycat/issues/109" TITLE : problems with tmux 2.4 BODY : since tmux 2.4 currently in development , the way vi key bindings for copy-mode and the dynamics for send-keys have changed. therefore, this plugin currently doesn't work. in case there is anyone interested, i have a fork https://github.com/thalesmello/tmux-copycat that i managed to make it work for copy-mode in vi key bindings emacs would need a bit more of work . i won't open a pull request as that would break compatibility with previous versions.
