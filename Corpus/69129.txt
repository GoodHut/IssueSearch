 URL : "https://github.com/chriskohlhoff/asio/issues/230" TITLE : string_view and vs 2017 BODY : just including these two : c++ include asio/detail/config.hpp include asio/detail/string_view.hpp fails with error directive: string_view is only available with c++17 i.e. one has to build with /std:c++17 or maybe /std:c++latest, which is not always possible: for instance currently this breaks boost due to the use of deprecated std::unary_function stuff in it . interestingly, including either one or the other works, as well as changing the order of the includes. c++ // ok: include asio/detail/string_view.hpp include asio/detail/config.hpp a solution could be to guard the include <string_view> with defined has_cxx17 since it seems that's the macro ms uses in their string_view header.
