 URL : "https://github.com/altair-viz/jupyterlab_voyager/issues/5" TITLE : design: big data ? BODY : there are some data files that are too big to send to the user's browser and operate on them there, either because of network or memory constraints. instead, it would be ideal to have voyager do the aggregations it needs closer to the data, on the server, and just what it needs to render the visualizations to the client. we could use voyager-server https://github.com/vega/voyager-server to offload the visualization recommendation engine to the server, but afaik it still requires transporting all data to the client.
