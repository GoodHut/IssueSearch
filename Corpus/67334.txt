 URL : "https://github.com/NSLS-II/bluesky/issues/740" TITLE : plan names are too long BODY : we have received feedback that it would be nice to provide shorter names for plans like relative_outer_product_scan . i think we should consider changing the names we document and teach. there is no reason we can't support aliases for the existing names indefinitely, so this would not break user code. some ideas: count fine as is scan fine relative_scan -> rel_scan inner_product_scan -> joint_scan outer_product_scan -> grid_scan cc @stuwilkins
