 URL : "https://github.com/synthetos/g2/issues/302" TITLE : build on osx broken? BODY : i'm attempting to build g2core 100.26 with the gshield pinout on my macintosh. i've carefully followed the instructions here: https://github.com/synthetos/g2/wiki/getting-started-with-g2core-development compiling-the-code and: https://github.com/synthetos/g2/wiki/compiling-g2core-on-os-x- with-xcode i clone the github repository to my local drive, open the g2core.xcworkspace project in xcode, select gshield as the target, and hit make. the build succeeds. i flash it to the due which succeeds, but the result doesn't work correctly. talking to the due over the serial port works, and it responds to query commands, but any movement commands do nothing. checking the step, direction or enable pins, they're all low all the time. carl mcgrath sent me a build he did on a linux box, and that works driving the motors, etc. something about the build process on the macintosh is resulting in a non-fiunctional result, even though the build is reporting success. anyone successfully building on osx who can offer advice on how to debug this? thanks! -john knoll
