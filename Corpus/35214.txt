 URL : "https://github.com/wix/stylable-components/issues/289" TITLE : devmode error module BODY : we need to inform library users developers with some errors and warnings form our components, like for example when you send value prop out of range in <numberinput /> or like that. we have vision on how api should be, something quite similar to react itself. i will quote @wtfil: === i suggest to create single function for warnings which will accept strings and throw errors only in dev . js warn 'this is message' ; warn.once 'this is message' ; // will create only one warning like react warnings about keys and cetera . on top of that we might need the formatting js warn 'property %s is not valid', propname ; in cases when we need to reuse messages, i recommend to create separate functions js const propertywarn = propname => warn 'property %s is not valid', propname ; we can make warn function work more like asserts if we will use invariant signature https://github.com/facebook/fbjs/blob/master/packages/fbjs/src/__forks__/invariant.js l32-l36
