 URL : "https://github.com/johnhamelink/mws/issues/4" TITLE : sorting nested queries BODY : just adding this to track a problem i came across when adding product.get_my_fees_estimate/2 - although we're using the correct sorting of params, we don't do any sorting to the nested params. this caused the signature to be incorrect, but can be worked around for now by passing these in using the correct ordering, but ideally we'd sort them.
