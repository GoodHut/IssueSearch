 URL : "https://github.com/olifolkerd/tabulator/issues/223" TITLE : complex json object? BODY : hi there -- love this project. it's incredible! i apologize if this has already been answered -- i exhausted my search-fu before turning here. can you tell me if there is support for complex json objects, and if so how to reference nested values? for instance, by json looks like this: javascript { name : fred jones , extension : 101 , allproperties : { userid : fjones , office : it-110 } } while i can access the name and extension attributes by normal convention, i'm not able to determine how, if possible , to access the items nested under allproperties , such as userid . below is just one of many attempts at reaching for the nested item. javascript columns: {title: url , field: name , sorter: string }, {title: title , field: extension , sorter: string }, {title: litigation manager , field: allproperties.userid , sorter: string } any help you can offer would be much appreciated!! thanks!
