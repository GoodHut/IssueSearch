 URL : "https://github.com/patriksimek/node-mssql/issues/408" TITLE : requests stuck in waiting BODY : we're looking for some help with an intermittent problem where requests are getting stuck in the waiting queue of the pool. based on the metrics we have gathered, the in use count seems to be 0. these numbers are gathered by introspecting the internals of the connection pool object. this is occurring on an azure web app, talking to an azure sql server instance. we have 3 instances of the web app, and so far its always a single instance that locks up like this, so its not just a simple high database load. once the node is in this state, its dead. its only happening on the high traffic production node, but it is not a result of a sudden arrival of requests. an obvious candidate is the connection reset behaviour inside azure, but there's no clear path i can see between this type of error, and a totally blocked pool. once its dead, the waiting queue just slowly gathers size until its reset. is there a known failure case that prevents the node-pool library from using available slots to service waiting requests? this on 3.3.0 of node-mssql.
