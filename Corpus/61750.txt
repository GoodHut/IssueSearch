 URL : "https://github.com/mozilla/network/issues/85" TITLE : bootstrap error message BODY : @gvn i was wondering if there is a default way we treat error handling in bootstrap. ex: does a tooltip show up? does an inline text show up after the field? scenario: if user doesn't check the box accepting the privacy notice, the form can't be submitted. here is what we have in the mockup so far: <img width= 1037 alt= screen shot 2017-02-21 at 2 51 38 pm src= https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/22157921/23188918/678133e0-f845-11e6-86fc-802438f63429.png > if there is a default way please let me know and i'll add it to the mockups, adding our style on top of that. cc: @sabrinang
