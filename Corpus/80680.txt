 URL : "https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-angular/issues/296" TITLE : update / set dynamic uri BODY : i've got things working with a hardcoded url endpoint, but i can't figure out how to set the uri after bootstrapping. i tried networkinterface.use { applymiddleware req: any, next: any { req.uri = '{myurlhere}'; next ; } } ; but that does not seem to work. how do i set / change the uri? my use case: i have a helper repository that wraps apollo for graphql, and the main repo has the url. the main repo sets the urls, and at that point, i need to set the graphql url i don't know it ahead of time, as it is set by a function call with which url to use .
