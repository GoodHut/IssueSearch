 URL : "https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-webapp-webapi-multitenant-openidconnect-aspnetcore/issues/5" TITLE : not authorized on tenant BODY : when i run this application and click signup i'm redirected to login. upon entering the login credentials for a global admin user on a test tenant i get the following login screen error. aadsts50020: user account username from identity provider 'live.com' does not exist in tenant tenant and cannot access the application app id in that tenant. the account needs to be added as an external user in the tenant first. correct me if i'm wrong; but isn't the idea of the signup process to on board new tenants? or have i miscofigured something?
