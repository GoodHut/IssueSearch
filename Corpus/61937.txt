 URL : "https://github.com/quantum-bits/galilee-webapp/issues/196" TITLE : caching issue on server BODY : there seems to be a caching issue, where a cached reading on the server is not being updated if the reading itself is updated. to reproduce the issue: - define a new reading for a given day by in the admin interface - fetch the reading from the public-facing website; do this for a few different versions but not all of them - change the reading in the admin change the verse range, for example - go back to the public facing website the caption displays the correct verse ranges in each case, but verses that are displayed are different for the different versions. ones that were already cached show the old verse ranges, while ones that had not yet been displayed seem to show the correct verse ranges.
