 URL : "https://github.com/IxLahiji/CMPT371Team3/issues/16" TITLE : nunit could not be found BODY : unity test tools containes nunit, when we were writing scripts, they could not find nunit. to try and fix this we tried importing nunit into the project, but then we got an error saying that there were 2 nunits in the project. so we had to take out the one that we just put in because when we took out the one from unity test tools, everything in the package broke.
