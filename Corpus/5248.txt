 URL : "https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/issues/3742" TITLE : move to node 8 BODY : node 8 has now hit lts https://github.com/nodejs/release , so we should consider moving over to having that as the minimum supported version. we're of course already forward compatible, so anyone wanting e.g. perf improvements from node 8 and 9 can already run lighthouse there and get the benefits. however the language improvements are significant http://node.green/ . namely: - async / await maybe worth it for the clarity brought by this alone - object.entries and object.values no more object.keys obj .foreach key => const value = obj key ;... : along with a few other nice things like object rest/spread https://github.com/tc39/proposal-object-rest-spread , string.padstart , string.padend , the exponentiation operator, etc. a mostly organic transition to async/await would probably be best, like we did when we moved to node v6 and only really added destructuring where it made sense of course and where we had some other reason to touch code than just updating to new syntax. we have some tricky promise tricks we use at times and a mass migration could easily miss subtleties though hopefully our tests won't . and promises and async/await play together nicely, so mixing them for the near future won't be much of an issue. i'm personally very eager to move over, but it is worth noting that last time https://github.com/googlechrome/lighthouse/issues/449 we waited until january after the october lts switch to move up versions, so prudence might have us wait.
