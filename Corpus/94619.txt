 URL : "https://github.com/rtfd/sphinx_rtd_theme/issues/379" TITLE : change how we do packaging BODY : currently, prs are expected to grunt build themselves. this leads to a merge conflict problem when there are multiple prs open. we should instead be handling build artifacts on release. the workflow here would be that when it makes sense, a maintainer will release the package, either as a development release or as a prod package. the maintainer will run grunt build , check those artifacts into the repository, the commit will be tagged, and a release to go out to pypi. we can't remove storing artifacts as a number of folks pin their theme dependency here. we can remove the requirement that prs run grunt build , but perhaps find another mechanism for keeping our version on conflict, such as using .gitattributes to use ours on merge.
