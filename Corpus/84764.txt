 URL : "https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/35702" TITLE : docker event for exec_die BODY : description as a container terminate by itself main pid 1 process complete an container die event is reported with exit code. as an exec process completes, docker inspect do report updated execids set but no event is logged. as a result, one only can monitor exec completion by polling. an container exec_die event would allow an asynchronous implementation. my actual use case is to run build processes in an existing containers from a jenkins plugin. i'd like to avoid polling this container for exec completion. steps to reproduce the issue: 1. run docker event 2. start a container with sleep 100 3. run docker exec id echo hello describe the results you received: logged events: - container exec_create - container exec_start - container die describe the results you expected: logged events: - container exec_create - container exec_start - container exec_die - container die
