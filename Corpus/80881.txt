 URL : "https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-connector-soap/issues/82" TITLE : use local wsdl for tests BODY : some of the automated tests rely on the availability of this url: http://www.webservicex.net/stockquote.asmx?wsdl however, when webservicex.net becomes unavailable, ci would fail and affect other repos e.g. loopback-datasource-juggler depending on it. @rashmihunt suggested to have the wsdl locally for the tests.
