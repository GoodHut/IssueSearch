 URL : "https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/16219" TITLE : beta search component BODY : behaviour: - currently the search opens challenge links from the result in new tabs. do we want that? - it displays description, which is bit over whelming, can we hide it or suppress it with a expand + icon? bug: - search does not clear the placeholder test when clicked upon. its cleared when typing starts.
