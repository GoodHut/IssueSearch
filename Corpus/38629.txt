 URL : "https://github.com/sschmid/Entitas-CSharp/issues/255" TITLE : processor vs. system BODY : since i'm already breaking the api here and there for the next release, why not adding yet another controversial proposal: rename systems to processor > es “systems” should be batch-processing algorithms: you give them an array/stream of homogeneous data, and they repeat one algorithm on each row/item. calling them “processors” instead of “systems” reduces confusion. adam ! crazy https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/233700/21786267/650b51d4-d6c3-11e6-9913-aa332675fbcd.jpg
