 URL : "https://github.com/kelseyhightower/confd/issues/535" TITLE : raw json to file BODY : hi, i'm trying to create config file from rancher metadata api. i'm inspiring myself from this project: https://github.com/objectpartners/rancher-container-conf but i just want directly json of the api to the file. this because the application which will use the generated config file use json syntax. i can have with curl: curl --header 'accept: application/json' http://rancher-metadata/2015-07-25/self/service/metadata/config/content { blabla :{ blublu :{ blibli : , bloblo :{ nyark : firstname , name , birthname }}}} but i don't understand what to put in template instead of getv to just get raw json data like curl . this is my rancher-compose.yml file, if this could help you to understand me: version: '2' services: app: metadata: config: path: /config/app.conf content: blabla: blublu: blibli: bloblo: nyark: - firstname - name - birthname scale: 1 start_on_create: true i could just use a curl container to create a file, but i would benefit of confd dynamic update. do you understand me ? is it insane ? : thanks a lot if you try to help me! best regards,
