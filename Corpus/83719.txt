 URL : "https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser/issues/374" TITLE : class constant misspelled BODY : i think there is a typo in the name of this class constant: phpparser\node\stmt\class_::visibility_modifer_mask should be ::visibility_modifier_mask i.e. with an extra i in modifier . this constant is useful for bitwise operations against the other class_::modifier_ values if you want to check or alter the visibility of several node types, so it would be nice to avoid the misspelling propagating.
