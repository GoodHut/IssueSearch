 URL : "https://github.com/storybooks/storybook-addon-knobs/issues/100" TITLE : knobs panel not displayed BODY : i am running a storybook instance and have the component displayed there, but knobs panel is not displayed. the source is very simple: import react from 'react'; import {adddecorator, storiesof} from '@storybook/react'; import hotellist from './hotellist'; import {withknobs, text} from '@storybook/addon-knobs'; const stories = storiesof 'hotellist', module ; stories.adddecorator withknobs ; stories.add 'no params', => <hotellist buttontitle={text 'button title', 'ok' } loadresults={action 'loadresults' }/> ; no error is shown, console is clear of any messages, it displays the component with the default button text 'ok' , but knobs panel is not visible anywhere to enable changing the button title. what's strange, i use storybook at work, and the knobs panel is displayed there, but here on my computer at home, there is no knobs panel.
