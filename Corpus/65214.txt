 URL : "https://github.com/RangelReale/osincli/issues/6" TITLE : improve error reporting BODY : could we improve error reporting for the following code? https://github.com/rangelreale/osincli/blob/fababb0555f21315d1a34af6615a16eaab44396b/client.go l35-l39 otherwise it's hard to understand what's going on and what exactly were missing when client were initialized. a bit of context: we run tests that start a server and tries to use a client to connect to a server. the test fails with the error error: missing configuration - verify you have provided the correct host and port and that the server is currently running. it tells me nothing and that's why i'm asking you about this.
