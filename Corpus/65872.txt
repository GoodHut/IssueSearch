 URL : "https://github.com/pdxrust/meetups/issues/9" TITLE : list of backup speakers BODY : we should have some talks on hand for instances when our originally planned speaker has to cancel. please comment in this issue if you would like to be a backup speaker for the meetup. include the name you should be announced as, and the titles of any talks you'd be comfortable giving. listing yourself here doesn't commit you to speaking at any particular time; it just means you might sometimes be contacted to see whether you're available. thanks!
