 URL : "https://github.com/rucio/rucio/issues/23" TITLE : file download from webui BODY : lots of sites already support webdav downloads, so it would be a nice feature if we would have download directly from the webui. so when users list the files in a dataset their can just click a button and the files / one file would be directly downloaded to their machine. _migrated from jira rucio-1630 https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/rucio-1630 _
