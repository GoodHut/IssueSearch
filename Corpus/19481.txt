 URL : "https://github.com/shalvah/unn-api/issues/2" TITLE : add data filtering BODY : currently the api returns all a students data when a request is successful. this is not always necessary, as sometimes all the developer wants to do is verify the user's identity. we need to implement filtering via a query parameter. i propose ?details= . available values would be: - auth-basic : returns true if user is a unn student, false otherwise - basic : returns the student's department - full : returns all the students details or something along those lines. we could also have the dev manually specify each detail he/she wants.
