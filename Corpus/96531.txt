 URL : "https://github.com/overtools/OWLib/issues/9" TITLE : export of ui sprites/icons BODY : i wasn't sure how to contact you with this question so i hope you are fine with me opening a ticket here. i have been trying to find a way to export the ui elements e.g. the sprites that are used in the killfeed, scoreboard or hud from the game but have not yet found an obvious path to do that. is there any easy way to get them through overtool ? cheers
