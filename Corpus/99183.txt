 URL : "https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/1057" TITLE : markdown preview for notes BODY : it'd be great to have support for previewing markdown in the notes section for added formatting. one could possibly have a ui similar to github where you have write and preview tabs to toggle between. cmark https://github.com/commonmark/cmark could be used as the markdown interpreter, and qtwebengine could be used as the previewer or use native windows and macos web controls wrapped in qt .
