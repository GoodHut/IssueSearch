 URL : "https://github.com/SilenceIM/Silence/issues/539" TITLE : encrypted messages lost BODY : encrypted messages lost since i encountered many lost messages since i started using silence and nothing changed over various versions, i'm now writing this issue. the messages seem to get lost occasionally on encrypted sms. the option for the 'delivery report' is enabled. both check marks are shown next to the lock symbol for every send sms. on most cases my chat partners do not receive the messages, sometimes i don't receive their messages. the android versions and mobiles phones differ from stock android 5.x to 7.x, so i doubt it has anything to do with android but rather with the app itself ... anyone else having this issue?
