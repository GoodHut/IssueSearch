 URL : "https://github.com/mwdossantos/squadron/issues/81" TITLE : save game issue BODY : when you get to save the game and load it back up, all the dinos you discovered in dna are locked again in hatchery. the ones you made before the save are still roaming around the park. some dinos are out of their enclosure, you can't interact with these. if you try to take control you get locked into only being able to control camera.
