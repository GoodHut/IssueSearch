 URL : "https://github.com/supertuxkart/stk-code/issues/2722" TITLE : make all karts equal again BODY : it may make the game less complex, but that seems like what you want. it is almost impossible to create tracks to make it fairer for all, so stop trying. and it is annoying in multiplayer if one player has a small advantage over the other.
