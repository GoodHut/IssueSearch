 URL : "https://github.com/SplitterAlex/raspberrycoffee/issues/1" TITLE : documentation for cci/csi BODY : hi alexander, sorry for opening this as an issue, but i did not find a way to directly contact you. i'm currently also working on implementing a cci/csi interface on a coffeemachine, and i was wondering where you obtained your documentation. so far searching for cci/csi-protokoll, schnittstellen norm fur ausschankanlagen und kreditsysteme. version 3.4 does not yield any results for me. i found this document: http://wiki.etcworld.be/uploads/pdf/koffie/csi_1_manual.pdf but it does not help me a lot. your bachelor thesis however has been great, there is a lot of good information in there! that's why i was wondering if you could point me to the right place to find the documentation. best regards,
