 URL : "https://github.com/fluffos/fluffos/issues/349" TITLE : array reserved word BODY : my understanding is this particular feature of the mudos/fluffos line has been removed but i would like to see it back since no simple text substitution currently can easily replace it since it means two different things in the language depending on context: 1 array c; // this is a valid statement and one has to substitute mixed for it if array is removed. 2 int array b; // this is also a valid statement and one has to substitute for it if array is removed. finding all such instances is non trivial for a mud admin and breaks compat with many existing mudlibs including dead-souls foundation and nm , lpuni, i believe lima and perhaps even discworld.
