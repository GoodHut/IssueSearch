 URL : "https://github.com/zeit/hyper/issues/1603" TITLE : error updating plugins BODY : <!-- once those are done, if you're able to fill in the following list with your information, it'd be very helpful to whoever handles the issue. --> - os version and name : windows 10 - hyper version : 1.2.1 - node version : 6.10.0 - npm version : 3.10.10 - the issue is reproducible in vanilla hyper app : fresh install on os x and windows both fail with this error every time i start hyper issue i've seen this mentioned in some old tickets but didn't find a suitable resolution. in my case a fresh install today on two machines/operating systems gives me this error every time i start hyper out of the box error updating plugins check '~/.hyper_plugins/npm-debug.log' for more information however that file does not exist. i figured 2 of machines can't be configured incorrectly enough to break your application so worth reporting
