 URL : "https://github.com/bvalosek/infusionsoft-api/issues/12" TITLE : .done crashes node BODY : the bug is with .done on line 290 in lib/queryable.js. if xml-rpc fails to parse and throws an error, when it falls into this done it will create a uncatchable segment fault in the app and shut it down. this is a flaw in the way .done works with promises. unfortunately since infusionsoft often throws non xml rpc responses it can cause node crashes extremely often. in order to resolve the issue it needs to be replaced with a .then and .catch as apposed to .done.
