 URL : "https://github.com/ccny-ros-pkg/imu_tools/issues/81" TITLE : pitch/roll yaw dependent BODY : i am using the complementary filter on a custom board. using the mpu-9255. when i examine the quaternion, it seems that the pitch and roll axes swap based on yaw. i am basing this on the invensense teapot graphing routine that i have used with numerous quaternion visualiations. it works as expected when i pass the data as enuminto the madgwick imu_filter implememtation in the github, but behaves very strangely when i pass nwu data into the complementary filter. i would appreciate any pointers, as i have paired it back to the gyro based prediction step. thanks!
