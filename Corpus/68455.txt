BODY : hi, first of all, thanks for this great code! i've tried fire homekit2mqtt up via and putty shows: sudo homekit2mqtt warning the program 'node' uses the apple bonjour compatibility layer of avahi. warning please fix your application to use the native api of avahi! warning for more information see <http://0pointer.de/avahi-compat?s=libdns_sd&e=node> warning the program 'node' called 'dnsserviceregister ' which is not supported or only supported partially in the apple bonjour compatibility layer of avahi. warning please fix your application to use the native api of avahi! warning for more information see <http://0pointer.de/avahi-compat?s=libdns_sd&e=node&f=dnsserviceregister> 2017-11-08 16:03:20.374 <info> homekit2mqtt 0.7.2 starting 2017-11-08 16:03:20.384 <info> mqtt trying to connect mqtt://127.0.0.1 2017-11-08 16:03:20.595 <info> using hap-nodejs version 0.4.36 2017-11-08 16:03:20.622 <info> loading homekit to mqtt mapping file /usr/local/lib/node_modules/homekit2mqtt/example-homekit2mqtt.json 2017-11-08 16:03:20.736 <info> hap created 10 accessories 2017-11-08 16:03:20.737 <info> hap publishing bridge mqtt bridge username=cc:22:3d:e3:ce:f6 port=51826 pincode=031-45-154 2017-11-08 16:03:20.852 <info> hap bridge listening on port 51826 2017-11-08 16:03:20.853 <info> http server listening on port 51888 2017-11-08 16:03:20.882 <info> mqtt connected mqtt://127.0.0.1 after the last line, there is an empy line but no cursor. in other words, this putty window is now useless but i guess i have to keep it open to keep homekit2mqtt running. is there any way of running the program in background mode? i tried the usual '&' sign on the end but to no avail. sorry if the solution is obvious but i am kind of stuck. thank you in advance.
