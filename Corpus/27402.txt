 URL : "https://github.com/the1laz/cgateweb/issues/10" TITLE : custom mqtt mapping BODY : i've got an mqtt server that integrates lots of things inside our house, plus a c-bus edlt which i'd like to use to interact with non-c-bus devices. would you consider expanding cgateweb to include the possibility of publishing custom mqtt topics? for example, i could add an enable switch to the edlt and map it to /outdoor/gates which would then mean i could open my gates via c-bus. just a thought :d.
