 URL : "https://github.com/akxcv/vuera/issues/15" TITLE : usage with vuex BODY : is there any way to maintain the $store vuex instance property that's provided by vuex? my app is a vue application that uses vuex for state management, but after reaching a react component that has vue components as children, those components no longer have access to the vuex store. outside of that i'm loving it so far, very easy to integrate with presentational components that don't need access to state, i'm just running into this issue on components requiring access to global state. :
