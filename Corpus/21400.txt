 URL : "https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/3900" TITLE : feature histograms BODY : a nice feature would be to support histogram charts, or alternatively, update the bar chart so that a histogram can be manually created given the right data. at the moment it seems like a bar chart only can represent value-category pairs, while a histogram would require the bars to be drawn at the right positions on a numerical/linear axis.
