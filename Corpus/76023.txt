 URL : "https://github.com/electron/electronjs.org/issues/917" TITLE : improve the contact page BODY : the /contact page https://electronjs.org/contact currently lists a number of ways to get in touch, but does not clearly define what people should expect from each channel, or how they should interact with it: - github @electron - twitter @electronjs we pretty much never respond to replies using @electronjs, in favor of our personal accounts - slack atomio.slack.com not frequented by most electron team members - discuss discuss.atom.io/c/electron also not frequented by team members - email electron@github.com currently a dumping ground, mostly spam let's make the page more actionable, like: - to report a bug or request a feature for electron, open an issue in electron/electron - to report a security incident, email security@electronjs.org - to report a violation of the code of conduct, email coc@electronjs.org - to add your app to the site, open a pr on the electron-apps repo - etc..
