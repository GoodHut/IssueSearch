 URL : "https://github.com/origo-map/origo/issues/354" TITLE : optional map grid BODY : i think it should be able to select whether you want the map grid visible or not. if for instance you select to not have a background map visible, you might not want the grid to be visible either. also if you have a background map with a transparent background, you might not want the grid enabled.
