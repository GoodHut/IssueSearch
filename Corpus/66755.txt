 URL : "https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/5444" TITLE : ng eject breaks routing BODY : if i try routing before ejecting the webpack, it works as expected. as soon as you do ng eject, the application does compiles and runs, but router does not work. the first call is routed properly, but if you try to refresh or navigate to other route, the application returns cannot /get route. any suggestions?
