BODY : guys, there are lot's of very cheap infrared controlled bulbs out there. any body like the idea of added ir support to this project? there would of course be some limitations as ir typically has specific codes for a reduced set of colours and there is always the sync issue when the same code is used for on and off. however, with a simple ir transmitter ir transmitter led, a resister and maybe a transistor we could have limited control over ir bulbs aswell... andy.
