 URL : "https://github.com/stakach/IIS-X-Sendfile-plugin/issues/9" TITLE : .net only? global? BODY : i haven't been able to get this plugin to work with coldfusion yet. must this be configured only as a per-site application w/bin in each root directory ? is it possible to integrate it as a global module? i use coldfusion 10 & 2016 w/iis 8.5 & 10 and both use tomcat/java. i'd like to use x-sendfile to eliminate locking up coldfusion threads during long/slow file downloads. i know that some cf devs use unix/apache, but some iis installations have successfully used boncode iis connector http://www.boncode.net/boncode-connector or helicon ape's x-sendfile http://www.helicontech.com/ape/doc/mod_xsendfile.htm to add x-sendfile capability. i currently use iis webspeed https://www.iiswebspeed.com/ & iis brotli https://www.iisbrotli.com/ modules and am able to configure them globally for all websites. iis webspeed has customized .config files in each root directory. brotli has no options other than global mime types. regarding http response headers, i currently add headers using coldfusion so that iis webspeed's behavior can be modified after the content is returned from tomcat and returned to iis for delivery. i'd like to be able to do this with iis-x-sendfile-plugin, but i don't want to have to manually configure this in iis manager for every site. can support be added for a root .config files or have it be configured as a global setting? i'm not even sure if you are working on this anymore. thanks.
