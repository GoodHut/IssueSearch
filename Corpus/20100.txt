 URL : "https://github.com/nodejs/citgm/issues/440" TITLE : blog post on citgm BODY : i was talking to @mhdawson , and we were thinking that it might be a good idea to write something about citgm for the node blog. it'd be great to get some more people interested in citgm, especially module authors. it's also a good way to get started in core if you have experience writing npm modules. it's also a pretty cool thing to talk about in general, i know rust has crater https://github.com/brson/taskcluster-crater , which does the same thing and is also an npm module! but other than that it's pretty unique. thoughts @nodejs/citgm ?
