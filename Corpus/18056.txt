 URL : "https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged/issues/340" TITLE : setup debug logs? BODY : most of the issues which are created do not have enough info required to identify the root cause. so how about integrating debug https://github.com/visionmedia/debug ? we could request users to run lint-staged with a --debug flag in our issue template. not entirely sure how this would work with verbose option though. if @okonet and @luftywiranda13 are in agreement, i can work on this.
