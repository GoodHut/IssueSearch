 URL : "https://github.com/osresearch/heads/issues/116" TITLE : iso9660 not supported BODY : it would be nice to be able to install qubes from dvd. the qubes maintainers note the advantage of optical media https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/install-security/ : write-resistance. that reduces the risk of installation media being tampered with. however, the iso 9660 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iso_9660 file system is not supported in heads. if possible, can support for it be added? if not, then this limitation should at least be documented, to avoid users wasting time burning a qubes install dvd and trying to install from it using heads. ask me how i know this! :wink:
