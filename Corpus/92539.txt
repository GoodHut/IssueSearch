 URL : "https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/issues/8437" TITLE : yoast seo stopped working BODY : x i've read and understood the contribution guidelines https://github.com/yoast/wordpress-seo/blob/trunk/.github/contributing.md . x i've searched for any related issues and avoided creating a duplicate issue. please give us a description of what happened. yoast seo stopped working for no reason at all, nothing works except for the go premium link, which i find quite interesting and at the same time disturbing. any reasonable person might see that as being forced to upgrade to yoast premium. if this is the case, then it would need to be advertised as such, that you get a three week free trial, then in order to continue using it, you have to upgrade. in order to validate these assumptions, i will have to check that with a new profile and website to see if this is consistent. if i am wrong in my experience and related assumptions, please advise on how to correct this issue. please describe what you expected to happen and why. i expected yoast seo to be a stable plugin and to continue working. i did not expect it to just shut down 3 weeks after it is downloaded and activated. how can we reproduce this behavior? 1. install yoast seo on a new website; 2. use it for 3 weeks. technical info wordpress version: 4.9.1 yoast seo version: 5.9.1 relevant plugins in case of a bug: no relevant other plugins. all were deactivated and yoast seo still was not functional. ! yoast - go premium https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34348853/33732023-080bc438-db53-11e7-8d21-d2e633b8ed82.jpg ! yoast non-functional https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34348853/33732022-07f33ecc-db53-11e7-8e19-175198219b08.jpg ! yoast - go premium link https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34348853/33732225-b8496d6e-db53-11e7-88c2-fd1ccfb5dd3d.jpg regards, vid
