 URL : "https://github.com/davestanley/MultiDimensionalDictionary/issues/67" TITLE : convert to handle class BODY : this enables mdd objects to be passed by reference instead of passed by value, thus saving a lot of memory for large objects. this also allows objects to be modified without having to return the object. finally, it allows listeners/events/callbacks in subclasses, which would be useful for gimbl-vis. if itâ€™s not a handle class, no subclasses can be handle classes.
