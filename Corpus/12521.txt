 URL : "https://github.com/norbertvdberg/iotaseed/issues/3" TITLE : potential scam ? BODY : looks like this github was linked and referenced in a recent discussion on reddit. without passing judgement, it appears as though a user is accusing this application as being fake / a scam and indicates that it generates the key in such a way they say the same every time that allows the creator of this application to steal their crypto currency. this issue is being posted as a warning. i am not casting judgement in either direction, the link to the discussion is below, please be careful and always do your own research. https://www.reddit.com/r/iota/comments/6ytm9v/i_got_hacked_right_after_creating_a_wallet/
