BODY : hey friend. i have a p2p wire protocol question. i have been building my own implementation. i have been simulating responses from other p2p programs to test and i canâ€™t get passed the handshake. i get a handshake: buffersize!: 68 protocol type: bittorrent protocol infohash: aff8bda8adebdab34e1af9ac648bd93c13ed6344 peerid: 2d4c54313030302d764874743153546a4d583043 then i try sending a handshake back or a interested or any other code... do you have any advice? thanks, connor. p.s. - you have something very strange in my mind... you set the protocol buffer like this: '\u0013bittorrent protocol' but that's strange in my mind because it should be \u0019. the string is 19 bits! so how does your implementation even work?! you must be getting the majority of success from ws rather then tcp.
