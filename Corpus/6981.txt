 URL : "https://github.com/mcandre/vagrant-macos-homebrew/issues/1" TITLE : correct the lie BODY : the mcandre/macos-homebrew box cannot actually be exported for reuse. my stomach turned after purchasing both vmware and the vmware vagrant plugin, only to learn that vagrant lacks basic export functionality for vmware-provided boxes. it's like if you went to a stationary store and paid $70 usd for a special 2 pencil, and when you took it with you to your final exams, you realize this pencil is so feature lacking that it can't even be sharpened enough to write with. theories for working around this severe limitation: x recommend that downstream users insert all necessary modifications at the top of a bootstrap.sh script and have their vagrantfile run config.vm.provision shell , path: bootstrap.sh , privileged: false at the beginning of every vagrant up . nope, this option is so crappy that it would be better to go with 100% from-scratch packer builds. copy macos.json packer configuration, add additional provisioning scripts to install homebrew. this pattern quickly gets old considering the number of possible user configurations. hack together a virtualbox-provided vagrant box for macos, import it here, and then export that box. this still sucks, as packer virtualbox code is so bad it hardcodes linux scancodes and so cannot pass keyboard keys to mac guests. and yet it's still the least sucky option available.
