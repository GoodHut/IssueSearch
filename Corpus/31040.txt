 URL : "https://github.com/hoaproject/Fastcgi/issues/22" TITLE : resolve class names BODY : hi, this project looks really great. my problem is not an issue in the library itself but more a ux issue of the code. the problem is simply that phpstorm can not resolve some class relations i.e. the connection class in hoa\socket\client . i guess the reason is because there is a method consistency::flexentity which sets class aliases. so i simply want to let you know that this problem exists and whether its not simpler to use the actual class names in the code?
