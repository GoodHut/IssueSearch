 URL : "https://github.com/AdaptiveConsulting/ReactiveTraderCloud/issues/557" TITLE : not working out of the box BODY : hi, apologies upfront if this is an pre existing issue or if i am doing something wrong - which is most likely . i clone the repo, and then it is a matter of pointing to the launcher project and start it. sure i get the process running but they all have a lot of error messages. i assumed you have some kind of mock data underneath so that one has a ready solution but i presume that might not be the case. there are some instructions, but i am unsure if that fixes any of that. previously i am sure this or the reactivetrader solution worked out of the box.
