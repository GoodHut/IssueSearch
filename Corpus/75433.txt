 URL : "https://github.com/rauchg/slackin/issues/309" TITLE : heroku application error BODY : hello, i just setup heroku and provided the necessary api info, etc. when i try to access, i'm seeing the following: 2017-05-25t12:34:59.443839+00:00 heroku router : at=error code=h10 desc= app crashed method=get path= / host=mxeslack.herokuapp.com request_id=1691e64e-8b12-4621-9298-aba6804da673 fwd= 74.138.35.21 dyno= connect= service= status=503 bytes= protocol=https based on what i read below, this stems from the account used not being an admin. my question is: can slackin/heroku be used w. a free slack team? i'm not finding anywhere to create a new @slackin-inviter account, so that's what keyed me into thinking this may not work with the free team. regards, eric
