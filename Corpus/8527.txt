 URL : "https://github.com/Flaredown/FlaredownEmber-2/issues/345" TITLE : patterns charts BODY : right now our history shows every trackable a user is tracking. - it's hard to see correlations between charts that are not next to each other - loading literally hundreds of trackables can be very slow or even crash the app in some cases proposed solution: let users choose sets of trackables that are grouped together into charts called patterns . here is a clickthrough prototype of the user creating and viewing their first pattern: https://www.figma.com/proto/fq91hmylkvwyaugr5ofihi7z/fd-patterns?scaling=contain the specific design of the charts is flexible, if we want to use an existing libraries that look different or have slightly different functions, that's fine. chart setup screens: - empty state for history page see screen 1 of the prototype - create/edit pattern page see screens 2 and 3 of the prototype chart functionality: - chart is responsive to different screen sizes and accepts touch input - charts can be navigated in time - chart time window can be changed to show greater periods of time - when the user taps the chart a scrubber and units are shown see screen 5 of the prototype - key/legend that shows the contents of the chart
