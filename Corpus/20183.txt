 URL : "https://github.com/51zero/eel-sdk/issues/298" TITLE : bug in sink action BODY : if the writer threads in the sink action pick up an error, they will catch it, close the stream and count down the latch. however, if there is only one thread or they all get an error then the buffer that the subscriber is publishing to will fill up, so the subscriber will blocking. the program will then never progress past this in order to exit from the sink.
