 URL : "https://github.com/fguillot/picoFeed/issues/333" TITLE : support for json feed BODY : probably a bit too early to say whether this is something to stay, but perhaps it's a good idea to mention. there is a new syndication format in town, json feed https://jsonfeed.org/ . maybe it's worth to keep an eye on. feel free to close if you disagree :smiley: p.s. maybe format developers, @brentsimmons and @manton would like to contribute :wink:
