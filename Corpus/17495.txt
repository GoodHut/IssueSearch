 URL : "https://github.com/GeoloeG/dom-repeat-n/issues/7" TITLE : polymer 2 support BODY : hello! :wave: i find dom-repeat-n very useful, and i have implemented it in several of my projects. i'm now porting those projects to polymer 2, and would like to continue using dom-repeat-n . i see that work has begun on upgrading this element to polymer 2, but it seems that more work still needs to be done. is there a list of remaining tasks i could help out with?
