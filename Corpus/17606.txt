 URL : "https://github.com/Cycling74/gen-plugin-export/issues/3" TITLE : python script bug BODY : this came in from a user to me via email: > iâ€™ve noticed that there is an issue with the python export script. if i change channelconf, or i presume any exportscriptargs, i have to export the gen code twice for the changes to propagate through into the xcode project. something to do with the temp jucer file, methinks. this will be on the juce5 branch as it currently stands. perhaps it also applies to the master though?
