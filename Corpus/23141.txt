 URL : "https://github.com/JamieScanlon/AugmentKit/issues/1" TITLE : not an issue - fyi BODY : i'm working on an existing scenekit + arkit universe app in spare time https://github.com/thumbworks/augmentedsolarsystem + https://github.com/johndpope/solarsystem-1 but i'm thinking that using a 3d framework may not be best option and this framework caught my eye. i reviewed some of the code here https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/cosmographia.html and here https://github.com/stellarium/stellarium and it seems these heavy duty universe apps create a virtual world without a 3d scene.
