 URL : "https://github.com/docker-library/httpd/issues/47" TITLE : custom configure switches BODY : i am running httpd with different configure switches than the official images. i am also compiling and including the latest mod security http://www.modsecurity.org/download.html . is it valuable to have this image accept a list of configure switches? right now, i have just forked the dockerfile, but could see this as a relevant use case that i would rather contribute to upstream in this project.
