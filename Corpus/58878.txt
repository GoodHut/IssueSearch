 URL : "https://github.com/empira/PDFsharp/issues/22" TITLE : support for imagesharp BODY : for cross-platform applications i.e. .net core 2.0 i'd suggest to add the support for imagesharp https://github.com/sixlabors/imagesharp as graphics interface. i've been able to make it working, but that was because someone else https://github.com/groege/pdfsharpcore made it work before me! the current mine is somewhat meant as temporary until a better implementation will be available. let me know if you're interested in my attempt.
