 URL : "https://github.com/Darkosto/InvasionIssues/issues/197" TITLE : ranged pump not working BODY : version 1.0.5 of invasion. for some reason ranged pumps are not working. it's saying that its scanning a block that has a liquid. however the tank attached is not filling up. this is because the the internal tank is not being filled with the liquid despite the ranged pump attempting to pump it as viewed from the one probe . to recreate viewable via the one probe bauble : 1. place down a ranged pump near the ocean. 2. power it however you like. 3. add a redstone signal using a lever at this point you can see that its not filling the internal tank via one proble. you can try removing the water from the pump via tank or pipe, not trusting the bauble, but nothing will come out. i've tried this on water and lava and it does the same thing. i didn't have this issue before the last update, fyi.
