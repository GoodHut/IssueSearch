 URL : "https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/issues/6361" TITLE : set s3 file prefix BODY : i'm currently using rocketchat with file uploads to s3 powered by minio , and this works great. but i'd love to be able to set the prefix/directory the files are stored in. currently it uses the hostname of the rocketchat install, but if that could be replaced or prefixed, then i would be able to group all files of 1 client of different applications inside a single directory. would this be possible? thanks
