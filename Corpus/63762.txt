BODY : hi, i'm using gphoto2 on raspberry pi device and control the camera remotely, over ssh connection. unfortunately, something went wrong and i can't take pictures anymore. gphoto2 --auto-detect shows nothing gphoto2 --summary shows: pi@raspberrypi:~ $ gphoto2 --auto-detect error: no camera found. for debugging messages, please use the --debug option. debugging messages may help finding a solution to your problem. if you intend to send any error or debug messages to the gphoto developer mailing list <gphoto-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>, please run gphoto2 as follows: env lang=c gphoto2 --debug --debug-logfile=my-logfile.txt --summary please make sure there is sufficient quoting around the arguments. assuming that the camera hasn't turned off - is it possible to reset the usb connection without unplugging the cable manually? can i check if the camera is on? any suggestions? thank you in advance!
