 URL : "https://github.com/nikolaswise/web-design-workshop/issues/78" TITLE : synth u been gone BODY : bonus good website! http://www.thevendingmachine.net/ url i just wanted everyone to see this. the site fades a droning synth chord in and plays beautiful ambient notes when the user hovers over the prints that are for sale. it's a delight to play with. information about the artist is easy to find and it pops up over the site when the user clicks on his name. when the user clicks on a print, the background chord crossfades into a different chord seamlessly.
