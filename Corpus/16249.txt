 URL : "https://github.com/S2E/s2e-env/issues/49" TITLE : image build error BODY : i been trying to build any of linux s2e image using s2e image_build but all seem to fail unsuccessfully. cd /home/jtumina/s2e/images/.tmp-output/decree-cgc-cfe-i386/decree-cgc-cfe && mv config-i386 .config /home/jtumina/s2e/source/guest-images//linux/docker/run-docker.sh linux-build-i386 /home/jtumina/s2e/images/.tmp-output/decree-cgc-cfe-i386/decree-cgc-cfe /home/jtumina/s2e/source/guest-images//linux/docker/make-kernel.sh /home/jtumina/s2e/source/s2e-linux-kernel/include 98323 98323 working dir: /home/jtumina/s2e/images/.tmp-output/decree-cgc-cfe-i386/decree-cgc-cfe /bin/bash: /home/jtumina/s2e/source/guest-images/linux/docker/make-kernel.sh: no such file or directory /home/jtumina/s2e/source/guest-images//makefile.linux:150: recipe for target '/home/jtumina/s2e/images/.stamps/decree-cgc-cfe-i386' failed make: /home/jtumina/s2e/images/.stamps/decree-cgc-cfe-i386 error 127 make: waiting for unfinished jobs.... yet, i checked and make-kernel.sh does exist in that directory. why would it be unable find such file? i did see an earlier issue 30, who had a similar error and the response was either to try in their home directory or use s2e image_build -d . this is in my home directory and unfortunately -d option will not work for me as i am on a corporate network with required proxy servers that i am unable to seem to configure to be used with the google api call to download the image.
