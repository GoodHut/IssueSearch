 URL : "https://github.com/Kaniwani/KW-Backend/issues/300" TITLE : api level fully unlocked BODY : when making a request to /api/v1/level/ the response includes a locked boolean. however, when this is false, there is no indication if the level has 1, 5, or all items locked. the api response when unlocking part of a level includes a fully_unlocked boolean. ideally the level response should include: { level: 1, locked: false, fully_unlocked: true, / rest / }
