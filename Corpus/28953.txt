 URL : "https://github.com/rapidcore/issues/issues/10" TITLE : improve mongodb api BODY : the current api in rapidcore.mongo is a first draft. since it was designed we have used it in a couple of projects, which has taught us some things - we should use those learnings to improve the api : learnings: - iasynccursor is tricky to mock as most of the methods on it are extension methods. maybe we can wrap it in a thin layer to make mocking easier. - keep the getcollection method, as it makes it possible to use all the low-level features of mongo. - find good ways to make it easier to work with queries that requires a focus on performance. often these will push the work to mongo i.e. queries where we do not have a full instance of an entity.
