 URL : "https://github.com/r0wbrt/YASDRR/issues/27" TITLE : support stepped chirp BODY : support step chirp pulse compression. in step chirp pulse compression, the radar sends out multiple pulses with increasing or decreasing frequency. after collecting all the pulses and their associated returns, the radar does a fft over each bin. the end result is similiar to chirp based compression however this method as the benefit of listening over a narrower range of bandwidth reducing noise. it also has the benefit of being able to selectively listen to frequencies as different times if other interfering frequencies are present. the downside is that before the radar can form an image, it must sample each range first and then combine them.
