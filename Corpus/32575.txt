 URL : "https://github.com/zertrin/duplicity-backup.sh/issues/164" TITLE : version file issues BODY : 1. the new version file makes an external dependency for the script. previously it worked fine standalone. 2. version is a very generic filename, may potentially clash with other software, and is difficult to relate to this script when loaded in directories with other files. suggestion: put the version number in the script itself.
