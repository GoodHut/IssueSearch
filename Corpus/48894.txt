 URL : "https://github.com/cortex-lab/KiloSort/issues/82" TITLE : st3 variable is empty BODY : i'm trying to run kilosort on 6 channels of data collected on single wires. three of these channels are extremely noisy. one has a single very high rate cell. one has 2 cells, and one has at least one cell, but perhaps more. i input kcoords values such that each channel is its own group. the data are in a binary file. ops.nneighpc=1 ops.nneigh=1 ops.whiteningrange=6 ops.maskmaxchannels = 1 all other values are default. i get an error when i run fullmpmu. specifically, st3 is empty and i get an index exceed matrix dimensions for: ~, isort = sort st3 :,1 , 'ascend' ; i tried using an if statement to skip the line if st3 is empty, but the problem propagates down the code. what is variable st3 supposed to hold? what does it mean that it's empty? thanks for your help on this!
