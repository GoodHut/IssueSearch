 URL : "https://github.com/raatmarien/red-moon/issues/130" TITLE : master on/off not working BODY : hi there, maybe related to this issue https://github.com/raatmarien/red-moon/issues/128 also began with 2.10.0 on fairphone 1 although android 4.2.2 , but not resolved with 2.10.1 update the timer is switching the filter on and off successfully but the master switch does not turn the filter on or deactivate it when the timer has activated it. peculiar is that adjustment of the filter settings temporarily adds the overlay until the slider is released, whether the master switch is on or off. reinstalling hasn't solved this. great app and thank you
