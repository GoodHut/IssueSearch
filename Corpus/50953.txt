 URL : "https://github.com/dhlab-basel/Knora/issues/532" TITLE : add handle.net support BODY : we need to be able to communicate with our handle server so that we can add new entries during resource creation. also, we should maybe store the handle id as a property with every resource. further, i would prefer if the webapi server can make sure the entries are in sync, by periodically checking and resyncing if necessary.
