BODY : hi, i was wondering if i could tweak the code so that the rnn-based downbeat detection could become faster. ..by using lower fps and smaller number of band, and perhaps downsample the signal to some extent. but i'm afraid it won't make sense since rnn was trained with those parameters. am i correct? i was also thinking if i'd trained one by myself. if all the dataset were nicely merged into one, i'd be already doing it.. :
