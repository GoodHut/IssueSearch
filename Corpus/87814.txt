 URL : "https://github.com/kroitor/ccxt/issues/56" TITLE : market property: balances BODY : i would like to see a new market property called balances, that would function the same way as symbols. when you call fetchbalances , then the balances property would get filled with an associative array of currencies with balances free, used, total, available, etc. . balances would also be updated via websocket when available or by repeated calls to the api, depending on rate limits. ultimately, we could do something like: kraken.fetchbalances ; let myavailablebtc = kraken.balance.available 'btc' ; let mytotalbtc = kraken.balance.total 'btc' ;
