 URL : "https://github.com/LoneGazebo/Community-Patch-DLL/issues/3524" TITLE : temple of artemis BODY : the latest beta thread was going in a different direction, so i thought i would copy this comment by ziad here so it doesn't get lost. in short, i agree that the granary now feels out of place. > hey gazebo, i have a question that has been bugging me for a while. > > why is temple of artemis the only wonder to provide a building from a previous tech tier? > > presently the only way to mitigate the loss of building a granary is to focus on expansion and military before building the wonder. however for those who start with tradition, it can be an annoyance as granary is somewhat of a priority to support the specialists, especially when you have wheat/deer/bison/bananas nearby. > > it just takes a lot of time to research a tier 2 technology for a tier 1 building from a tech that isn't even a prerequisite! > > wouldn't it be better for it to provide a free barracks, at least for consistency with all the other wonders in that era that provide buildings from the same tech/tier? think of it as training soldiers in the hunt rather than storing meat from said hunts
