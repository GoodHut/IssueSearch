 URL : "https://github.com/sysgears/apollo-universal-starter-kit/issues/429" TITLE : update password mutation BODY : i noticed there is an updatepassword mutation that is unrestricted here: https://github.com/sysgears/apollo-universal-starter-kit/blob/master/src/server/modules/user/resolvers.js l123-l131 meaning anyone, logged in or not, can run this mutation and change anyone's password if they can guess the user id. i know this is just a boilerplate, but it feels like it would set people up better if we can restrict that to the current user context, or remove it so developers don't accidentally miss it. feel free to assign to me :
