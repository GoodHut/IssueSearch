 URL : "https://github.com/z0mt3c/hapi-swaggered-ui/issues/96" TITLE : enable configurable routes BODY : hi, when i have a non rfc-6265 compliant cookie like one with a space in the value but not wrapped in quotes then this /docs route will fail with the message { statuscode :400, error : bad request , message : invalid cookie value } hapi provides a way to prevent this, which is setting the route with config like such server.route { path: '/', method: 'get', config: { state: { parse: false } }, so, when this plugin registers its routes, it could first merge the config object with something supplied by the user, both solving this exact scenario and perhaps others.
