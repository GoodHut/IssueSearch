 URL : "https://github.com/rvolz/BicBucStriim/issues/246" TITLE : can't download epubs BODY : i can access bicbucstriim ok, can download pdfs, but cannot download epubs. chrome gives me the synology ip page isnâ€™t working synology ip is currently unable to handle this request. http error 500 ran installcheck and everything looked ok. 1 i recently upgraded to synology dsm 6.1, so this may relate to the problem. 2 web station now tells me that the http backend server is apache http server 2.2 and php is php 5.6 . when i first noticed the problem, it seemed that apache 2.2 had stopped running, but by stopping apache 4.4, i was able to get apache 2.2 to restart.
