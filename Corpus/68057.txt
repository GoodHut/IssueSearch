 URL : "https://github.com/coursier/coursier/issues/500" TITLE : regression in 1.0.0-rc1 BODY : updating from m15, and removing the coursierusesbtcredentials := true line in my build.sbt, results in many dependencies suddenly being unavailable resulting in compilation errors like syntax not a member of scalaz . sequence of events so far: update to rc1, remove the coursierusesbtcredentials line. everything works. change a dependency in my case, an update of scalaz from 7.2.8 to 7.2.10, along with a few other dependencies . result: compilation errors mostly related to the changed artifacts, but some are related to unchanged artifacts. i noticed 499, and tried the suggestion there -- brute force removal of the entire cache. this did not work. reverting to m15 solved the problem. returning to rc1 now works, even if i nuke the entire cache directory, although i left coursierusesbtcredentials in place. it is unclear if the issue is related to that or not. when it was in the bad state, 'sbt eclipse' also resulted in broken projects -- the project did not have scalaz-core as a dependency. however, coursierdependencytree shows scalaz-core. i'm reverting to m15 for now. a couple quirks in my config: all public repositories are routed through a corporate repo, maven central is removed, and credentials are required for most artifacts.
