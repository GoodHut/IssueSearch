 URL : "https://github.com/williamaeberhard/glmrob.nb/issues/1" TITLE : sd or se? BODY : according to the demo, this code returns standard errors, but according to the code and the column naming it seems to return standard deviations. in the meantime, i am assuming that the model returns standard deviations, and i am using boot and boot.ci for empirical standard errors and ci's. but they are slow, so if you are already including a less unwieldy method for computing the kind of standard errors you report in the paper, i would be happy for clarification. also, for your information, while getting the code to work, i kept running into this error: error in while abs max beta1 - beta0 > tol & it.mu < maxit { : missing value where true/false needed i ultimately got around it by explicitly setting the intercept of my input formula/model matrix as computed by model.matrix to zero y ~ 0 + x .
