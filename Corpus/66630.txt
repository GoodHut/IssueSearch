 URL : "https://github.com/awrichar/gradle-external-build/issues/1" TITLE : need more documentation BODY : a more complete example would help here. i'm still unable to figure out how this plugs into my broader build. apply plugin: 'com.cisco.external-build' model { components { mylib externalnativelibraryspec { buildconfig cmake { ... } buildoutput { ... } } } } apply plugin: 'java' dependencies { compile filetree dir: 'libs', include: ' .jar' } if i run gradle assemble, it does not attempt to build my jni library at all. any hints would be greatly appreciated! thanks!
