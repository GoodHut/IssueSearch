 URL : "https://github.com/cypherq/react-timesheet/issues/6" TITLE : add events callbacks proxy BODY : main component timesheet should spread events property over other components so it will be possible to pass additional event callback without explicitly listing them. we should allow only events for: - scale item ie. year 2012 from 2009 - 20016 years range - data bubble ie. 04.2014 - 12.2014 data bubble period callback should receive particular item and original event as arguments.
