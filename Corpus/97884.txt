 URL : "https://github.com/Darksonn/backblaze-b2-rs/issues/7" TITLE : i plan to use it in rdedup BODY : hi, this is a really nice crate! i was looking through the documentation, and it is really well done. i wish the higher-level api was available, but the raw one is actually exactly what i would expect. i have a couple of questions. is multi-threaded usage working well? i plan to employ a thread-pool, so just double checking. are you aware if keepalive is working? i'm looking at https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/6zm1uq/backblaze_reqwest_and_keepalive/ and for rdedup it is going to be very important to be able to efficiently upload many, many small files. having a working keep-alive could keep the link saturated, even with many very small files being uploaded. do you think there are any other things especially any current shortcomings that i should be aware of? anyway, thank you very much for this crate, it will make my task much easier!
