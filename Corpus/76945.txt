 URL : "https://github.com/cdmx/MiniMancera/issues/2" TITLE : memory leak on sktexture BODY : memory usage shows an increment every time a sktexture is loaded and it doesn't decrement after release. profiling with zombies, allocations and leaks proves this to be consistent. researching on forums it appears to be a constant among sktexture . need to research a bit more.
