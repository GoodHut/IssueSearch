 URL : "https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/issues/3377" TITLE : monitoring on orleans BODY : i would like to get stats in orleans , stats like cpu and memory usage, number of grains and any other telemetry data which can help me monitor the system and add/remove servers from my system. currently the old monitoring doc is almost incomplete or incorrect on every point or only talks about azure. https://dotnet.github.io/orleans/documentation/deployment-and-operations/monitoring/runtime-monitoring.html any pointers on how can i write the silo stats or detailed statistics metrics to my own db and also on how to get performance counters installed on the system? i know there are telemetry api but could not find any docs on them. we've had a disaster in our servers and i'm setting out to making sure it doesn't happen again. i want to monitor the system, add and remove servers when load goes up and down and ... if i receive some pointers i would be both glad and thankful and will help on updating the docs as before.
