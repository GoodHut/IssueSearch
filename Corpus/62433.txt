 URL : "https://github.com/CS2103JAN2017-T11-B3/main/issues/124" TITLE : code review - a0164212u BODY : @jay500s code review code quality is quite good. - documentations for non-trivial methods should include @param and @return tag with elaboration - run method in modelmanager has a very long conditional statement and could be abstracted into a boolean method - avoid use of 'magic' integers and strings - commented out code can be deleted. if needed, they can be retrieved from the repo - make more use of slap and avoid arrowhead style codes
