 URL : "https://github.com/reaper-oss/sws/issues/854" TITLE : jump to item peak rms/lufs BODY : there is a handy sws action to jump to item peak sample the loudest peak sample in the session but what would be more useful to me is a way to jump to peak lufs or at least rms sections of an item using an action/script. i would ask sws but they seem to be non-responsive. this goes along with request to normal items to a determined lufs or rms level. this would be a huge benefit to mastering folks as well as others. more comments here: http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=183151
