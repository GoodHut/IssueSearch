 URL : "https://github.com/mbland/go-script-bash/issues/82" TITLE : add @go.test_printf helper BODY : as it's often helpful to inspect the internal state of various variables while running bats tests, it'd be helpful to have a function like the following: bash @go.test_printf { if -n $test_debug ; then @go.printf $@ >&2 fi } then the command line may be prefixed with test_debug='true' , or inside individual test cases you can specify test_debug='true' run ... . theoretically @go.log debug may cover this, but i'm expecting usage of @go.test_printf to entail temporary injections that shouldn't get checked into the master branch of a project.
