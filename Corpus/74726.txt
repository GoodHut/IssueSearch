 URL : "https://github.com/nutofem/nuto/issues/84" TITLE : features into the readme BODY : i think it would be nice to have a short overview of what is nuto suited for, what is it being used for and what is possible. i'm not saying we need this to attract users, but i think it would be nice if the startpage was a bit more meaningful to collaborators etc. so, maybe we can add a short list, in an ideal world even linked to an example, of nutos features. from the top of my head: ---- physics ======= - mechanics - linear elasticity - viscoelasticity - von-mises plasticity - damage - phasefield damage model - gradient-enhanced damage model - heat conduction - moisture transport - mechanisms for easy coupling constraints =========== - dirichlet node boundary conditions - linear constraints between nodes using user-defined equations math ==== - block matrices/vectors with convenient per-independent-variable access parallelization =============== - finite element tearing and interconnecting - openmp interpolation and quadrature ============================ - most common quadrature schemes predefined: - gauss/lobatto - 1d/2d/3d - for simplexes and quadrilaterals/hexahedra - freely combine interpolation order and element shape - different interpolation order for each independent variable time integration ================ - newmark - runge-kutta 2, 3, 4, 3/8, cash-karp, dormand-prince - implex - velocityverlet - nystr√∂m - time dependent constraints & loads misc ==== - fibre embedding - vtk output - isogeometric analysis - mesh generator for simple meshes included - geometry generation for mesoscale concrete models ---- feel free to add or remove things. in particular, i'm unsure what to say about metamodel and optimize , because i haven't used them.
