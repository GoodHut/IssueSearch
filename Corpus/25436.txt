 URL : "https://github.com/jamiestraw/streaker/issues/2" TITLE : 🐧 linux support BODY : linux support should _in theory_ be supported already. i can't see anything in the docs https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/tray.md class-tray that would make me think there could be any issues. this will obviously need testing & if successful, the build and distribution commands should be modified to create the relevant linux files.
