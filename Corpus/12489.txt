 URL : "https://github.com/authzforce/server/issues/17" TITLE : policy editor ui BODY : hi, is it possible to perform operations on policies e.g. crud and domains with some webui apart from the rest interface ? in addition to that, can one graphically assign domains or policy sets to a particular set of users to manage their application related policies? please also note that i have a separate user identity management server in place, which can act as a saml idp and/or oauth2/oidc authorization server. so, if there exists a authzforce ui that understands any of the given protocols, the integration of authzforce and the idm can be realised. thanks, shiraz
