 URL : "https://github.com/fluture-js/Fluture/issues/81" TITLE : multi arity .node BODY : hi there, i would find it useful to be able to call node style callback functions with one or several arguments. for instance in the current example: future.node done => fs.readfile 'package.json', 'utf8', done is a future with no arguments, but it would be useful to be able to wrap fs.readfile into a future of one or two arguments. cheers, jun
