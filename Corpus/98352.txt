 URL : "https://github.com/cmdrmcdonald/EliteDangerousDataProvider/issues/112" TITLE : insurance variable not set BODY : i have been using the pre-flight check script included in eddi and have wondered why it very often gives me a warning about my insurance excess. i got rid of that message and decided to write my own insurance check routine and found that {dec:insurance} comes up as 'not set' in voiceattack.
