 URL : "https://github.com/KitsuneRal/gtad/issues/10" TITLE : support body in response BODY : as of https://github.com/kitsuneral/gtad/commit/f3d4f3b6252af0192d6f02adc7235ff64da9f7b6, gtad can parse object schemas, including those in the response. next steps are: - move the response structure from callclass to call in the model thereby accepting cases when the two calls having the same name might have different response types - but having two calls with the same name is forbidden by the swagger spec, anyway . - remove the code that checks the response for non-triviality and move the whole block that analyzes the result schema after a call object creation. - in printer , use the now useable response structure to fill in correct context values - in libqmatrixclient code, use the context values the current blocks of code refer to variables that don't exist in swagger's intermediate json .
