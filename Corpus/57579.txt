 URL : "https://github.com/dadadel/pyment/issues/51" TITLE : raise block convertion BODY : hi, i don't know if it is a problem but when the program finds exceptions without description it crashes. could be useful if the script warns the user about it or creates an empty string in that place because as it is the error is not explicative. the error is the following: >traceback most recent call last : > file /usr/local/bin/pyment , line 11, in <module> > load_entry_point 'pyment==0.3.2', 'console_scripts', 'pyment' > file build/bdist.macosx-10.12-x86_64/egg/pyment/pymentapp.py , line 150, in main > file build/bdist.macosx-10.12-x86_64/egg/pyment/pymentapp.py , line 99, in run > file build/bdist.macosx-10.12-x86_64/egg/pyment/pyment.py , line 344, in proceed > file build/bdist.macosx-10.12-x86_64/egg/pyment/docstring.py , line 1960, in generate_docs > file build/bdist.macosx-10.12-x86_64/egg/pyment/docstring.py , line 1937, in _set_raw > file build/bdist.macosx-10.12-x86_64/egg/pyment/docstring.py , line 1822, in _set_raw_raise >typeerror: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'nonetype' objects i'm using python 2.7.14 on macos with pyment v0.3.2 and i was converting from google doc style to rest . to reproduce the problem you can use the following code: python def foo : bar bar bar. raises: test pass as you can see if test has no description the program doesn't work, you have to specify something as follow. python def foo : bar bar bar. raises: test: bar pass
