 URL : "https://github.com/FidelLimited/serverless-plugin-optimize/issues/48" TITLE : new input: excludestage BODY : hello, i am wondering if it's possible to add a new input: excludestage. for invoke local for instance, we often don't need to optimize the function, or at least it should be optional. it will be good to exclude the optimization processing for some stages. what do you think?
