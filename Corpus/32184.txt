 URL : "https://github.com/Olivine-Labs/busted/issues/547" TITLE : typo in the website BODY : i don't know if this is the right place to report a typo on the website since it's not generated from source from here. anyway: to register a new output handler, the doc http://olivinelabs.com/busted/ output-handlers says to use the following line: lua local handler = require busted.outputhandler.base which should actually be: lua local handler = require busted.outputhandlers.base
