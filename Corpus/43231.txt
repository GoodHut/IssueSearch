 URL : "https://github.com/gtaylor44/SqlBulkTools/issues/33" TITLE : complex types support BODY : hello, i've spend a couple of days exploring sqlbulktools and i really enjoy it! thanks a lot for supporting the project. as far as i can see complextypes aren't being mapped automatically via addallcolumns and they cannot be added manually via addcolumn because sqlbulksetup uses completype's property name as id therefore, only 1 property of complex type can be mapped . are there any plans of getting complextypes working with sqlbulktools or am i doing anything wrong?
