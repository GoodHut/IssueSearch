 URL : "https://github.com/dotnet/dotnetfoundation-website/issues/12" TITLE : recent posts in footer BODY : copied from comment in 1 by @joeaudette > one thing in the layout i noticed a little section for recent posts in the footer. there is a view component in simplecontent we could use there to pull in the recent posts but would need to customize the view with some logic to extract the first image from each post to use for the thumbnail. actually i should probably do some work upstream in simplecontent to make it easier to extract the first image from posts there, already have that in the main blog viewmodel, just not in the one for the view component. > > as we go through this project if there are things you wish were different or could be improved to make things better in simplecontent let me know, i am certainly open to making upstream changes to improve things. > > i could take a stab at implementing the recent posts in layout, not sure if it should be a separate issue. i was going to try your blog importer and import posts from the current site but could not find a feed url in the html and not all recent posts have images in them. i guess we would need a default image to fallback to if no image is found in a post. is there an rss feed url for the current blog? if not i can just make some posts in my local copy to work with.
