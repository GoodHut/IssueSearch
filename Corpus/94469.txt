 URL : "https://github.com/eiannone/CBT-Diagnostic/issues/1" TITLE : cannot find the ble plugin BODY : hi eiannone, thanks for this great program. i have download it and run it using command as: cordova run android the application is build successfully, but there are some errors during run process: error: failed to fetch plugin https://github.com/randdusing/bluetoothle via registry. probably this is either a connection problem, or plugin spec is incorrect. i have not test it as i don't have a canbus triple device. but i am worry without correct plugin installation, the application will not work properly. this is a old project, could you please check this error and let me know any update was happening recently? kind regards!
