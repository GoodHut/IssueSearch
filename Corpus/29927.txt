 URL : "https://github.com/codemeta/codemeta.github.io/issues/6" TITLE : needs an about page BODY : the webpage makes very little mention of who is behind codemeta, which is an important element of sustainability. long term we want a page documenting both a governing board an governance, as well as a way to acknowledge contributors and supporters more explicitly at present we merely link a few supporting organizations on the home page . https://codemeta.github.io/workshop/ is some approximation of this as it of current status; though it is not linked from any menu.
