 URL : "https://github.com/goby-lang/goby/issues/134" TITLE : erb-like template engine BODY : since go's template engines all need to be compiled, it's not possible to create a template engine that to them. so the only way to have a template engine is to create one with goby . and i found a simplified implementation https://github.com/jeremyevans/erubi/blob/master/lib/erubi.rb of erubis , i think we can try to implement something like this. but we'll need satisfy to some prerequisites before doing this: - a cgi-like library - regex class - string gsub, scan, empty - ||= syntactic sugar cc @adlerhsieh
