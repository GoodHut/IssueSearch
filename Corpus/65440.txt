BODY : do you want to request a feature or report a bug ? feature what is the current behavior? currently there is no clean way to reload a server and the browser at the same time. if this is a feature request, what is motivation or use case for changing the behavior? ideally there would be a way to intercept reload events and tell the dev server when we are ready. something like this: js new devserver { prereload: done => { // restart a server, cleanup some files, do some stuff. settimeout done, 1000 // async tell dev server when to actually reload. } } please mention your webpack and operating system version. webpack 3.0, macos sierra.
