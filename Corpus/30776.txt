 URL : "https://github.com/tpq/peakRAM/issues/2" TITLE : ram used by c code? BODY : hey @tpq interesting package! it looks like you use gc to track memory usage, right? i like the portability of your approach i see from the cran check page https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_peakram.html that it works on all systems . but because you use gc that means that any code that calls c and allocates memory outside of the r garbage collector will not be counted, right? @analyticalmonk did something similar in https://github.com/analyticalmonk/rperform but we ended up using the ps command line program to measure memory https://github.com/analyticalmonk/rperform/blob/master/exec/rss.sh so we could count all memory that the r process is using even outside of the garbage collector . one issue with this approach is that it only works on systems with the ps program.
