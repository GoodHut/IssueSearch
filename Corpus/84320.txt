 URL : "https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth/issues/1418" TITLE : credential management api BODY : are there any plans to incorporate the new credential management api https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/credential-management/ with ember simple auth? i think it'd be great if this could be something that works out of the box for cross-device auto sign in. i'm not quite sure how it could be integrated for federated login though.
