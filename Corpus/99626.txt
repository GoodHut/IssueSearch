 URL : "https://github.com/GPUOpen-Tools/RGA/issues/8" TITLE : multiple sources per stage BODY : hi, our opengl engine uses multiple sources per shader stage. this allows us to have a modular system that can mix and match glsl with different version values. the rga tool is really nice, but we cannot supply multiple source files per stage. please allow more than one source to be specified per shader stage.
