 URL : "https://github.com/kaizhu256/node-nedb-lite/issues/1" TITLE : why no windows support? BODY : of what i could see, the only place you actually interact with the os is the mkdir -p in dbstorageinit . in the cost of very few characters - the windows equivalent can be supported - at least partially: if command extensions are enabled - which they are by default - then mkdir a/b/c/d on windows is equivalent to mkdir -p a/b/c/d - yup, -p is just not necessary also - if i get it right - there is a mode that does not persist to disk, and stays in-memory. if that's so - that makes just the persistence not supported on windows, and only in the case the os does not support creation of intermediate dirs very old versions of windows, or command extensions disabled . do i get it right? if i'm right - would you accept a pr to support windows under the terms mentioned above?
