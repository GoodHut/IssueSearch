BODY : anthony, i suspect there may be an upstream bug in svc.predict_proba . i believe it outputs the classifier probabilities in reverse order than what is stated in their documentation. i discovered this when setting my training period equal to my testing period. i would expect that you should get highly accurate buy and sells if you do this. however, 1. backtesting was producing the opposite recommendations. https://gist.github.com/uclatommy/27665486cb3778ba4636a012d6814783 . 2. so i tried updating the predict function to use model.predict_proba xs 0 consistent with my suspicions. https://gist.github.com/uclatommy/f186b5bfa20b3842b67a7ec35cf3ce2b/revisions 3. now i'm getting correct recommendations. https://gist.github.com/uclatommy/60f8f7c8e05062e51005c0cbac13c3c9 here's my data. https://gist.github.com/uclatommy/9360ac39dea9a4b15f5b5fbb32cee0d1 note: i do not have a lot of data so i'm breaking up the modeling frequency into 30 minute intervals.
