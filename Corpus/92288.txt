 URL : "https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/18510" TITLE : week.onoffset looks fishy BODY : a week offset with weekday=none behaves very much like a tick offset. the main difference is how they handle onoffset . assuming normalize is false, the week object will always return week.onoffset other --> false while the day object will always return day.onoffset other --> true . is this intentional?
