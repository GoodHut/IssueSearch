 URL : "https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons/Global_Screening_Arrays/issues/11" TITLE : generate penncnv pfb file BODY : write code using the script compile_pfb.pl , that comes with penncnv, to generate a pfb file. penncnv is installed on our nci cluster ccad/cgemsiii , so it's probably easiest to just run these tests there. on the cluster this is how you can see the help page for this script: module load penncnv/2015-v1.0.3 compile_pfb.pl -h please put working code for generating a pfb file in a .sh file in the scripts directory in this repo. i.e. test the code by submitting the bash script to the cluster using qsub. point us to the .sh file and close this ticket once you are confident that this code works. you'll need a number of penncnv input txt files for this. i'll start a separate ticket for generating these txt file for testing. scripts/gtc2penncnv.py can take gtc files and generate these txt files. i can point you to some gtc files on our nci cluster if it's easier to keep everything there instead of dealing with data transfer in multiple places. for testing you probably can just use a small number of txt files ~10-100 .
