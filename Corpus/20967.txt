 URL : "https://github.com/inorichi/tachiyomi/issues/799" TITLE : direct url import? BODY : possibly we could add direct url import for sources? a possible method of doing this: 1. loop through all sources checking if the link starts with a source's baseurl . 2. if it does, strip off the baseurl from the link. 3. create a new manga and set it's url to the new link. 4. check if a manga already exists in the library with this url and source. 5. call fetchmangadetails and fetchchapterlist to get the manga metadata/chapters. 6. ensure that at least the title field is filled out after doing this. if no exceptions were thrown, and a the title field is not blank/null, the link was successfully imported!
