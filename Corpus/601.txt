 URL : "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/11390" TITLE : i used tensorflow to build a deep learning training network and test network, and i was going to use the weights in the training network to use as the weight of the test network, where the training network and the test network were not the same, how should i solve? BODY : please go to stack overflow for help and support: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow if you open a github issue, here is our policy: 1. it must be a bug or a feature request. 2. the form below must be filled out. 3. it shouldn't be a tensorboard issue. those go here https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/issues . here's why we have that policy : tensorflow developers respond to issues. we want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. support only helps individuals. github also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. we want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to stack overflow. ------------------------ system information - have i written custom code as opposed to using a stock example script provided in tensorflow : - os platform and distribution e.g., linux ubuntu 16.04 : - tensorflow installed from source or binary : - tensorflow version use command below : - python version : - bazel version if compiling from source : - cuda/cudnn version : - gpu model and memory : - exact command to reproduce : you can collect some of this information using our environment capture script: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh you can obtain the tensorflow version with python -c import tensorflow as tf; print tf.git_version, tf.version describe the problem describe the problem clearly here. be sure to convey here why it's a bug in tensorflow or a feature request. source code / logs include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. if including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. large logs and files should be attached. try to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
