 URL : "https://github.com/devops-coop/ansible-minecraft/issues/11" TITLE : add backup functionality BODY : dan has implemented backups using a mixture of shell, cron, and rsync see minecraft-backup.j2 https://github.com/meatballhat/ansible-role-minecraft/blob/master/templates/minecraft-backup.j2 while matteo is using the built in fdb update utility for the modded servers see cron definition https://github.com/joshuacherry/ansible-role-minecraft/blob/master/tasks/main.yml l73 . both methods seem appropriate for their respective server type, so i think we should implement both. my first thought is to break these two processes into different plays backup-ftb.yml and backup-cron.yml and then run them based on a backup variable: example defaults/main.yml ... minecraft_server: minecraft minecraft_backups: cron ... example tasks/main.yml ... - name: configure {{ backup_method }} backup method include: backup-{{ backup_method }}.yml when backup_method is defined ... this seems like it would scale nicely as various server types are added. not sure if there are obvious issues i'm missing though.
