 URL : "https://github.com/noodlewerk/NWPusher/issues/40" TITLE : porting to swift 3.0 BODY : any intention to port it to swift 3.0 ? there are several issues related to the error management that would be easier to cope with if you poor the library. i have also another problem. unexpectedly, sometimes it refuses to work with the error invalid device token , but i'm sure it is valid, because it works with other testing tools. thanks
