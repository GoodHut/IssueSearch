 URL : "https://github.com/uudruid74/shellinabox_fork/issues/3" TITLE : add better mouse support BODY : xterm.js seems to support midnight commander in its default mode such that -g isn't required. at the moment, this isn't a huge issue since even gnome-terminal need the -g. however, mouse support in vim could be much better. for example, the mouse wheel isn't supported at all which would be very handy the current code doesn't really support mouse tracking.
