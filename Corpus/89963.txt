 URL : "https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/issues/2019" TITLE : resize dialog not opening BODY : when selecting an image, and the command resize & rotate, the dialog box no longer appears. the rest interface is quiet. it does not ask for a file , dim or any command at all. resize worked properly with this connector in earlier versions. the api 2.1 document states: > to be able to resize the image, cdc record file must be specified and resize dim. resize must be in true dim and contain a line with dimensions of height and width like 600x400 . if specified without resize dim resize the dialog will not work correctly. there is no reference to cdc record file in the documentation. it is unclear what this is. just guessing but it appears that earlier version of elfinder relied on the dim property of a file object. the object file provided includes a dim property with the accurate dimensions. guidance appreciated.
