 URL : "https://github.com/shin1x1/laravel-force-https-url-scheme/issues/6" TITLE : issue with symfony update BODY : after the update i started receiving an error in my requests only for production : the symfony\\component\\httpfoundation\\request::settrustedproxies method expects a bit field of request::header_ as second argument. defining it is required since version 3.3. see http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/http_foundation/trusting_proxies.html for more info. apparently one modification in a symfony method broke a method of the library, this method of symfony is: settrustedproxies which is used in this line: request::settrustedproxies $request->getclientip ; https://github.com/shin1x1/laravel-force-https-url-scheme/blob/master/src/forcehttpsurlscheme.php l38 in the new version of symfony it is required a second argument to the method settrustedproxies. i temporarily fixed it with: request::settrustedproxies $request->getclientip , request::header_x_forwarded_all ;
