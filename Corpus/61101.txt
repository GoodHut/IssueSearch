 URL : "https://github.com/getgrav/grav/issues/1455" TITLE : add-resource new plugin BODY : i would like to add my new plugin to the grav repository. here are the project details: admin addon media rename is a dead simple plugin which adds media rename functionality to the admin panel. i wanted to avoid renaming the files on my machine before uploading so i had this pieces of code on my website for a while. i thought it would be great to refactor it into a plugin. though it's more like a hack rather than a plugin :smile: as far as i know this kind of functionality will be added in the admin pro, so i don't mind if you reject this plugin. david-szabo97/grav-plugin-admin-addon-media-rename
