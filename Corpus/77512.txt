 URL : "https://github.com/bonfire-js/bonfire.js/issues/5" TITLE : new nodelocation syntax? BODY : i’m thinking of changing the syntax of nodelocation slightly: javascript //new syntax: let a = new _nodelocation ; a.adddepth “foo” .adddepth “bar” ; //old syntax: let a = new _nodelocation “foo”, “bar” which one do you find more intuitive? the new one completely abstracts away the whole locationarray stuff… if i make the change, it would still support both syntaxes!
