 URL : "https://github.com/google/mtail/issues/125" TITLE : tags for prometheus BODY : hi. there are mention in doc about tags but there are no examples of tags. so how do i add tags for prometheus about what am i collecting ? my scheme will be like this /var/log/noc/discovery- .log under is something about 12 files. that part of file have to be one of the tags that i've collecting in file there are several lines with interesting data one of them in /var/log/noc/discovery-nsk-00.log like 2017-11-26 19:18:45,694 scheduler.discovery my.sw discovery|periodic|switch-01 timings: uptime = 10033.82ms, interfacestatus = 10061.28ms, metrics = 20077.60ms so the final metrics from prometheus i am expecting is something like uptime_time{log= nsk , profile= my.sw } 10033.82
