BODY : first off thanks for a really useful library. i've already used it very successfully on a small project. however, now i've hit a problem with typing a date object. i'm probably missing something fundamental here. with the following: import { number, record, instanceof, static } from 'runtypes' const coords = record { latitude: number, longitude: number, time: instanceof date } type coords = static<typeof coords> let data: coords = { latitude: 1.0, longitude: 1.0, time: new date 2017, 0, 1, 10, 0, 0 } i get the type error: ... types of property 'time' are incompatible. type 'date' is not assignable to type 'dateconstructor'. what am i missing? if this is not the correct way to type a date object, what is?
