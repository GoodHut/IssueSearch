 URL : "https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX/issues/1028" TITLE : \ddot\imath is too wide BODY : \ddot\imath should render Ã¯ with the width of an i , not the width of the umlaut accent. i think the fix would be to render the accent with style width:0px , but then we need to fix the horizontal offset to be half the width of the accent character. so i believe this depends on 587 / 632 to add the width of characters specifically the accent characters to fontmetricsdata.js .
