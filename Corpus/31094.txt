 URL : "https://github.com/polybuildr/balloon-lang/issues/46" TITLE : roadmap after 0.1.0 BODY : working draft of the roadmap after 0.1.0 0.2.0 this release is meant to focus on the language features. thus, new language constructs that are dissimilar to existing ones and therefore require significant work to implement should happen in this release. tasks include: - figure out the typechecker story - investigate switching to a tried and tested algorithm 26 - figure out function types 45 - support union types 44 - figure out rest of the language probably excluding objects - sum types? at least some/none ? ok/err could come later - big big question around references. gc? - lists? as in the array kind. - iterators or at least looping through a sequence ? - map/dict? --- the proposed details of the below releases are rougher because they are farther away. :p 0.3.0 this release is meant to focus on the language's utility. add a basic standard library, improve performance to some extent. - bytecode - standard library - methods on native types, particularly strings, lists and maps - stdin/stdout/stderr i/o - file system i/o: crud on files and directories 0.4.0 0.5.0 this likely will be first proper, stable, usable, maybe useful release.
