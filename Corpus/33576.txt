 URL : "https://github.com/BibleBot/BibleBot/issues/5" TITLE : add update function. BODY : it'll do the following in this order : kill the running biblebot backup the databases clone/pull the latest version here run the new instance of biblebot i believe i will do this through a new start.js, with start.js being renamed to bot.js. maybe an sh script that the bot can run. the start.js will simply handle the processes of biblebot, in order that we don't fork a process off of biblebot itself, but rather a handler independent of it.
