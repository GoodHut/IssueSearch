BODY : i'm using this plugin for zooming images. i have a html div element and inside there are multiple images, normally 3-4. the problem i have happens when i zoom-in the first image at the top and then try to scroll to the bottom of the last image. i can't scroll to the bottom when zoomed in the scrolling stops on 1/4 of the last image . if i zoom-out then i can scroll to the bottom again. any idea why this is happening?
