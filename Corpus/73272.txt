 URL : "https://github.com/aubreyjcook/SeamlessResponsivePhotoGrid/issues/3" TITLE : correct repeating images BODY : the javascript code currently does not check if an image file number is already used in the string of html it adds to index.php. this results in repeating images in the grid. solution: this needs to be corrected giving the javascript some kind of logic to detect if it already added a certain file number. if it already has been added, it must select a different number from the available pool of random numbers.
