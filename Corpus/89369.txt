 URL : "https://github.com/Bailador/Bailador/issues/213" TITLE : proposal - bailador::jobs BODY : a back-end job queue for bailador. provide an api that can be used to submit long running jobs and let the already running bailador daemon or maybe a separate daemon? handle those jobs. the developer should be able to create jobs: job compute => sub { } we can provide some default jobs e.g. 'sendmail' that can be enabled/disabled/overridden by the user. the users, after appropriate authentication, would be able to submit task. a task would be the name of the job and a json string containing the parameters for the job. each job has a different json. a route would save the job in a database that has the following fields: owner : the username who submitted the job job name: e.g. sendmail or compute time of submission: payload: the json the user sent in the bailador daemon would monitor the job queue and execute the jobs in the order they were received in. the database can even be a directory of files, sqlite, etc. the results of the tasks if necessary will be saved in the database as well. there could also be persistent jobs. e.g. to allow someone to use it as a repl.
