 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS/issues/3130" TITLE : optional pep8 formatting BODY : i checked issue 1465, where @zooba said they do not prefer any particular style in vs. yet i was wondering why there is not an option to enable complete pep8 formatting. it's easier to work together with people using pycharm that way, and even vscode has the python plugins to format like this. in fact on of the plugins is using autopep8 https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8 . could this be considered for ptvs?
