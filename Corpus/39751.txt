 URL : "https://github.com/mozilla/thimble.mozilla.org/issues/1800" TITLE : start using prettier BODY : i'd like to see us start using prettier https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier with a precommit hook to auto restyle all our js. we have so many people working on the code, and lots of new contributors, for whom tabs vs. spaces, newlines, touching unrelated code, etc. is very difficult to get right. if our code formatted itself, and we all just used that style, i think we'd be in a much better place. my main reason for wanting this is to put an end to the don't use tabs here style comments in reviews, and beating down new contributors over silly styling.
