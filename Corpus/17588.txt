 URL : "https://github.com/stsp/dosemu2/issues/413" TITLE : put himem.sys in? BODY : just a topic for discussion. since we are at changing config.sys etc, i am also thinking about adding himem.sys by default. not that it helps a lot, but users do not even know this works. so putting it in by default has a good fate of hinting users that we support native himem.sys. : what do people think about that?
