 URL : "https://github.com/janeczku/go-dnsmasq/issues/26" TITLE : caching not working BODY : hello, i'm trying to use your docker for dns caching. but i cant figure out which settings to do, to get it work. i tested without any environment variables, and with dnsmasq_rcache. in both cases a dig gets always forwarded to the nameserver i set for the docker with dnsmasq_servers checked with a tcpdump can you explain the settings to just use caching functionality? thx for help. ps: the setting dnsmasq_default is not usefull for the docker, or it needs to be changed, cause it inserts a nameserver 0.0.0.0 to the resolv.conf of the docker.
