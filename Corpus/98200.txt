 URL : "https://github.com/Mobirise/Mobirise/issues/57" TITLE : in the accordion q&a block BODY : the first q&a block automatically opens.. this is a problem because you can only add 6 questions at a time. if i stack the blocks and remove the top and bottom padding thats fine but every 6th question is automatically expanded. i have the code editor but its a pain to modify and makes updating the blocks on each page timely. can you add an options toggle to enable/disable expanding the first block. thanks. <div class= toggle-default style= display: block; > <div class= panel-heading id= headingone > <span class= signspan pseudoplus ></span> <!-- change this to plus--> <h4 class= panel-title ><a role= button class= collapsed data-toggle= collapse data-core= href= collapseoneexttoggle1-41 aria-expanded= false aria-controls= collapseone >safety brief</a></h4> </div> <div id= collapseoneexttoggle1-41 class= panel-collapse noscroll collapse > <!-- remove in at the end of this -->
