 URL : "https://github.com/thomasp85/ggraph/issues/83" TITLE : support tripartite plots BODY : this is a fantastic package, i'm just starting to figure things out, so apologies in advance, if this is somehow ignorant. i'd really like to use a tripartite plot. we have data where 2 axes are sinks/source nodes only, and 1 axis is internal nodes only the one in the middle â€“ so it seems like a tripartite extension of a bipartite plot would fit well. . my graph terminology is not quite developed, so i'm attaching a bad sketch to show what i mean. ! fullsizeoutput_d65 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5372770/29998650-2583c050-9031-11e7-9810-313b0f8a9cce.jpeg so far we're shoehorning our network into a hive plot, but it looks a little odd, and the arguments do not seem to allow us to tweak it into a parallel-axes layout probably for good reasons . not sure how widespread this use case is, just thought i'd leave this here. such impressive work, thanks so much! cc @verenakasztantowicz
