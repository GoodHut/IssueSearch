 URL : "https://github.com/NBZ4live/ansible-php-fpm/issues/29" TITLE : bug with python 3 BODY : in file templates/pool.conf.j2, the line {% for directive, value in php_fpm_pool_defaults|default dict .items + item.items if directive != name %} is invalid: dict .items is not a list anymore, it's an iterator. maybe you should replace it by something like {% for directive, value in list php_fpm_pool_defaults|default dict .items + list item.items if directive != name %}
