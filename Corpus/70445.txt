 URL : "https://github.com/go-interpreter/wagon/issues/14" TITLE : wasm: create benchmarks BODY : we should have benchmarks. and we should have reference wasm module files. we could use a subset ? of the ones provided by wabt https://github.com/webassembly/wabt and/or by spec https://github.com/webassembly/spec . they both provide .wast files that we could check into our repo: we'd also need to check the corresponding .wasm files, created with wabt 's wast2wasm tool. all of this scaffolding .wast -> .wasm should be automated via a go generate rule.
