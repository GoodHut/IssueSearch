 URL : "https://github.com/G-TREE/DataSynthesisWorkshop/issues/9" TITLE : davos split plots BODY : @scelmendorf @atrant looking at and thinking about the davos data, i think the best plan is to remove all caged subplots and only analyze uncaged data. so, to link to the provenance issue, davos plots to subset and include will be uncaged herb.treat=non.ex and low provenances seed.provenance.um.zone=kublis and wiesen . the only remaining issue there is that the davos subplots are smaller than the standard gtree plot used at other sites, so they will need to be scaled to match the 50 x 50 cm size of the rest of the data. the davos subplots are 22.5 x 28 cm. yay? nay?
