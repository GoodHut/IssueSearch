 URL : "https://github.com/haxball/haxball-issues/issues/155" TITLE : room leaving issue BODY : hello. i don't know if it had been already suggested but nevertheless there is something to be fixed. a player should leave the room instantly not only when he presses the button leave but also when he just closes the browser or turns off the pc. it is especially important during official matches because in case of internet/power outage or browser failure the player is still in the field for 30 seconds and others at first glance might not notice him having problems, which can lead to losing match time and other misunderstandings. thank you
