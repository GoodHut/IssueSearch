 URL : "https://github.com/BlackToppStudios/Mezzanine/issues/160" TITLE : ecs - spawners BODY : we currently lack a system for defining basic parameters for the spawning of worldobjects/worldentities. parameters such as everything needed to create one, as well as where it will spawn fixed or in a predefined area, randomly or in a pattern , and common post-creation effects such as speed and direction of the spawned object. it is unclear whether the spawner will be implemented as a component or a worldobject/worldentity, but a worldobject/worldentity is more likely.
