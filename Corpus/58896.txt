BODY : hi, this looks like a great project to me, thanks! from documentation i haven't seen the ability to use shortcuts, i.e. esc for closing the preview image, arrows to navigate through the images both in normal mode as well as preview mode . i'm used to those shortcuts and i believe many end-users as well. it helps to speed up navigation a lot.
