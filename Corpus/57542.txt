 URL : "https://github.com/grimfang4/sdl-gpu/issues/101" TITLE : question about z order BODY : jonathan, i was wondering what should i do, if i want to control sprite z-index. in my setup, i'm using matrix transforms together with your gpu_blit method's to position and render my sprites. my matrices allow me to transform sprites hierarchically, and gpu_blit's transform parameters let me fine tune positioning - i.e. center sprites at local origin, flip it, or use rotated sprite sheets. works awesome. i'd love to be able to control sprite height , or draw order, or z coordinate in my matrix step. i tried changing z coordinate in my transform, but it didn't seem to work. is there anything i can do, turn on depth check, or write, or something to make it happen? thanks again for a great library.
