 URL : "https://github.com/timgit/pg-boss/issues/33" TITLE : boss archive name BODY : first of all, thanks for a nice lib : i've been wondering why job deletion is called archive ? as far as i can tell from sources, it simply delete s rows, and i think it is a bit of a stretch to call it archiving; from the docs, i was under impression it moves old stuff to a separate table, something like pgboss.job_archive .
