 URL : "https://github.com/City-of-Bloomington/master_address/issues/12" TITLE : group quarters flag BODY : the census has a category group quarters that applies to addresses where people stay/reside either temporarily or permanently. we want to be able to search on these and people who add and edit addresses need to be able to assign this flag. think it would be best to reference the location. we can't use location_use_type to define this as not all of these primary location use is residential such as hospitals, health rehab facilities, jails, etc. so we need to have either another table or another column to an existing table.
