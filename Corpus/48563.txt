 URL : "https://github.com/garyb/purescript-indexed-monad/issues/4" TITLE : sequencing of actions BODY : right now one has to use any of the following to sequence indexed monadic actions and discarding return values: purescript foo :>>= \_ -> bar foo mbind bar do foo; bar where bind = ibind if we had ixapply , we could implement : > , corresponding to > from apply. that would take us down the path of implementing the whole type class hierarchy bind, applicative, apply, functor, more? . we could perhaps also add :>> , like >> in haskell's prelude, and just have it defined for ixmonad .
