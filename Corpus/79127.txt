 URL : "https://github.com/Inovesa/Inovesa/issues/18" TITLE : rotationmap needs rework BODY : first of all, rotationmap needs a cleanup. there are remnants from early testing. for example, the option to choose rotationcoordinates or the rotmapsize are still exposed by the class but not by inovesa. secondly, off-center rotation should be implemented also for classic rotation. currently, it is only for manhattan rotation. off-center rotation is not compatible with flexible rotationcoordinates, so both problems belong together. - cleanup - off-center rotation
