 URL : "https://github.com/vimalloc/apfs-auto-snapshot/issues/2" TITLE : run as daemon BODY : if we run the tool as a cron, we have to deal with having all of the rules in a cronjob or launchd or whatever . this might make it harder to setup, could lead to some time machine -> database metadata race conditions, unnecessary snapshots being created, etc. i'm not entirely sure it would be better or not, but we should consider having this be a daemon that is running instead.
