 URL : "https://github.com/TechReborn/TechReborn/issues/1073" TITLE : iridium plate issue BODY : in gregtech there were two types of iridium plate : - one type that is ore dictionnaryfied and can be crafted in many different ways - one type which is not in the ore dictionnary and that is crafted with the iridium alloy ingot in the implosion compressor the problem is that we can make the iridium plates with other mods and we can skip using the implosion compressor so there's a balance issue. you should make like the old gregtech and implement two types of iridium plates.
