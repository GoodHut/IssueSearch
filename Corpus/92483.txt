 URL : "https://github.com/discolabs/cartjs/issues/126" TITLE : wrong image shown briefly BODY : hi cartjs team. i hope i am posting this in the correct repo. i am not 100% sure if this is a cartjs issue, a rivetsjs issues, or an implementation issue on my end. i have built a cart flyout that responds to the cart.requestcomplete . when the event is fired it opens to show the contents of the cart. when two items are added to cart at once, often times the same thumbnail image is shown for both items for a short period of time ~.5 - 5 seconds . then the correct image is shown. to see this in action, visit https://kammok.com/products/wallaby, select 'add python straps' and click add to cart. the issue happens most often on an empty cache. thanks in advance for your time on this.
