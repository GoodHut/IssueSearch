 URL : "https://github.com/go-graphite/carbonapi/issues/240" TITLE : migrate to grpc BODY : this is a pre-requirement for various pending improvements. examples of stuff we'll acheive: - better query multiplexing. grpc uses http/2 and because of that even when we have single requests, we won't have overhead for establishing/closing tcp connections. - better tracing support. this is pre-requirement for opentracing support - better context propagation - at this moment we need to marshal/unmarshal all interesting fields and send them as http headers, grpc can do that for us.
