 URL : "https://github.com/offirgolan/ember-cp-validations/issues/508" TITLE : revalidating a property BODY : the scenario... i have 2 fields the first field is a select with 3 options, null / no / yes the second field is a text field. i am showing the text field when the select field equals yes in the validate file i am adding a computed property to 'disabled' so the question doesn't validate when it is hidden. which works. however, the original validation persists when being hidden. the field does not get validated and why would it . so my question, is there a way to revalidate or reset a specific field's validation?
