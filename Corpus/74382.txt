 URL : "https://github.com/SonarOpenCommunity/sonar-cxx/issues/1026" TITLE : error in macro expansion BODY : hi, i get a parsing error when expanding this macro i'm using version 0.9.6 with sonarqube 5.6.4 : define define_operators t inline t &operator ^= t &a, t b { return t & int & a ^= int b ; } this macro definition is not the original one it is actually used to define several bit operators for enum types , it contains only the operator which seems to cause the problem operator^= , there is no error for example for operator&= .
