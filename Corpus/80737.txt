 URL : "https://github.com/coxthepilot/vitasa/issues/42" TITLE : update on /signups fails BODY : doing a put on /signups/{id} with approved = true and hours = 8 call succeeds without error but the values returned do not reflect the new values body as input: { approved : true , hours : 8 , user_id : 6 } response: { id :7, date : 2017-09-08 , created_at : 2017-09-04t22:46:58.000z , updated_at : 2017-09-04t22:46:58.000z , hours :0.0, approved :false, site : cody-library , user :6} when i later pull the user details that contains this work item, the values for approved are still false and hours = 0.0, so i'm assuming the write didn't stick. i note that the updated time is still the create time, ie no change.
