 URL : "https://github.com/Libresonic/libresonic/issues/252" TITLE : add plugin architecture BODY : one of the main reasons i started with libresonic was that i wanted more power over my music. libresonic offers much power out of the box, but there are many things that i would like to do that aren't currently possible. for example, i would like to customize how music is imported into my libresonic instance. perhaps invoke some custom external tagger, check for duplicate music already in the server, organize into appropriate folders, etc. the above was just an example, but one i think we'll find more and more often. the question is, should all functionality like this be built into libresonic, or should we provide a plugin-like architecture to allow users to customize components of libresonic to their liking? so with that, i would like to gather opinions on adding a plugin architecture to libresonic. both ui and backend. i understand this is a big undertaking and not something i could see working on in the near future. however i think it makes sense to see if this is something that we should do. some possible topics/discussion points are as follows: - pros/cons - design/architecture of building plugins into libresonic - distribution model - plugin ideas
