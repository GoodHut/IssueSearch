 URL : "https://github.com/vpusher/the-grid/issues/10" TITLE : infinitely resizing grid BODY : you've talked about this in the other thread. basically, we'd have an option whether the grid should be expanding automatically or not. if it should, the grid will respond dynamically in size when adding, moving or resizing children. if not, the behavior right now is kept. pull request coming soon...
