 URL : "https://github.com/vmware/photon/issues/719" TITLE : static routes not working BODY : i have a problem with both static routes and adding routes through dhcp. im using the default 99-dhcp-en.network rule in /etc/systemd/network i added following config to the same file to get routs from windows server dhcp 121 classic static route dhcp useroutes=true this did not work. i added following to the same file. route gateway=10.10.10.1 destination=20.20.20.0/24 when i updated config i ran systemctl restart systemd-networkd to reload it. this did not add the routes to the list shown by ip route show command. reboot does not add routes either. only way i can update a route is through the command ip route add 20.20.20.0/24 via 10.10.10.1 that is not persistant though. any suggestions?
