 URL : "https://github.com/OpenAgInitiative/openag_ui/issues/124" TITLE : failing to start a recipe BODY : @aguadopd reported that recipes can't be started via the ui on the forum http://forum.openag.media.mit.edu/t/food-computer-was-unable-to-start-recipe/1111 apparently the ui is sending the following json payload when starting a recipe via this bit of code https://github.com/openaginitiative/openag_ui/blob/1ca22dfe423a085cbbac55fd5ab0b35c216f36b9/scripts/app.js l342 : { recipe_id : test_recipe } however, it looks like the api expects the json payload to be an array of arguments https://github.com/openaginitiative/openag_brain/blob/master/src/openag_brain/software_modules/api.py l136-l143 that will be passed to the service, such as this: test_recipe here is a curl example request that should work with the current api. curl -xpost 'http://10.0.0.8:5984/_openag/api/0.0.1/service/environment_1/start_recipe' \ -h content-type: application/json \ -d ' test_recipe ' i am not that familiar with this codebase, but i'll try to submit a pr for this soon.
