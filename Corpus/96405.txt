 URL : "https://github.com/rstacruz/dom101/issues/123" TITLE : es imports from index file BODY : as i read, it is not recommended to use the index file. i assume it makes sense as unnecessary code would be bundled. though for me it makes sense to use following syntax import { addclass, removeclass, on } from 'dom101'; that would work perfectly with webpack and the uglifyplugin, as it should only bundle those used and eliminate dead code. but currently this does not work as expected. webpack does not recognize unused methods in dom101 as dead code. do you have any idea - why webpack does not recognize unused dom101 methods as dead code - how we could improve dom101 to support this feature thanks in advance
