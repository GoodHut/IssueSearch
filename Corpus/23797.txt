 URL : "https://github.com/SciTools/iris/issues/2470" TITLE : remove config file BODY : everything useful in the site.cfg seems now to be a path. some of those iris-test-data are now primarily managed through the import chain anyway, with temporary override provided via an environment variable. the sole current exception seems to be palette_path but, being a path, it could presumably be managed in the same way. i think the existing point of iris.config is to manage settings depending on the external system, which we don't want hard-wired into the code iris or user . however, if all those settings are actually going to be just paths, then we actually don't need a file for that and we can get rid of it.
