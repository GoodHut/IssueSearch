 URL : "https://github.com/rstudio/keras/issues/36" TITLE : clear_session missing? BODY : hello, i train a lot of models and run in the same problem as is described in https://github.com/fchollet/keras/issues/3579 i.e. my tensorflow is getting cluttered and the newer models need more time. the solution in python would be to use from keras import backend as k k.clear_session i can't seem to find a corresponding function within https://rstudio.github.io/keras/reference/index.html is there a more elegant solution to this problem as loading/restarting several r-sessions? greetings and thank you, martin
