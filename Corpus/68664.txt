 URL : "https://github.com/substance/texture/issues/223" TITLE : separating model and ui BODY : @oliver---- @michael can i just confirm my understanding that texture will provide both the texturejats model and a ui? if my understanding is correct, is it possible to separate these out? my use-case is that the model will be used in cli node tools for normalising and validating jats documents, while the ui will be used in electron apps. if you prefer to keep them in a single module that is of course your prerogative, but i wanted to raise a use-case where keeping the conversion/modelling distinct from any rendering has benefits.
