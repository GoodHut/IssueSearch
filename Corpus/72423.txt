 URL : "https://github.com/ebi-pf-team/interproscan/issues/21" TITLE : build custom iprmatch db BODY : is it possible to build a custom interpro match database for local service to provide annotations already run but not in the ipr master database . i have the generated xml locally for new proteomes not in uniprot but need to re-search these after improvements to the genome annotation and gene models and would prefer to not have the expense of re-running all.
