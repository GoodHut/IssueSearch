 URL : "https://github.com/oliver-moran/jimp/issues/229" TITLE : make jimp non-blocking BODY : any change jimp could be updated so it's non-blocking? using jimp i created a program to change the quality on a large set of images and the whole time the process was running it blocked the event loop preventing other things from running. also, the memory consumption on the node process skyrocketed to over 500mb. a quick review of your code shows me that everything is processed in memory by use of buffers and i don't mean buffered streams either . image files are large and would be better processed in streams https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html . this would prevent the event loop from getting blocked and keep memory consumption down.
