 URL : "https://github.com/Masterminds/glide/issues/773" TITLE : repo option ignored BODY : there is a project where i need to use a different git repository for one dependency. that's where repo option under a package comes in, right? unfortunately, glide completely ignores this. tried using latest git master glide version tried clearing ~/.glide later i found that the repo option is probably not parsed. example glide.yaml : yaml package: github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db import: - package: github.com/eris-ltd/eris-logger repo: https://quiark@bitbucket.org/aslab/eris-logger.git
