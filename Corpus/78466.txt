 URL : "https://github.com/palantir/blueprint/issues/1657" TITLE : proposing blueprint lite BODY : hello, the blueprint ui is very polished but maybe the react / typescript features put it beyond use for some legacy development html/css/js pipeline. would love a 'lite' ui framework simlar to bootstrap or mdl mdl https://getmdl.io/ that essentially is more traditional code for use with traditional skills and pipelines, if possible. thanks!
