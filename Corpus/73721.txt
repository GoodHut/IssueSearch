 URL : "https://github.com/WordPoints/wordpoints/issues/615" TITLE : decimal number data type BODY : as far as numbers go, we currently only have the integer data type. but we've always intended to introduce a data type for floats, and we've come across a use for one in https://github.com/wordpoints/woocommerce/issues/23 issuecomment-277084351. i suppose that we should call it decimal_number . we'll have to consider how to work out comparisons, since 5.00 is the same as 5 in this case, i guess. added restrictions that required a certain number of decimals, etc., should probably be sub-types, if needed.
