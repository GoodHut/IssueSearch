 URL : "https://github.com/querydsl/querydsl/issues/2170" TITLE : is querydsl dead? BODY : hi, i cannot fail to notice that the project has 249 outstanding issues, 32 pr-s, no merges since february, etc. is the project dead? i think there are more than a few people willing to help resolve issues, but at this pace of merging it hardly motivates people to use querydsl at all. not sure how other people do this, but for me if a project has outstanding issues but no commits since months, that's a red flag, and i won't be using that tool. please either resolve the issues without fixes, or onboard someone to help out. keeping the project in this seemingly dead state won't help and it would be a shame if people don't use this awesome tool just because it looks like it's abandoned.
