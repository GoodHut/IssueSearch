 URL : "https://github.com/IcecrownServer/Icecrown/issues/62" TITLE : npc/quest lazy peons BODY : bug: most of the lazy peons in the orc/troll starting area are just standing there idle what should happen: lazy peons should periodically chopping at trees and dropping off the lumber at wood piles that are near the trees. every so often some of them should 'take a nap' in doing so this allows players to complete the quest 'lazy peons' how to reproduce: this is nothing a player can reproduce, just bring a character to orc/troll starting zone and watch all the lazy peons scattered about. source: http://wotlk.openwow.com/quest=5441
