BODY : hi @mariomc i am wondering if your project is still active? i wanted to develop an open-source software with the npmjs registry name mink . if you're not planning to push development under the name mink , would you consider releasing the name to me on npm? i know this is a big ask, but i figured i would try anyway . thanks for considering. feel free to contact me al@pwn.io.
