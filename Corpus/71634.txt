 URL : "https://github.com/LMFDB/lmfdb/issues/2323" TITLE : add supersingular primes BODY : seems like this would be easy to add in genus 1 and useful to see, up to a reasonable bound. the bound may be just the number of a_pp's that are stored in the l-function? in genus 2, maybe we just list the superspecial or supersingular primes; i suppose the case p-rank 1 is also interesting?
