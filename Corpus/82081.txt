 URL : "https://github.com/atata-framework/atata/issues/39" TITLE : add drag and drop support BODY : selenium provides a mechanism for allowing actions to be performed such as drag and drop with certain key presses. this allows for the automation of actions such as shift drag and drop or ctrl drag and drop. it would be nice to be able to drag an element to another element and drop it. perhaps also allow for a way to say whereabouts on the second object you would like to drop the item? always find drag and drop a very annoying feature to implement using selenium and having 'atata' do it nicely would be a huge benefit!
