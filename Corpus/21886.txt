 URL : "https://github.com/albfan/nerdtree-file-filter-plugin/issues/3" TITLE : hide empty folders BODY : awesome plugin! how difficult would it be to hide folders which are empty once the filter is applied? if you don't have time to look at/address this, do you have an idea of what to look at? i'm not very familiar with vimscript but would be prepared to get my hands dirty to get it working. i had a quick glance at it/attempt, but am not sure how to check if a folder is empty recursively. perhaps it would make sense as an extra filter to apply as a separate plugin?
