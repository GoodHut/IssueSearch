 URL : "https://github.com/rstats-db/RMariaDB/issues/64" TITLE : legacy mode available? BODY : rmariadb is meant to be a drop-in replacement for rmysql, however it handles datatypes very differently. for example, bigints are now imported as integer64 instead of numeric, and sql date columns are imported as date instead of character. all of these are improvements, however as it is supposed to be drop-in replacement , is there a legacy mode so that i can use this instead of rmysql without rewriting all the scripts that depend on data read from it?
