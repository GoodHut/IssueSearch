 URL : "https://github.com/laravel/horizon/issues/178" TITLE : horizon orphan process BODY : i'm running horizon on a latest forge machine as documented... the daemon with php artisan horizon and on deployments php artisan horizon:terminate but time to time i need to manually run php artisan horizon:purge . this is the output i just got after after hours of last release: $ php artisan horizon:purge observed orphan: 17043 observed orphan: 30634 observed orphan: 31084 observed orphan: 31085 i can confirm it's orphans by running htop on tree mode press f5 and i see these process as root process, not inside the master php artisan horizon process. ------- and also, every time i run purge, it always wrongly see 1 process as orphan: $ php artisan horizon:purge observed orphan: 17059 i haven't found a pattern yet why this is happening.
