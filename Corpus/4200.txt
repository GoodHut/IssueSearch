 URL : "https://github.com/parkmath/parkmath/issues/45" TITLE : answers => pdf BODY : answer documents are now checked in, in markdown format. last step is to include them in the jekyll/prose process to generate pdfs for them. note: i'm actually considering leaving these _out_ of the jekyll process and having a more manual pdf generation process, because a it'll be easier/quicker, and b it'll prevent answer doc generation from slowing down the lesson publishing pipeline
