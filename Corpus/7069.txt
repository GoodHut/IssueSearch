 URL : "https://github.com/gimli-rs/gimli/issues/176" TITLE : cut new release BODY : it'd be great if we could cut a new gimli version soon. addr2line https://github.com/gimli-rs/addr2line needs 164 and 165 in order to compile, so it's currently required to use gimli as a git dependency. once a new release is cut, it can move both gimli and owning-ref following the release of 0.2.4 https://github.com/kimundi/owning-ref-rs/commit/c00676ea361eae657cfda05bf14fbca3390d0a23 to regular, versioned dependencies, which will allow us to start pushing to crates.io again. /cc @philipc @fitzgen
