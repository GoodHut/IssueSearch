 URL : "https://github.com/40Digits/code-standards/issues/7" TITLE : php closing tags BODY : i feel like we need to discuss this again sometime: http://php.net/manual/en/language.basic-syntax.phptags.php > if a file is pure php code, it is preferable to omit the php closing tag at the end of the file. this prevents accidental whitespace or new lines being added after the php closing tag, which may cause unwanted effects because php will start output buffering when there is no intention from the programmer to send any output at that point in the script. from the psr-2 page: > 2.2. files - all php files must use the unix lf linefeed line ending. all php files must end with a single blank line. the closing ?> tag must be omitted from files containing only php. these seem to be in conflict and/or we don't really do 100% either direction. while we often mix html/php, the ending declaration is most likely php, yet our files have a lot of newlines, closing tags, or mixture of both. can we standardize this a bit for security's sake?
