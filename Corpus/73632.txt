 URL : "https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-snappy/issues/243" TITLE : custom toc blank - path? BODY : hi, i am trying to create a custom toc xsl file but the toc ends up being blank. i am using ->setoption 'toc' , true ->setoption 'xsl-style-sheet','custom_toc.xsl' the toc in itself works fine. i had problems dumping the default xsl file myself. the binary said command not found if i navigated to the vendor/../bin folder and ran: wkhtmltopdf-amd64 --version or any other option. so i have copied the default toc from: https://github.com/jsreport/jsreport-wkhtmltopdf/blob/master/lib/default-toc.xsl wkhtmltopdf doesnt seem to load the file. i have placed it in the bin folder. maybe the path needs to be different? weirdly wkhtmltopdf does not throw an error if there is no xsl file present. thanks in advance!
