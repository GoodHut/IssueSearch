 URL : "https://github.com/nolanlawson/ember-pouch/issues/179" TITLE : one database per model? BODY : hi, we are looking into using couchdb for an application of ours. we are caching millions of records from an rdbms database with some backgrounds jobs. because it's different kinds of data customers, addresses, work orders etc that has its source in different rdbms tables, we were thinking of using different databases for each type of data. like this: app_customers app_customer_addresses app_work_orders ... we will then sync & filter this data into a form suitable for using with couchdb in offline mode, with pouchdb. but we also want certain parts of the application usable in online-only scenarios, going straight towards these databases or, that was the plan . however, i am not seeing any obvious way to use multiple databases with ember-pouch . this issue discussed it, but no solution is suggested: https://github.com/nolanlawson/ember-pouch/issues/33 possible workarounds i can think of: - using ds.store adapterfor http://emberjs.com/api/data/classes/ds.store.html method_adapterfor in ember. creating one adapter for each model type. however, our app is using perhaps 10-20 different models so it is a bit cumbersome. - skip the idea of segregating the data, and live with the fact that we will put perhaps 5 million different records of 10-20 different kinds into a single couchdb database. any better ideas?
