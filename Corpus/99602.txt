 URL : "https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/issues/802" TITLE : multi architecture support BODY : it would be great if mastodon could run on systems other than intel, such as raspberry pi, armv8, etc. this would get it into the hands of people with home single-board computers running their own services, plus some new data center arm servers. the fastest path that i can think of to doing this is to build the system with an alternative docker-compose.yml file, and have it pick up the containers appropriate to each of those other systems e.g. armhf, aarch64 . some dependencies to track: raspberry pi ruby: https://hub.docker.com/r/armhf/ruby/ redis: https://hub.docker.com/r/armhf/redis/ postgres: https://hub.docker.com/r/armhf/postgres/ armv8 ruby https://hub.docker.com/r/aarch64/ruby/ redis: https://hub.docker.com/r/aarch64/redis/ postgres: https://hub.docker.com/r/aarch64/postgres/
