 URL : "https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch/issues/86" TITLE : search state parameter BODY : question i have a react+redux application where i reproduce search state from a query url. it seems passing this search state to the instantsearch component is not sufficient enough to reproduce the search. do i need to use virtual widgets to reproduce the refinements? if so this seems a bit clunky as i'll have to have many virtual widgets each reproducing refinements. also if this is the case you may want to update the documentation on search state https://community.algolia.com/react-instantsearch/guide/search_state.html to explicitly state widgets/virtual widgets must be present for the refinements.
