BODY : hi ! i just found the file sass/layout/_ups.scss , where contains the 'ups' settings. i understand the usage of the 'ups', but i'm not native english speaker, would you tell me what does the 'up s ' means..? by the way, class name like .children-are-divided-into-four is more understandable for me lol.
