 URL : "https://github.com/FindVoices/FindVoices/issues/4" TITLE : add history tracking BODY : we only want to show new tweets the user hasn't already accepted / rejected. in searches/utils add a max_age timestamp, and change searches to only show tweets newer than that. in the web interface, save the age of the newest tweet you show, so next time you can start there. make sure something sensible happens on page refreshes or changed searches. doesn't have to be perfect, just make sure it isn't baffling. :
