 URL : "https://github.com/inasafe/inasafe/issues/3723" TITLE : update test in inasaef BODY : problem currently, we have ok skipped=15, expected failures=28 on travis. can you check each of them, and see if you can make a useful unit test from them? it will be great if we have better unit test and coverage. it will be good for @myarjunar to understand the code base faster while waiting for the next urgent issue to be fixed. personal request: can you check unit test under test_function_centric_wizard and fix them? expected behaviour we have better test.
