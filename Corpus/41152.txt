 URL : "https://github.com/danielquinn/paperless/issues/249" TITLE : wrong time/ timezone BODY : the web-ui shows me note: you are 2 hours ahead of server time. when editing reminders. indeed, it also saves in utc rather than my timezone which may be ok but it should show me my local time. i tried to add /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro and /etc/timezone:/etc/timezone:ro as volumes and adding tz=europe/berlin to docker-compose.env but it still shows not my local time.
