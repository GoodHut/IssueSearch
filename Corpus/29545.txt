 URL : "https://github.com/lettre/lettre/issues/148" TITLE : make mailbox public BODY : i have some code that sometimes i have an email address along with the real name: bill gates with bill@microsoft.com . and sometimes i have just the email address. i need to construct a list of addresses to send an email to, since the types for my data are heterogeneous, i need to merge them into a list of addresses in a homogeneous type, and the natural type is lettre's mailbox type. i can't do this because mailbox is never exported.
