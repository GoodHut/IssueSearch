 URL : "https://github.com/Neamar/KISS/issues/693" TITLE : web search suggestions BODY : i think would be useful to have search suggestions from the search engines. but i think that this could choke the other results if displayed immediately. maybe it should be displayed when remain only the search on google/wiki... result. or maybe it should be displayed, for example, only when the input is longer than 5 letters.
