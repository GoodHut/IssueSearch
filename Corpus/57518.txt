 URL : "https://github.com/arangodb/arangodb/issues/2405" TITLE : query processing stall BODY : my environment running arangodb i'm using the latest arangodb of the respective release series: - x 3.1.16 on this operating system: - x linux - x debian .deb i kill two out of 3 db servers everything is still well. i start the 2 i just killed and kill the last one. all query and subsequent progression will stall and eventually time out. i can consistently reproduce this by doing what i said before. one example stalled query executed after the last death : 103275	for x in @@collection let att = append slice attributes x , 0, 25 , _key , true limit @offset, @count return keep x, att 34.93 s	2017-03-29t16:02:40z and it stays this way until the query times out somewhere around 112 - 120s? the cluster can only recover after starting that one downed node. subsequent queries would continue to fail until the last killed dbserver was started again. the expected situation would be for subsequent queries to have gone to the 2 recently started dbservers.
