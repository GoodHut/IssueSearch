 URL : "https://github.com/facn2/ApolloXII/issues/46" TITLE : search function non pure? BODY : really nice modularisation of all your code, but you're search function relies on the food variable to work, so testing it you would also have to require in food - maybe pass it as a second variable to the function jsontosearchthrough and then you've got a nice neat, easily testable function.
