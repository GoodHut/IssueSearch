 URL : "https://github.com/kpwn/yalu102/issues/364" TITLE : ssh doesn't work BODY : iphone se ios 10.2 well ssh never worked for me. i tried running dropber -r -f -p 22 but it doesn't work. all dropbear files are in place and it says it's running. but it doesn't even open port 22. it didn't work since the beginning. ssh tunnel doesn't work. it says: server unexpectedly closed connection. i'm connecting with putty on windows. note: from my understanding this is a code issue as it didn't work since the beginning and is implemented by yalu itself.
