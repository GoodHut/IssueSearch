 URL : "https://github.com/jd/tenacity/issues/76" TITLE : reset stop conditions BODY : assume we have next function: python3 @retry stop=stop_after_attempt 3 def test_function : while loop that does jobs every successful iteration is a completed job while not stop_event.is_set : some code that can raise exception here we have counter that will decrease on every failed job. but due to while loop it becomes a counter of failed jobs instead of attempt counter. although i could separate the job completion code into another function, there's another problem: every next job need data from some previous jobs. so i will need to use outer data, what is slightly non-pythonic, i believe. proposal is to add functions to reset stop conditions all and/or specific .
