 URL : "https://github.com/SpoonX/sails-hook-authorization/issues/27" TITLE : broke in upcoming sails v1 BODY : sails v1 appears to have refactored the way modules get loaded thus the override to support multiples source paths for controller doesn't work anymore. this https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/blob/master/lib/app/private/controller/load-action-modules.js is the piece of code that now control actions loading. does anyone has an idea for a fix ?
