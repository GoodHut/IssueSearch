 URL : "https://github.com/dependencies-io/actor-ruby-bundler/issues/1" TITLE : optional bundler version? BODY : the bundler version is a field in the gemfile.lock, so if the user was not using 1.15.3, then there will be a line change for that as well not to mention potential install-process differences . is that an issue? will people want to specify the bundler version that they are using? could add setting_bundler_version , and in an entrypoint check if it is not the latest, and downgrade if need be.
