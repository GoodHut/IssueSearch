 URL : "https://github.com/randoop/randoop/issues/209" TITLE : gradle targets for testing BODY : what is the difference between ./gradlew test systemtest and ./gradlew check ? should the gradle test target be renamed unittest for clarity? the developer manual gives a rather complex command that achieves more thorough checking; why not have a more simply-named target for this, which travis could also use? how is it different than the build target, and should the build target also do all that checking? it could be cleaner to eliminate the validatemanual target or make it an internal, unadvertised target and have that done every time that ./gradlew manual is run. is run-time cost the reason that this is not done currently?
