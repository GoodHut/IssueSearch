 URL : "https://github.com/phaibin/DragDropDemo/issues/8" TITLE : translation to swift BODY : dear leon, it would be great if you could provide a swift version of your dragdropdemo. i tried, but wasnâ€™t able to translate your code by myself. without any experience in objective-c the code is hard to read. i also believe that not every method is 1-on-1 translatable since some methods seems to have different parameters i.e. draggingsession in swift has no sourceoperationmaskfordraggingcontext . thanks in advance and best regards, martin
