 URL : "https://github.com/jMetal/jMetal/issues/235" TITLE : update sonar in maven BODY : just a suggestion: the sonar-maven-plugin in the pom is on version 2.2, but it has passed 3.3 already. i would suggest to update it. by the way, i checked my fork of jmetal with it i had to update the version to make it works, thus the suggestion , and here are the results: https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=org.uma.jmetal%3ajmetal i like it a lot. the 13.2% coverage is particularly alarming, by the way. if you know some people who want to participate but don't know where to start from, you may suggest them to look at this analysis to peek what they want from it and resolve it. {^_^}
