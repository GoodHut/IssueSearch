 URL : "https://github.com/simpeg/simpeg/issues/579" TITLE : saving of simpeg objects BODY : currently, there is very limited support for saving simpeg objects. most are pickle-ble but that isn't a great format for long time storage due to compatibility issues that may arise. it would be helpful to tie this into some exciting protocols and/or standards, select common file format/formats hdf5, json, xml, ... and include meaningful metadata. it would be appreciated to get comments and discussion on this.
