 URL : "https://github.com/ankush-me/SynthText/issues/75" TITLE : generate text on a plain BODY : in the paper 'towards end-to-end text spotting with convolutional recurrent neural networks' https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.03985.pdf the authors use this engine to generate synthetic text on pure colour backgrounds. the problem when using a pure color background is that the depth is the same everywhere, and therefor the nregions is zero https://github.com/ankush-me/synthtext/blob/master/synthgen.py l619 . any suggestion on how to generate region proposals on a plain background? thanks! maurits
