 URL : "https://github.com/donmelton/video_transcoding/issues/133" TITLE : making audio louder BODY : is there a way to make the audio in the transcoded video, louder? if so, what are the options to do so? i ask because when i watch the transcoded video on my roku through my tv, i have to double the volume on the tv. i usually watch everything with the volume set at 16, and when i watch the transcoded videos i have to turn the volume up to about 32, so i was wondering how to increase the volume of the video itself? thanks in advance!
