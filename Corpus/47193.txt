 URL : "https://github.com/c4ev3/EV3-API/issues/5" TITLE : nxt ultrasonic sensor BODY : hi, i'm trying to use a nxt ultrasonic sensor on the ev3 using c4ev3. from what i understand, this is an iic sensor, therefore, i was not suprised for it not to work always reading 0 as a us_dist_cm sensor, which seems to be uart. while going through c4ev3 source code, it seems the iic is not fully implemented commented //ioctl g_iicfile, iic_set_conn, &devcon ; in ev3sensor.c . i just need to read the distance in cm from nxt ultrasonic sensor, so i'm trying to implement by hand the required function, but when trying to read it using readiicsensor in_4 , seems i always get the value 66 in the address returned by the function. some help would be very welcome here. manu
