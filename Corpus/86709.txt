 URL : "https://github.com/grm34/archboot/issues/4" TITLE : implement locale choosing BODY : hello grm34, i really like this script as it allows me to automatically arch on some machines. the only downside is that the locale defaults to french which is bad for me since im from germany - and i've never seen the french keyboard layout before - so, do you have plans to do something like this?
