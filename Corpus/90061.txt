 URL : "https://github.com/krispo/angular-nvd3/issues/727" TITLE : rightalign in multi chart BODY : not sure if this is more of a feature request or bug report. but checking the examples here http://krispo.github.io/angular-nvd3/ /multichart , i noticed using rightalign: false works well for pie charts and most others, but on multi chart it instead just aligns the legend somewhere in the middle instead of on the left in the linked example as well . is there a work-around or possible fix to have the legend aligned on the left for multi charts?
