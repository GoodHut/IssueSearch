 URL : "https://github.com/cereda/arara/issues/87" TITLE : updates to indent.yaml BODY : hello arara team! thanks for all of your work on the awesome arara tool : i'm nearly ready to release version 3.0 of latexindent.pl , and wondered if a few updates to indent.yaml could be made https://github.com/cereda/arara/blob/master/rules/indent.yaml . updates to existing switches - i've made a small change to the -o flag so that it works in a more logical way, and the output file is tied to the -o switch; for example, the following syntax is now appropriate: latexindent.pl myfile.tex -o=myoutputfile.tex the -l switch can now take an optional argument; for example, the following are both allowed: latexindent.pl myfile.tex -l latexindent.pl myfile.tex -l=myymal.yaml new switches - there's a few new switches to be added to the rule, if that's ok: - -m switch for modifylinebreaks this switch doesn't take any arguments, it's just on/off - -g=name.log for the name of the logfile; this switch needs an argument does indent.yaml now ship with arara in texlive and miktex ? i hope that these updates sound ok; do let me know if i can do anything to help. thanks again chris
