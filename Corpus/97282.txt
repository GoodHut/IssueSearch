 URL : "https://github.com/marcbachmann/node-html-pdf/issues/247" TITLE : generate a pdf using vuejs BODY : first of all this is not an issue and i don't know where to ask questions. in the documentation, the simplest way to do this is: var html = fs.readfilesync './test/somefile.html', 'utf8' ; var options = { format: 'letter' }; but what if i want it to have a data coming from my database? i am using vuejs and planning on passing some data to it. is it possible? any suggestion would be much appreciated.
