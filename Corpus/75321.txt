BODY : hi, i have a case where i need to show measures by pairs, so per dimension would need two stacked bars like in the image below ! stacked bars https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28447425/28662066-1ef0c7dc-72b9-11e7-87b6-6c716ce1f2f1.png so obviously with native bar chart in qlik sense it is not possible, only option is two bar charts. i see your extension is pretty powerful, is this feasible? if so could you give me a hint? i just downloaded it to test in my desktop version if not, is this something that could be worked on? unfortunately i have no idea on creating or modifying codes for extensions thanks for your reply!
