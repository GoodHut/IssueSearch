 URL : "https://github.com/mgravell/protobuf-net/issues/317" TITLE : uwp and net standard 2.0 BODY : i saw in some issues from the past about protobuf-net and uwp not working together. is this still the case? i was hoping net standard 2.0 would change this. i tried to use one of my .net desktop libraries that uses protobuf-net as a net standard 2.0 library and created a simple uwp app that launches a file picker to load a file and then a button to launch another picker to save it with a new name. i attempted to load a file that works in my desktop program and then save it with a new name. that resulted in an empty file. just wondered if it was something i did or if protobuf and uwp still don't like each other.
