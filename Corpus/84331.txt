 URL : "https://github.com/hardware/mailserver/issues/139" TITLE : cron error from logrotate BODY : just got this email from the container: etc/cron.daily/logrotate: invoke-rc.d: action rotate is unknown, but proceeding anyway. invoke-rc.d: policy-rc.d denied execution of rotate. googling it finds me this rsyslog fix committed in 2015 https://github.com/ouvrages/rsyslog/commit/ad4cc8949c9caa1e3c95389238f0b637a5325fa2 , but which appears to not be applied in this container's /etc/logrotate.d/rsyslog . but the build doesn't generate that file, so it appears that it's an older rsyslog version installed. the file date in the container is december 2015, so perhaps the fix hadn't made it downstream to the debian package yet. i must confess i lack the debian-fu to investigate further. :
