 URL : "https://github.com/IdealTF/IdealTF/issues/17" TITLE : all login issues BODY : the entire login system and user account system is being scrapped. while logins will still work, for older versions, this will soon be deprecated. this is due to a plethora of errors, bugs and issues which only made setup and installation harder for users and added hours of extra work to development along with about 2000 lines of code . the login system will be removed in v2.1.4 allowing no restrictions on anything. there may still be some stuff that will be broken due to this but it will be dealt with asap. the api and dev options will not work fix to come in v2.1.6 . all users will get the equivalent of a dev account and premium accounts do no longer exist for the time being . note: logins will still be supported and fully functional for all versions before v2.1.4 and after v.2.0.0. you can login as a admin account using the details, username and password in their respective slots! in v2.2.0 the login system will be killed and you will get an update prompt.
