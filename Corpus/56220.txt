 URL : "https://github.com/artix-linux/world/issues/6" TITLE : missing openrc scripts BODY : we have various missing openrc scripts from world and galaxy. i know this was intentional because we haven't adopted some of the packages that need them yet. however we have people with issues because they can't use their services. for example samba and apache don't have openrc scripts, which means people are not able to use those currently. should we go ahead and package the remaining openrc scripts even though we have not adopted those packages?
