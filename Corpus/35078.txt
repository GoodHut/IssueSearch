 URL : "https://github.com/me-box/databox/issues/121" TITLE : databox dashboard ui BODY : when a user clicks on the icon to uninstall an app, it's not clear that request has worked. it can appear as though either nothing is happening or that the user has accidentally clicked the refresh icon next to it. would be nice to give some indication that the box is in the process of uninstalling the app.
