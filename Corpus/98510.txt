 URL : "https://github.com/translate/pootle/issues/6084" TITLE : is there a related string? BODY : hi, the next issue from me: :- in fx 54 the following two strings exist: aboutsupport.sandboxsyscallindex _ _ and aboutsupport.sandboxsyscallage _ seconds ago _ are both strings related and will they form a string like number of seconds seconds ago ? it is important to know because sorbian languages use a preposition před, pśed instead of a postposition. besides the plural rules should be usable then.
