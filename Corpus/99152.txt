 URL : "https://github.com/testem/testem/issues/1063" TITLE : many chrome browsers start BODY : i'm using testem with and ember-cli project in dev mode launching chrome. when i'm pausing at breakpoints to debug and saving files as i fix things, testem will launch new instances of chrome. before long i'll have five instances of chrome running, all running my tests and slowing down my machine and hogging my cpu. is this expected behavior or have i configured something wrong? or is it a bug. i'm happy to poke around, but i'm not sure where i would begin.
