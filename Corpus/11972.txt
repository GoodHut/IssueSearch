 URL : "https://github.com/mapbox/MapboxDirections.swift/issues/158" TITLE : map matching api BODY : given the mapbox map matching api https://www.mapbox.com/api-documentation/ retrieve-a-match ’s similarity to the directions api, we could pretty cleanly implement support for the former in this library. here’s one possible design: the directions class would gain a new match _:completionhandler: method that takes a matchoptions object based on these options https://www.mapbox.com/api-documentation/ retrieve-a-match . the completion handler would accept an array of match https://www.mapbox.com/api-documentation/ match-object objects, an array of tracepoint https://www.mapbox.com/api-documentation/ tracepoint-object objects, and an optional error. match would be a subclass of route. tracepoint would be a subclass of waypoint. /cc @bsudekum
