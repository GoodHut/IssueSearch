 URL : "https://github.com/CrushedPixel/PacketGate/issues/2" TITLE : monitor for packet spam BODY : packet spam is kind of a big deal. let’s say for instance, a player is in creative. they enable “nuker hacks”, which constantly break literally any block, even air, around them in a 8x8x8 box. this floods the anti grief plugin, which can’t keep up and slowly bogs the server down until watchdog throws the instance out. an easy way to prevent this is to kick players that are sending way too many packets too quickly. protocolib had something like that, so it seems like this having that would be good as well.
