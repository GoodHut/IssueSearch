 URL : "https://github.com/aczwink/ACStdLib/issues/14" TITLE : strings and random access BODY : the requirement that class string must be random access fixed char length has a big performance issue. on linux, string should default to utf-8 because gtk and the kernel always use it, while on windows it should default to utf-16 because winapi expects this. while utf-16 is most likely fine for random access, for utf-8 its pretty unlikely that the chars will be all encoded using only one byte. without random access, the internal utf-8/16/32 pointer can be made mutual, so that the string is always logically constant but can change at any time its encoding. actually then there is no reason anymore to make it change its encoding at run time, so utf-8 and utf-16 would be sufficient. when random access is really indispensable, then acstdlib still offers utf32string and if one really needs utf-16 strings but with random access and make sure that nothing will break , one can either provide an own implementation or subclass utf16string and implement operator .
