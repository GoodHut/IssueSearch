 URL : "https://github.com/corcel/corcel/issues/302" TITLE : contact form 7 integration BODY : i'm looking to integrate contact form 7 with corcel. so for example i would create the form in cf7 and then output the form in my laravel view, possibly using the shorttag? . then i would submit the form back to cf7 which will provide a json validation response. if validation is ok then it would process the submission as normal. is this possible to do?
