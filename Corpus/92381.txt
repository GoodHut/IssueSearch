 URL : "https://github.com/devbridge/jQuery-Autocomplete/issues/618" TITLE : width computation problem BODY : it seems that computed suggestion box width is a little wider than it should be. it can be seen here: https://www.devbridge.com/sourcery/components/jquery-autocomplete/ if hide input selection border. ! image https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/765471/26469550/0f407608-41a3-11e7-918c-6b4d0da41661.png the reason is unconsidered border width, so if you set 1px width for suggestion box, you have 2 additional pixels of width that overflows input's one.
