 URL : "https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons/issues/483" TITLE : crossed out box BODY : hi, i'm trying to import custom icomoon font i have generated, but i keep getting crossed out box icon instead of icomoon icon. i copied font to android/app/src/main/assets/fonts, deleted the android/app/build folder. recompiled the project, changed from f to f and vice versa, i do not have fontweight or any style on icon tag. is there anything else i could do?
