 URL : "https://github.com/CEMPD/VERDI/issues/159" TITLE : add new file export types BODY : if we are stuck exporting only raster images like png, gif, etc. , instead of vector graphics ps and pdf , then please add the ability to control the size of raster images instead of being limited by the existing display screen resolution. raster images with a larger number of pixels look better when reduced for publication.
