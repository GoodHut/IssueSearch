 URL : "https://github.com/RainerKuemmerle/g2o/issues/167" TITLE : g2o memory leak BODY : there are many g2o instances in the demo cpp for memory using, for example in the g2o/g2o/examples/sba/sba_demo.cpp， it shows that: g2o::optimizationalgorithmlevenberg solver = new g2o::optimizationalgorithmlevenberg solver_ptr ; but we cannot find any delete memory command at the end of codes. so my question is how to release these memory usage？
