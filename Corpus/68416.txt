 URL : "https://github.com/debops/ansible-logrotate/issues/4" TITLE : role produces leftovers BODY : hi, thank you for implementing this role and opening it up to the community. i noticed that it produces leftovers though. assuming you initially have something like the following: logrotate__config: - filename: 'diamond.log' log: '/var/log/diamond/diamond.log' state: 'present' options: | compress gzip daily missingok nomail noolddir notifempty rotate 10 size 50m but then you realise you mistakenly added a .log in the configuration filename, and so you correct it to the following: logrotate__config: - filename: 'diamond' log: '/var/log/diamond/diamond.log' state: 'present' options: | compress gzip daily missingok nomail noolddir notifempty rotate 10 size 50m the diamond configuration will be placed correctly in /etc/logrotate.d but the erroneous diamond.log file will _also_ be there. whereby nothing but the expected should be placed in that folder. unless i am looking at it the wrong way of course.. thank you.
