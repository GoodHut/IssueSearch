 URL : "https://github.com/KaiKikuchi/QuickShop/issues/105" TITLE : tax account issue BODY : i'm using the latest version 0.9.29 as well as minecraft 1.11.2 with iconomy 7. i set up everything perfectly and it was working fine, the taxrate was at 20% and the tax account was working fine, if a player sold something they would pay taxes and the tax account would recieve the money. after closing the server and reopening the next day no changes to any files or any settings upon going to my shop area i noticed that the tax account was no longer receiving money when people were selling things to the shop. things i have tried: - double checked both tax account is under the same name - checked the tax feature is enabled. - checked the database to make sure there are no corruptions. - downloading clean version and default config. if anyone has had a similar issue and knows how to fix please let me know!
