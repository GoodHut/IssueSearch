 URL : "https://github.com/usc-isi-i2/Web-Karma/issues/340" TITLE : bulk refresh of columns? BODY : i am building most of my uris with uuids. the uuids are created in a new pytransform column import uuid return uuid.uuid4 .urn 9: and then pasting the uuid into other uri columns with another pytransform return 'heightdatum/' + getvalue row_uuid when instantiating a new source data table, i i refresh the uuid column with the circular arrow icon, but then i have to click the refresh icon for all 20+ columns that use the uuid. is there a way to do that as a bulk operation?
