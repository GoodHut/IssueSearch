 URL : "https://github.com/benjamminf/craft-neo/issues/76" TITLE : dynamic asset folders BODY : hi there, great product, i am having one issue that i hope to get some assistance with: the fields created with neo do not seem to display all images in the assets folder for the entry upon creation of the neo field when asset fields are dynamic. new fields: show what appears to be the last two items in our assets folder and one random other image. if i create module-1 i am able to upload an item directly to that block with no problem. if i create module-2 i am not able to see the image used for module-1. once i save the entry: i am able to see images in my assets folder as expected. so now i have module-1 and module-2. if i go to add an image to module-2 i am able to see the image used in module-1. i am then able to add the image from module-1 to also be used in module-2. if i create module-3 i once again do not see all the images in my folder. it is not till after i save the entry that module-3 displays the assets folder. expected results: once i create a new block of content with neo and go to my assets field i expect to see all images related to that entry, even if used in other neo fields on the same page. workaround 1: upload one image at a time as i create each neo block. this is not ideal if needing to use the image in multiple places on a page. a very edge case i know. workaround 2: create all our neo blocks and upload all images for page into assets. once page reloads we are then able to see all the images. issue: if creating new fields not able to access images till we save entry again. i hope i provided enough information for you. neo has been a great tool for me and can't wait to see where you take it! thanks, john
