 URL : "https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/15122" TITLE : opengl2 support query BODY : hello, heroes of godot engine. the work you did in godot 3.0 beta 2nd release is highly impressive. most of you are professionals in everything like scripting, ui, design and you professionals are quite fast too. so, i've liked most of the godot3.0. but, unfortunately, my pc uses intel r hd graphics 370m @ 240gz x 2, which doesn't has any official support for opengl3.3 / opengl3. unofficial builds of drivers have those support but those are very much buggy and for some reason they doesn't start with my start of windows. i've to start them each time. i currently use mesa3d software renderers i.e. code 'libgl_software_always=1'. the godot runs awesome but in case when materials is assigned, it lags, so, godot 3.1 will start with start of 2018, i've following query to ask - 1. can i be able to get glossy, mirror, sss, depth, metallic, albedo, normal, emission and other shaders support in opengl2 version of godot 3.1? 2. will pbr and other lightning effects be supported in opengl2 version of godot 3.1? 3. what will be the limitations that can't be implemented in opengl2 version of godot 3.1? here's my linux side graphics info - glxinfo | grep opengl - root@vaio-pc:~ glxinfo | grep opengl opengl vendor string: intel open source technology center opengl renderer string: mesa dri intel r ironlake mobile opengl version string: 2.1 mesa 11.2.2 opengl shading language version string: 1.20 opengl extensions: opengl es profile version string: opengl es 2.0 mesa 11.2.2 opengl es profile shading language version string: opengl es glsl es 1.0.16 opengl es profile extensions: root@vaio-pc:~ thanks in advance, and many wishes to team godot this new year!
