 URL : "https://github.com/brookhong/Surfingkeys/issues/357" TITLE : cookie management feature BODY : at work, i find myself having to go to cookie management page to remove cookies from a specific domain or from multiple domains. i would love to have this feature added to surfingkeys. i'm thinking of working on this myself but i wanted to check with you @brookhong and with the users. i am planning to add the command :removecookies which takes a regex and will remove any cookie with the domain matching it. but for that to work, we would have to grant the cookies permission, that'll prompt the extension users to re-approve the extension, but given that most users are tech savvy, i think that'd be fine. please vote.
