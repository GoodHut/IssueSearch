 URL : "https://github.com/LCAS/spqrel_tools/issues/45" TITLE : abort too long paths BODY : pepper_planner should implement a --max-path-length flag to set the maximum length of a path before it gets rejected. together with 44 this should avoid the massive detour planning that is not required when using topnav. it should instead trigger the thru-obstacle recovery behaviour in those cases.
