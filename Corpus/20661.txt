 URL : "https://github.com/coelckers/gzdoom/issues/189" TITLE : crashing on models BODY : i didn't want to report this as an issue as it could be the result of bad drivers that i can not update, attached is a crash report from an older version of gzdoom from during the zscript development , as the latest builds behave differently on the issue. when any actor with a model spawns including actors that are already placed in maps , gzdoom's window simply vanishes and the process stays in background processes in the task manager until i kill it, in the older version i get a crash log instead. crashreportsw.zip https://github.com/coelckers/gzdoom/files/688435/crashreportsw.zip
