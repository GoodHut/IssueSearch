 URL : "https://github.com/transceptor-technology/siridb-server/issues/74" TITLE : add tag support BODY : currently we can create dynamic groups based on a regular expression for grouping series but there is no way to manually add/remove series to a group. sometimes this is useful so we should implement tagging of series. syntax: tags should be created automatically as soon as a series is tagged. alter series a-group-or-even-a-tag-is-allowed , 'by-name', /or_by_regex/ where type == float add tag my-tag >in case a group exists with the same name, an error must me returned. no error should be raised if >a series has already a tag assigned. to add series to an existing tag is done with the same syntax: alter series 'my-series' add tag my-tag remove a tag should be possible: alter series 'my-series' remove tag my-tag >no error is raised if the series did not have the tag, an error should be raised when the tag does not >exist. tags should be list-able: list tags name, series where name ~ 'cpu' and series > 10 tags should be countable: count tags where name ~ 'foo' tags are removed as soon as a tag is not used anymore: alter series my-tag remove tag my-tag
