 URL : "https://github.com/chrisbreiding/zunder/issues/4" TITLE : implement tree shaking BODY : i have converted all these lodash imports in my project from import _ from lodash to import { map, etc } from lodash , but it doesn't seem to have made anywhere near a significant improvement in the file size of my project. i have heard that tree shaking will help and essentially treat this: js import { map, etc } from lodash like this: js import map from lodash/map import etc from lodash/etc
