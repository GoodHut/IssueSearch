 URL : "https://github.com/haffonist/igamt/issues/1945" TITLE : can't add a segment BODY : this functionality is confusing. i click on add segment and the create segment pop up looks like only lets the user add a field in an existing segment. but still if i try to add the field, it does not let me add it. am i missing something?
