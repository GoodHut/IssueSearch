 URL : "https://github.com/Tecnativa/docker-odoo-base/issues/14" TITLE : discussion unittests BODY : i find mqt quite handy up to certain extent it's a monolithic metamorph in order to execute testing, however preparing my local test bed is a pain and i am split brain among improving mqt or factoring out part of its' ideas into something like what you started here. what i like: - being able to build a template db to speed things up - being able to autodetect changes via a git reflog analysis, so it at leasts always tests automatically the modules i touched. - keeping db up and running, so it can soon double up as a more standard-ci/cd friendly runbot replacement. what i don't like there: - architecture and design are somewhat erratic and constantly changing. - it has the oca way in mind without being too much extensible so the question is: make or buy ? or drop, obviously
