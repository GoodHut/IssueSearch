 URL : "https://github.com/evoluteur/structured-filter/issues/12" TITLE : dropdown select filter BODY : it would be nice to give a predefined list of values for a filter. for example, if the data that was being queried only had x options for a field, would be nice to show all of them and let the user select the one they wanted. would use less screen space than a normal list of say 10 options, though would be limited to only one option? perhaps: javascript { type: selectlist , id: myid , label: birthmonth , list: {id: jan , label: january }, {id: feb , label: february }, {id: mar , label: march }, {id: apr , label: april }, {id: may , label: may }, {id: jun , label: june }, {id: jul , label: july }, {id: aug , label: august }, {id: sep , label: september }, {id: oct , label: october }, {id: nov , label: november }, {id: dec , label: december } } and then: javascript case ftypes.selectlist: var arraylength = this._field.list.length; h+='<select id= field >'+evoui.optnull; for var i = 0; i < arraylength; i++ { h+=evoui.inputoption this._field.list i .id, this._field.list i .label ; } h+='</select>'; break; just a rough sketch of a possible way?
