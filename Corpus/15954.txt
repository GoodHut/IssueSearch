 URL : "https://github.com/callemall/fasttext-js/issues/4" TITLE : getting data back BODY : i'm trying to change the code to keep an instance of the process around with the models loaded. i see in your source you called child.stdin.end and it seems that unless this is called, there is no output from fasttext. however, this causes a problem if i try to again send more std input to the child. unhandledrejection error: write after end do you have any other ideas how to flush the output, or otherwise re-open the child process for piping into without reloading it again? so also mentioned execa https://github.com/sindresorhus/execa
