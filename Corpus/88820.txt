 URL : "https://github.com/reactjs/react-codemod/issues/100" TITLE : output is wasting memory? BODY : is it possible to configure the wanted output here insteado f the current ? i would guess the result is equivalent so i don't understand why it produces inconsistent results, arrow functions for members and functions for react functions? current: js const react = require react ; class mycomponent extends react.component { onclicked = => { console.log 1 ; }; render { return <button onclick={this.onclicked} /> ; } } wanted js const react = require react ; class mycomponent extends react.component { onclicked { console.log 1 ; }; render { return <button onclick={this.onclicked} /> ; } }
