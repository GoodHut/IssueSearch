 URL : "https://github.com/project8/scarab/issues/9" TITLE : macros for boost::python BODY : there are lots of repeated forms that would be nicely made into macros, in particular something parallel to the membervariable macros already used in classes to .add_property to a class. something for .def should be added to keep things uniform. going to press on doing it longhand for now, but should figure this out and use it before pushing to wrap much of katydid. one concern is that katydid does not use the macros as defined in scarab, which means the method names are spelled differently set_<member> vs setmember . i need to use the macros in katydid and match method names in katydid, but it seems better for them to be implemented in scarab and used elsewhere.... not sure what's most consistent here.
