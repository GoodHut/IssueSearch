 URL : "https://github.com/Corecii/Spectrum/issues/6" TITLE : duplicate level-end votes BODY : shows vote prompt twice at once, but only one worked. if auto mode is turned off, the second one continues to display after every map, but does not work. each vote prompt shows different maps as if from the same level queue. when advancing a level, all 6 maps are skipped over/eliminated autouniquevotes = true . note: this happened in nico's v0.4 as well, so it's not a new bug introduced by new code.
