 URL : "https://github.com/robisim74/angular-l10n/issues/53" TITLE : it's just angular l10n BODY : because _it's just angular_, i renamed the library _angular localization_ is already taken by an angularjs library... , and because only a new name is useless, i made a code refactoring, with a lot of breaking changes. this project started only with one injectable class for translation at the beginning of angular 2 it was its name , and it has grown to become heavy, but i think that _clean code_ is important to manage the project. i also tried to make it more beautiful and simple to use, and especially to optimize performance and size thinking to the tree shaking , so that you can only import the modules and classes that are used. all the documentation is updated. greetings, roberto
