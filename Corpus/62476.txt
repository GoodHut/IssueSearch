 URL : "https://github.com/IonDen/ion.rangeSlider/issues/524" TITLE : commas to value results BODY : the script is great! i was easily able to add data-prettify-separator and have commas for the slider itself. i am currently showing the value x 2.5% underneath the slider. however, it is not showing the value with commas. for example, the slider is on $100,000 and the value show $2500 which is the correct formula but doesn't show as $2,500 which i would like it to. is there a way to easily accomplish this? thanks!
