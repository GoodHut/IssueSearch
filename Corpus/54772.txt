 URL : "https://github.com/billz/raspap-webgui/issues/53" TITLE : hostapd not restarting BODY : good afternoon folks. thanks for all the help in advance. i've tried a few things and cannot seem to get this to work. first thing is i set my /etc/dhcpcd.conf to comment out static ip settings because if i don't i do not get internet connection through my router after i setup as ap because it assigns me a local ip of 10.3.141.??. if i configure the ap to my router password it grabs an ip from my router and i can switch back to my network and log into the web interface again. here is where the problem is: if i remove the password for the access point and just want to go back to local access it hangs. it does not restart the hostapd service. it's dropping the ip and everything but it's not refreshing and picking back up a local ip. i have to stop and restart the hostapd settings or reboot the system. any ideas?
