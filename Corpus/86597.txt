 URL : "https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues/11192" TITLE : icon request: icon-mahara BODY : hello font awesome team, i'd like to suggest mahara as a new icon. mahara https://mahara.org is a popular open source eportfolio project used by schools, higher education and other organizations around the world. mahara integrates font awesome and all icons in its code base are font awesome. having the mahara logo as icon makes it easy to use it in the codebase as icon rather than image where needed. users can work more flexibly with the icon. the moodle learning management system has gone over to use font awesome icons and prefers that any icons are represented by a font awesome icon. having the mahara icon as front awesome icon would be beneficial so as not to use a generic icon: https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/mdl-58892 it would be fantastic to see the mahara logo, the rauiri , as a font awesome icon. the downloadable files are at https://mahara.org/artefact/artefact.php?artefact=432702&view=133484 if any other format should be provided, please get in touch. i attach the png version of the secondary logo, which is the one to be used as stand-alone icon, as reference as i can't upload the svg version. thank you for taking this icon request into consideration. kristina ! mahararauiri2017_156x300 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1209346/27250786-e137601e-538b-11e7-9ac4-d7e3e1c5fb4d.png
