BODY : great tool!!! üëè i'm currently using csvlink to, well, link csv files. : i have a authoritative.csv file that contains a list of manually curated product names and attributes. besides that file, i have a bunch of other store xyz .csv files that also contain a list of product names and attributes, but in a much messier and inconsistent format. the headers/columns are the same in all the files. my goal is to run csvlink to map as many products as possible from store xyz to authoritative ids: csvlink authoritative.csv storex.csv --output_file storex_curated.csv --field_names name brand model color csvlink authoritative.csv storey.csv --output_file storey_curated.csv --field_names name brand model color csvlink authoritative.csv storez.csv --output_file storez_curated.csv --field_names name brand model color since a lot of the individual stores will share common terms with the others, i wonder if it's possible to reuse the training data across several stores. or do i have to maintain a training.json file for every store pair?
