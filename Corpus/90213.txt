 URL : "https://github.com/afawcett/declarative-lookup-rollup-summaries/issues/493" TITLE : scheduled job not working BODY : hi, i have created a dlrs that summarizes a custom field from opportunity to the account record. i added a filter criteria so only closed-won opportunities and those which their contract end date is before today will be aggregated into the account level. i have tested the dlrs in real time mode and it works. then i tired to run a schedule job, following the instructions in https://github.com/afawcett/declarative-lookup-rollup-summaries/wiki/what-you-need-to-know-about-scheduling-rollups however though according to apex jobs the job has run successfully, the dlrs didn't work nor does it have any lookup rollup summary schedule items records. can you please assist? thank you, ron
