 URL : "https://github.com/AndrewRadev/ember_tools.vim/issues/11" TITLE : support linked addons BODY : i use npm link while in development so i can develop my addons and realize the changes immediately when running ember serve against my application that uses them. i was wondering if it is possible to have this plugin know about the source folder for my addon such that when i use gf on a handlebars component it'll find the source for it in the addon folder?
