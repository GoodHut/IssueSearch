 URL : "https://github.com/BIDS-Apps/baracus/issues/1" TITLE : option to run freesurfer BODY : moved from old repo: @chrisfilo: > it would be useful if this app had an option to take raw data and run the right version of freesurfer. sort of a a-z solution. i see a lot of people liking that option. @fliem: > good idea. do you have experience with calling docker container from within an other docker container e.g. freesurfer-docker from within barracks ? @chrisfilo: >there is docker in docker https://github.com/jpetazzo/dind, but i'm afraid that it will be problematic in many environments including singularity. alternative is to use freesurfer app as the base image. @fliem: > ok. i'll take a look during brainhack.
