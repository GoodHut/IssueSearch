BODY : hi, the peg set up file in mbuild/lib/moieties/peg.py specifies the up port to be 0.364, which makes the connection between two peg monomers 0.364 + 0.07 = 0.434 nm. this value is too large for a normal c-o bond. a value of 0.073 nm for the up port looks more reasonable according to the pdb file. thanks! qile
