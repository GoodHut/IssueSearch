 URL : "https://github.com/SMRFoundation/NodeXLBasic/issues/176" TITLE : source code compile error BODY : nodexl version 1.0.1.245
system: win 7 32bit
vs2010 10.0.30319.1 i fellow the howtobuildnodexl.txt unzip the zip file into any directory.
make copies of the original nodexl\exceltemplate .designer.cs files. there are eight of them: sheet1.designer.cs, sheet2,designer.cs, and so on.
open nodexl.sln in visual studio 2010, which starts the conversion wizard.
let the conversion wizard run to completion. the conversion succeeds without complaint, but unfortunately the .designer.cs files get mangled during the conversion.
overwrite the badly converted .designer.cs files with the copies you made earlier.
run build | rebuild solution.
but i got a error:
the type or namespace name 'folderpathcontrol' does not exist in the namespace 'smrf.applib' are you missing an assembly reference? i saw those file is in the outside common folder which doesn't contain in nodexl project.
does there anybody got this problem like mine? how could i solve this problem? this work item was migrated from codeplex codeplex work item id: '24993' vote count: '1'
