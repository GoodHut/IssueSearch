 URL : "https://github.com/aff4/aff4-java/issues/1" TITLE : resource license request BODY : could you please specify a different license for the tests or at the very least the files in src/test/resources ? i would like to use them in tests for my reader to keep the tests consistent across implementations, but lgpl isn't going to work for me, as that license doesn't make much sense with go, which pretty much requires static linking for all the things.
