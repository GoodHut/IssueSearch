 URL : "https://github.com/d-unseductable/ruru/issues/53" TITLE : get strings by reference BODY : - rstring::to_str &self -> &str - rstring::to_str_unchecked &self -> &str these methods are similar to to_string and to_string_unchecked . the difference is that they return immutable references to underlying ruby strings. the new methods do not allocate new string s on heap, thus they should be faster when a user just needs to get underlying data from ruby string.
