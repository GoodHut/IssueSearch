 URL : "https://github.com/TooTallNate/NodObjC/issues/97" TITLE : wait for objc block BODY : i want to wait for an async objc block to finish before returning from a javascript function. the problem is that the node process exists before the block is called by cocoa. how can i wait for the block and make sure node doesn't exit until after the block was called? i know that in objective-c, i can use a dispatch_semaphore_t , but i couldn't get that working via nodobjc . any ideas?
