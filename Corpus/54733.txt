 URL : "https://github.com/jaridmargolin/inspect-process/issues/41" TITLE : hide tabs and url bars BODY : hey, i don't know if it's easily doable, but i've been using devtool npm package for a while and they don't display tabs and url. i know it's an electron app so i guess they have the ability to do so. from what i understand you, on the other side, remotely control chrome. but does their api/protocol provide a way to hide those 2? i know it's not very important and purely aesthetic, but still, those 2 annoy me ðŸ¤“ thanks!
