 URL : "https://github.com/dsnopek/anki-sync-server/issues/66" TITLE : problem using nginx BODY : i'm trying to setup anki-sync-server in combination with nginx because i want to use tls configured on port 27702 . the anki-sync-server itself is working, i can sync when i connect directly to port 27701 over http. i used the recommended code snippet for nginx from the readme page. but i had to change line proxy_pass http://anki:27701; to proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:27701; because the orignal line was giving the error message: nginx: emerg host not found in upstream anki in /etc/nginx/conf.d/secure.conf:92 when i press the sync button in anki i get the error message: > syncing failed: > ankiweb is under maintenance. please try again in a few minutes. in the logfile of nginx it says: > 2017/05/03 00:24:18 error 2128 2128: 1783 connect failed 111: connection refused while connecting to upstream, client: 1.1.1.1, server: mydomain.net, request: post /sync/hostkey http/1.1 , upstream: http://127.0.0.1:27701/sync/hostkey , host: mydomain.net:27702 i replaced my ip adress with 1.1.1.1 and the domain name of my server with mydomain.net in the error message for privacy reasons
