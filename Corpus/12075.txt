 URL : "https://github.com/browserstack/browserstack-runner/issues/185" TITLE : mocha v3 support BODY : it looks like mocha 3 may not be supported. this https://github.com/browserstack/browserstack-runner/pull/179 might fix it, but what i'm seeing is only the passing test stat is getting recorded and all other values are showing up nan this means if a test fails, it doesn't fail the run.
