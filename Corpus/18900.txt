 URL : "https://github.com/evangipson/vueture-game/issues/4" TITLE : user flow cleanup BODY : - on hover of the password show eye thingy, make a tooltip come up and say show password - say 8 characters minimum for password if i'm going to enforce that - it's not clear to register if you don't have an account - maybe add a little line of copy above the form saying that or but it on the button itself, or perhaps detect if they are a user and show the button they need? that would be badass - the first time cait tried to login ... the fucking app just let her and she didn't have an account! what the fuck! make sure this doesn't happen. i was in an incognito window as well so i'm extra worried about this.
