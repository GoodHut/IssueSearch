 URL : "https://github.com/FePhyFoFum/quartetsampling/issues/2" TITLE : raxml quits with error BODY : hi, i'm getting a file not found error for .../temp/raxml_results files which are indeed not being produced . by re-running the raxml was called as follows: line for one of these, i can see that i get the following error from raxml: raxmlhpc-avx: evaluategenericspecial.c:3514: evaluateiterative: assertion partitionlikelihood < 0.0' failed. aborted the chunk of data being analyzed here has 455 alignment patterns and 12.65% undetermined characters. i've seen this error mentioned a few times on the raxml users group, and typically it does seem to be the result of a bug rather than something related to the input file. i will make a post on the raxml users group, but i thought i would mention it here as well as i haven't seen the error in my own raxml use. i've tried pointing quartetsampling to a few different raxml executables pthreads and serial, avx/sse3 and get the error regardless.
