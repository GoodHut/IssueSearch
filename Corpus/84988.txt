 URL : "https://github.com/coatue-oss/SlickGrid/issues/53" TITLE : edit functionality broken BODY : i switched from 6pac slickgrid https://www.npmjs.com/package/slickgrid to your repository to use the fixedcolumn functionality. a custom editor which worked with the 6pac slickgrid broke during this switch. i was getting an uncaught typeerror: this.updaterow is not a function at slickgrid2\dist\grid.js:3385 . i have traced down the error to the method slickgrid.commitcurrentedit slickgrid2\dist\grid.js:3407 . the problems are the execute and undo functions inside the editcommand object. when these functions are executed, this refers to the editcommand object but in the call this.updaterow this.row the first this must be the slickgrid object. i have attached a fixed version which i include in addition to your code. const slickgrid = require 'slickgrid2' .slickgrid; require './slickgrid.editor.fix.js' slickgrid ; slickgrid.editor.fix.js.txt https://github.com/coatue-oss/slickgrid/files/1003463/slickgrid.editor.fix.js.txt
