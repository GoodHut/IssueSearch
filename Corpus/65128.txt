 URL : "https://github.com/ri0t1985/api-creator/issues/10" TITLE : implement proxy support BODY : currently we scrape the target url directly, but some hosts might detect the incoming ip in the access log, and block it after a while. to prevent this, we want to allow the host to specify a list of proxies to use. we can implement tinyproxy to cycle through the proxies when scraping a site.
