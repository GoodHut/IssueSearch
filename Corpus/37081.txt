 URL : "https://github.com/SUSE/Portus/issues/1482" TITLE : js polyfills offline BODY : i'm currently running portus in a disconnected environment and experiencing some client side weirdness that i think is down to a lack of the polyfills loaded from https://github.com/suse/portus/blob/master/app/views/layouts/application.html.slim l33 as i've got no connection to polyfill.io. is there a way we can build some of the required polyfills in or does it specifically require the browser detection features of polyfill.io?
