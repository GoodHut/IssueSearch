 URL : "https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-js/issues/928" TITLE : broken image response BODY : hi i have an api-request that returns an image as response. when i try the feature with swagger-ui , everything works as expected but when i use swagger-js as client i cannot convince the image to appear. maybe im doing something wrong. in the swagger-ui code i can see, that the image is built with the following lines: javascript // image } else if /^image\//.test contenttype { var urlcreator = window.url || window.webkiturl; var imageurl = urlcreator.createobjecturl content ; when i try the same with the swagger-js client ... javascript client.attributes.getimage { attributeid: scope.attributeid, imagetype: 'available' } .then function res { var urlcreator = window.url || window.webkiturl; var url = urlcreator.createobjecturl res.obj ; img.src = url; } ; ... i get the following error: > failed to execute 'createobjecturl' on 'url': no function was found that matched the signature provided. appearently because the res.obj is somehow different from content in the swagger-ui code. any ideas? thanks in advance
