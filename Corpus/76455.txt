 URL : "https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/issues/4181" TITLE : keystone 4 documentation BODY : we recently made a big push to update our documentation, as well as streamline the process of updating it in the future. to that end, we've redone the documentation site using gatsby, and have put it up on netlify. what would be great is feedback on the documentation we've got. if you've got some time, a bit of a review would be amazing. the most important pages to look at are: - the getting started page http://keystonejs.netlify.com/getting-started - yo generator guide http://keystonejs.netlify.com/getting-started/yo-generator - setting up guide http://keystonejs.netlify.com/getting-started/setting-up/part-1 - documentation launch page http://keystonejs.netlify.com/documentation the questions i'm most interested in are: - can i find the information i want? - is the information clearly presented? feedback is welcome here, or if you find an issue you can solve, you can make a pr to the docs https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/tree/docs branch. thanks in advance!
