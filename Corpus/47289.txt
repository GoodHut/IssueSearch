 URL : "https://github.com/CDRH/orchid/issues/9" TITLE : orchid gem via github BODY : on both the server and my workstation, adding the orchid gem to a new rails app gemfile via github seems to fail during app generation with: ruby /usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-2.4.1@orc/bundler/gems/orchid-6ea5a22ad959/lib/generators/setup_generator.rb:107:in gems': undefined method api_bridge_version' for orchid:module nomethoderror adding the gem via the path: '...' approach works fine on both though.
