 URL : "https://github.com/drdhaval2785/siddhantakaumudi/issues/40" TITLE : add appendices to html BODY : the dhatusuci is quite impressive. @kmadathil it would be great if we have the following appendices. 1. sutras sorted alphabetically. 2. sutras sorted in ashtadhyayi order 3. vartikas sorted alphabetically. 4. paribhasas sorted alphabetically. 5. dhatusuci already implemented . these should be easily extractable items. some xslt magic will make it happen i guess. what is your say ?
