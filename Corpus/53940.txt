 URL : "https://github.com/crsh/papaja/issues/151" TITLE : failed to compile .tex BODY : hello, first of all, thank you all for the good work! i'm new to papaja but it already seems to be a powerful package. i managed to knit my text into a docx file and everything looked fine. however, i could not produce the pdf file and it seems to be stuck at this step and gives the error message: sh: pdflatex: command not found error: failed to compile papaja_test.tex. execution halted i'm using r 3.4.0 and rstudio 1.0.143. i downloaded the latest mactex and removed previous versions of latex as well. it may be some very simple mistake, but i would really appreciate your help here. thanks!
