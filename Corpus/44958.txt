 URL : "https://github.com/walkerke/tigris/issues/38" TITLE : get requests rejected BODY : at the moment on my computer, get requests by tigris are being rejected, meaning that functions will fail when tigris_use_cache == true . download.file , used otherwise, is working fine. i've put in a note to the census bureau to see if there is a reason for this behavior - otherwise i'll need to modify the code to use download.file instead.
