 URL : "https://github.com/lekro/elosensei/issues/17" TITLE : add delta mask event BODY : current delta events are inline. this means they will affect ratings of players other than the one they are set on. having a delta mask event would allow points added from achievements, removed by punishments, and other manual changes to remain neutral for elo rating, but still reflect on the player's status. todo: - add column for delta mask in the user status df - add delta mask event, rename delta inline event to delta_inline - add logic to update players using delta mask only the delta_mask column is updated for users - add logic to show players' masked scores this can just be a function get_masked_elo which first calls get_elo and then adds the mask - add logic to show both raw elo rating and masked scores in the player cards - top players by scores, or by rating? or both
