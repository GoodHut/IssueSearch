 URL : "https://github.com/alanshaw/br-chrome-tabs/issues/4" TITLE : npm module name BODY : @adamschwartz and i would like to publish the original chrome-tabs module https://github.com/adamschwartz/chrome-tabs on npm under the name chrome-tabs , but we noticed you are already using this name for br-chrome-tabs. @alanshaw would you agree to rename your npm module to let @adamschwartz take over this name? we believe this would be clearer for users. if you accept, i could contact the npm team to ask for the change. otherwise we would publish chrome-tabs under another name. our full discussion: https://github.com/adamschwartz/chrome-tabs/pull/31 issuecomment-329553966 thank you!
