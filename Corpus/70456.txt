 URL : "https://github.com/Cal-CS-61A-Staff/ok/issues/1162" TITLE : way too many score tags BODY : all these are necessary for grading, but not all of them should be exposed in the kind dropdown. for example, staff shouldn't have to manually assign any of them except for regrade and composition , with the rest being either automatically uploaded via autograding/composition grading, or deprecated i don't think we need partner a and partner b scores ! snip20170706_4 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8680381/27945372-845f9008-62a1-11e7-9bbf-1e7453e6d9d9.png @kevinlin1 do you have any thoughts?
