 URL : "https://github.com/SHOREdevelopers/COVE/issues/61" TITLE : update php syntax BODY : i'm not sure this is a real issue, just recording it so the knowledge isn't lost: when installing cove studio on my dev environment, i was unable to launch it, tracked the problem down to a php issue. php 5 allows for a break syntax which is now a fatal error. actual message: _ 23-oct-2017 10:34:59 america/new_york php fatal error: 'continue' not in the 'loop' or 'switch' context in /users/andrew/dropbox/code/performant/drupal/cove/sites/all/modules/ref_field/ref_field_sync.module on line 51_ workaround is just to run under 5 which appears to be what pantheon is doing, so no problem related: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34871198/fatal-error-break-not-in-the-loop-or-switch-context-in
