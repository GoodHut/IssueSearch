 URL : "https://github.com/Codeinwp/wp-product-review/issues/210" TITLE : improve comments rating BODY : i would like to improve how the ratings are stored and how they affect the review. right now the comments rating is affecting only the global rating value, the individual options are still still using the editors rating. some users get confused because the comments ratings are no reflected to the review options too. also another issue is that the top widgets rating is sorting the rating correctly when the user influence is on. in order to fix all those issue i suggest the following changes: 1 alter the setup_options , check if the comment influence is turned on, and use get_comment_options to alter the options based on the user reviews. make sure you alter the options rating according to the influence setting. 2 in order to solve the top rating widgets issue, we will need to store the comments average rating rating, returned by get_comments_rating in a post meta and update it each time someone adds a new comments review. in this way we will have the review rating and comments rating separated. the next thing will be to edit the query model class to order the results based on a sql math operation which will use influece rating, comments rating and review rating, similar with this but at sql level: https://github.com/codeinwp/wp-product-review/blob/master/includes/admin/models/class-wppr-review-model.php l681 let me know if you have things clear.
