 URL : "https://github.com/Caleydo/taggle/issues/401" TITLE : axis labels alignment BODY : when adding new numerical column, axis labels are aligned to left and right side, so the whole label can be visible. after reloading the page, the labels are center aligned, and stay like that, so the labels are no longer readable. same thing happens after changing the width of the column. ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8986080/26968343-fbac8b44-4d01-11e7-85f3-8cbf1b64ec18.png ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8986080/26968356-08a8551c-4d02-11e7-9b02-18af8cc7e5fb.png
