 URL : "https://github.com/Cycling74/miraweb/issues/121" TITLE : mira.frame and m4l hangs BODY : difficulties arise when using miraweb inside of m4l, especially when switching between the editor and live. the symptoms are the essentially the same sort of thing that were happening in my earlier reports max hangs when trying to instantiate mira.frame . it seems to be a port lock, perhaps the external instance with its bound port isn’t getting released when switching to editor, so isn't available to reset it when switching back to live? to reproduce, you can simply create an amxd with an mira.frame.help patcher in it and save it. 1. add the amxd to live. 2. connect mira or miraweb to it. 3. open the amxd in the editor. at this point, i can sometimes get mira to connect to the editor version, but chances are good you won’t be able to control the mira.frame from the app 4. close the editor. for me, this causes max editor to hang, and i have to force quit. other strange things happen as well, like no connection via miraweb or mira, or if a connection is possible, mira.frame either doesn’t display in app/browser or works improperly if it does . at other times, live itself will freeze when loading the patch after the editor has been opened and closed. the only way to semi-reliably get things working again is to close all instances of live/max/mira on all connected devices, disconnect my machine from network, and start over again. i've tried this on multiple machines, multiple networks, mira.app and miraweb, situation seems the same regardless. i've gone as far as generating the mira.frame via scripting after loading a patch, and deconstructing it before switching to the editor manually, but problems persist.
