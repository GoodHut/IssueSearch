 URL : "https://github.com/indywidualny/FaceSlim/issues/228" TITLE : open link in private tab BODY : firstly thanks for the development of such a useful app. i really like using it because of its privacy value and openness. feature request: as almost all external links i'd like to visit lead to sites that are noting but privacy collectors my phone gets really fat of all those cookies , would it be an idea to be able to open all links in a private firefox tab by default? and only a long click would show all other options if you like. as for these other options, i usually choose to copy such a link to clipboard first and then open it in a private tab. but somehow this sharing-option disappeared from my phone android 6 . probably after upgrade to fs3.0 or after installing some other apps. now it's quite a hassle to open a link in a safe enviroment. br - erik
