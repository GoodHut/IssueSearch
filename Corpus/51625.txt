 URL : "https://github.com/chipsenter/Jammming/issues/5" TITLE : avoid writing to state BODY : https://github.com/chipsenter/jammming/blob/master/src/components/app/app.js l27-l32 when you write some code like javascript let somearray = this.state.someproperty; somearray.push ; you are directly mutating react's state, which is considered a bad practice. react's state should only be changed by this.setstate because this method in turn signals to react that a component needs to be re-rendered. directly mutating the state does _not_, which can cause complications. consider using a non-mutating array method instead, like slice , concat , map , or filter which all return a brand new array instead. you are then free to mutate that _copied_ array and then pass the final version of that copied array to this.setstate . here's an example: javascript let updatedplaylisttracks = this.state.playlisttracks.concat track ; this.setstate { playlisttracks: updatedplaylisttracks } ; read more about immutability in react here https://medium.com/pro-react/a-brief-talk-about-immutability-and-react-s-helpers-70919ab8ae7c .
