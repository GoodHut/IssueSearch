 URL : "https://github.com/akrabat/rka-ip-address-middleware/issues/8" TITLE : capturing any ip BODY : maybe i am missing the point. but my goal is to capture any ip from any request made to my rest api so i can keep track of them in a database. i am using slim 3 and when i use composer to load the middleware i use it like this and it always returns null from my localhost. require '../vendor/autoload.php'; $app->get '/api/v1/customer', function request $request, response $response { $requestip = $request->getattribute 'ip_address' ; var_dump $requestip ; echo $requestip; return $response; } ; from my understanding this is options if you only want to accept request from certain ip, $checkproxyheaders = true; // note: never trust the ip address for security processes! $trustedproxies = '10.0.0.1', '10.0.0.2' ; // note: never trust the ip address for security processes! $app->add new rka\middleware\ipaddress $checkproxyheaders, $trustedproxies ; when i add that into my app the output is this, string 3 ::1 ::1 if i am trying to capture the ip from the request is that $trustedproxies optional? if it is not optional how can i accept request from all ip? to achieve my goal what am i missing here? or am i getting the expected result and i just do not realize it?
