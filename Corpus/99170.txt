 URL : "https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/issues/2433" TITLE : marauder ship descriptions BODY : the marauder ships have lovely descriptions! but i don't know of anywhere in-game that i can actually see them â€” are they actually shown anywhere other than in the shipyard screen? if not, that means that a lot of the rather enjoyable descriptions are actually inaccessible.
