 URL : "https://github.com/janinko/ghprb/issues/458" TITLE : can't remove contexts BODY : when i created the job, i didn't set any context, so it created the <code>default</code> one. i then wanted to change that because i was going to add more checks to <code>linting</code>. that new context was added to the existing one. meaning i then had two contexts - the old <code>default</code> one and the new <code>linting</code> one. i then tested to add a <code>set github commit status universal </code>. that seems to also have added a context! so now i have three test context. and even though i've removed all of them from the job, as well as restarted jenkins and opened a new pr , all three are still there. all linking to different job numbers in the same job.
