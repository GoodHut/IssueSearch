 URL : "https://github.com/openstf/stf/issues/562" TITLE : android o compatibility BODY : this is a tracking issue for android o. status as of developer preview 1 https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/03/first-preview-of-android-o.html : not working. minicap reports the following error: > cannot link executable /data/local/tmp/minicap : cannot locate symbol _zn7android11bufferqueue17createbufferqueueepns_2spins_22igraphicbufferproducereeepns1_ins_22igraphicbufferconsumereeerkns1_ins_19igraphicbufferalloceee referenced by /data/local/tmp/minicap.so ... clearly, a recompilation for o is needed, but google hasn't released an aosp branch for o dp1 yet, so it can't be done yet. it may be possible with some dlsym trickery, i might or might not take a look into that later.
