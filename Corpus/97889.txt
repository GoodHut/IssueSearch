 URL : "https://github.com/avalonmediasystem/avalon/issues/1658" TITLE : i want to ingest mts files BODY : descriptive summary matterhorn throws an error at the inspection process if the container is mts, and the file is not processedâ€”the ingest doesn't happen and matterhorn reports an error. relevant portions of the matterhorn log from iu production avalon are attached in a log file. if the video and audio streams are copied into an mp4 wrapper, everything works as expected. it's just the mts-ness of it all throwing a wrench in the works. per the avalon supported formats page, mts streams but not containers are supported. in a born-digital world, support for mts should be available. done looks like the error logs from matterhorn when attempting to send through an mts file are examined and further action is decided upon, whether that's changing a config file or moving mediainfo or ffmpeg versions. matterhorn_inspectfailed.log.zip https://github.com/avalonmediasystem/avalon/files/807086/matterhorn_inspectfailed.log.zip
