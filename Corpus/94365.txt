 URL : "https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid-cookiecutter-starter/issues/17" TITLE : can we have a random port? BODY : currently, every project is set to run on 6543. this is annoying if we want to run two projects at the same time. this could easily be fixed if we randomly choose a port between 6000-9999 each time we gen the project. i'll do this if you like the idea.
