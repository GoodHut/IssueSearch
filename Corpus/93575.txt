 URL : "https://github.com/jedfoster/Readmore.js/issues/194" TITLE : aftertoggle not triggering BODY : this is not actually an issue with the code, but the documentation could be explicit about this pitfall: if speed is set to 0, aftertoggle does not trigger because there no transitionend event gets generated. i spent a long time trying to figure out why aftertoggle was not being triggered, and the reason makes sense. i just wanted to document this somewhere in case someone else encountered the same problem.
