 URL : "https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/4138" TITLE : synchronous node api BODY : <!-- please don't delete this template or we'll close your issue --> <!-- before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of webpack. --> <!-- also consider trying the webpack@beta version, maybe it's already fixed. --> do you want to request a feature or report a bug ? feature <!-- please ask questions on stackoverflow or the webpack gitter https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack . --> <!-- issues which contain questions or support requests will be closed. --> what is the current behavior? node api is only asynchronous i believe what is the expected behavior? js const webpack = require webpack ; const compiler = webpack { // configuration object } ; compiler.run err, stats => { // ... } ; this is the current node api. i'd like a version that runs synchronously and returns an object {err, stats} or just stats and throws an error when an error occurs. if this is a feature request, what is motivation or use case for changing the behavior? jest allows for transformations to be done on files that are imported and instead of creating separate transformation configuration, i think the simplest thing to do would be to re-use my webpack configuration and just change the entry file to be the individual file i'm trying to compile and give the results to jest. unfortunately, the transformations for jest need to be synchronous and i don't see a way to run webpack synchronously via the node api. please mention other relevant information such as the browser version, node.js version, webpack version and operating system. n/a
