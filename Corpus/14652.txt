 URL : "https://github.com/OpenAngelArena/suggestions/issues/287" TITLE : boss suggestion 7 BODY : $bosss arena large. boss $bosss are two identical big monsters in the middle of the arena. they attack in melee. they may cleave. aurastep=200 note - phase hp thresholds only require one $boss to hit the thresholds to begin the phase. phase 1 100-50% hp $bosss have the following passive ability: $ability1: aura with 11 $aurastep radius. other units in the aura not the holder gain +220% damage -20% for each $aurastep distance from the holder. phase 2 50-0% hp $bosss gain the following ability: $ability2: $boss charges the other $boss, catching any units in the way and pushing them along. $bosss cast $ability2 simultaneously on each other. units compacted between $bosss when they hit each other finishing the charge take $high physical damage. phase 3 0% hp one $boss has died due to reaching 0% hp. the other $boss loses $ability1 and gains $ability3 instead. $ability3: +300% damage until death. strategy pull $bosss apart to minimize impact of $ability1. repeat after each time $ability2 happens. try to make sure one $boss is very low on hp when the other $boss dies to minimize length of phase 3. this is different from the twin boss because pulling $bosss together is a bad idea here. stand-in fluff boss=brute demon // totally not a magnataur $ability1=empowering aura // trust me there's no relation to empower $ability2=bro hug // demon horns are not used to skewer units charged $ability3=enrage
