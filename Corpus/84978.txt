 URL : "https://github.com/openMSX/openMSX/issues/1066" TITLE : easy way to find osd menu BODY : a user who knows openmsx for a very long time only just found out about the osd menu and liked it. he wondered why he didn't know about it before. i guess we should/can make it a bit easier to find. some ideas: - at first run, open the osd menu and/or a pop-up to explain how to call it. - add some kind of clickable button to open the menu. drawback is that it would be always visible... perhaps add a menu item in the osd menu to make this invisible? ;-
