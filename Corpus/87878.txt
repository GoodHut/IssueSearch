 URL : "https://github.com/eht16/python-logstash-async/issues/11" TITLE : memory cache with timeout BODY : hey! first, thanks so much for this library. i would like to implement a backend that does not persist to disk. i'm thinking of doing this by adding a ttl on the messages along with some new config values. if i did this and submitted a pr, would you be interested in accepting it?
