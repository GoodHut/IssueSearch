 URL : "https://github.com/mapbox/tilejson-spec/issues/25" TITLE : bounds where left > right BODY : if i have a tile source that goes from west of australia to ~east~ right of new zealand, i would expect to be able to write the bounds as: 90, -70, -170, 70 // left, bottom, right, top unfortunately this doesn't seem to produce a valid tilejson in mapbox gl js no tiles are requested for this source . it's not possible to workaround this by just switching the left/right longitudes, because that represents all the negative space where there is no data. leaving the only possible workaround to specify the entire -180°/180° range: -180, -70, 180, 70 , this results in a lot of unnecessary requests to the server that just result in 404 responses, and also prevents the ability to draw a border around the bounds. however it works from a user perspective because all data is shown. extending the bounds beyond 180° to 190° below results in appropriate requests, but nothing between 180° and 190° with mapbox gl js as the implementation . -90, -70, 190, 70 should the spec be able to support bounds where the left longitude is greater than the right longitude?
