BODY : the latest version of satoshis from curse v1.3.1 causes craftbukkit 1.7.9 to hang after announcing that it is downloading the blockchain, in a manner somewhat like this: 16:08:42 info : satoshis enabling satoshis v1.3 16:08:42 info : satoshis connecting to peers... 16:08:42 info : satoshis downloading blockchain... the server becomes entirely unresponsive to commands at this point.
