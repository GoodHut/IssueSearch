 URL : "https://github.com/codeforamerica/cfapi/issues/308" TITLE : add csv bulk download BODY : hey, what do you guys think about adding a bulk download option to create a csv of the data. the use cases are: 1 internal folks who just want to copy-paste a quick list of brigade information like twitter handles or something and know how to use excel but not curl 2 people in the brigade community being able to access the data without needing command-line skills i have been working on a spreadsheet that i'd love to migrate into the cfapi https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zglhakdunnvkindahb6k_djalq_myrygkve2dtyolaq/edit gid=1596547592 but, right now, i can't in good conscience suggest that folks use the cfapi since it's much less user-friendly than a simple google spreadsheet.
