BODY : hi! thank you for your great work! i'm balbuze. i wrote a plugin for volumio https://volumio.org/ an audio os using mbeq. i met the following problem : sometimes or on certain system, instead of the sound, i get a frying sound or something like a pink noise. if i stop playing and restart, everything is ok... do you know special value to be set in asound.conf buffer, period to avoid it. the problem occurs with mpd, or spotify connect on arm system rpi , pine64 or even speaker-test. other question : is there a interest of using sepexrate as resampler with mbeq ? thank you. the asound file : ctl.equal { type equal library /usr/lib/ladspa/mbeq_1197.so module mbeq } pcm.plugequal1 { type equal library /usr/lib/ladspa/mbeq_1197.so module mbeq slave.pcm plughw:0,0 ; } pcm.equal { type plug; slave.pcm plugequal1; }
