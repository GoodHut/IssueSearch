 URL : "https://github.com/hadley/devtools/issues/1601" TITLE : full gpl license BODY : when trying to submit one of my packages to cran, i got the following message: > please do not provide a full copy of the gpl but only use the license file for specifying any possible restrictions. is this a new cran restriction? if it is, it would be useful to modify the behaviour of devtools::use_gpl3_license .
