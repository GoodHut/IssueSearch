 URL : "https://github.com/unclebob/fitnesse/issues/1032" TITLE : one way ssl configuration BODY : hi, i was following this guide http://www.fitnesse.org/fitnesse.fullreferenceguide.userguide.administeringfitnesse.networksecurity on how to setup ssl in order to test a https protected endpoint, but still haven't had any joy. im trying to run tests, whereby i am running fitnesse locally but aiming to execute requests against a remote webservice. i have a truststore, for a corresponding internal https protected webservice, provided by my company which i have in a local directory. i have extended the sslparameters, creating a class - com.myapp.appium.customsslparams, and specified the location of the truststore within the class. this is available on my classpath. i have also modified the plugins.properties, adding the following entry - slim.ssl=com.myapp.appium.customsslparams fitnesse starts fine with the following command: java -jar fitnesse-standalone.jar -p 8082 , however when i click 'test' to execute a test, it gives the following output: trying to connect to host: localhost on port: 8085 ssl=true ... and then prints a series of creating ssl client: localhost:8085 messages the fitnesse page shows a warning - unable to start test system 'slim': fitnesse.slim.slimerror:error connecting to slim server on localhost:8085 it seems that fitnesse is trying to communicate securely on port 8085 with slim server, but all i want is to be able to tell fitnesse is how to communicate securely with a remote webservice. is it possible to detach these settings? any help would be appreciated, thanks in advance!
