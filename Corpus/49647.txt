 URL : "https://github.com/KryoEM/relion2/issues/16" TITLE : unblur_tbz frames bug BODY : very small bug with unblur_tbz.py -- if i set first frame to a positive number, but do not bother to indicate a last frame defaults to 0 , i get an assertion error: traceback most recent call last : file /shared/relion/relion2.0/relion2.0.2_custom/python//unblur_tbz.py , line 308, in <module> dose_per_frame, vol, pre_exp, first_frame, last_frame file /shared/relion/relion2.0/relion2.0.2_custom/python//unblur_tbz.py , line 236, in main_mpi assert last_frame >= first_frame assertionerror i can get around it of course by setting last frame to a number, but raising issue for user-friendliness.
