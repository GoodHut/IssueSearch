 URL : "https://github.com/caseycrogers/Dogbone/issues/26" TITLE : latest version won't work BODY : i've been using previous versions of dogbone for ages, and it's worked great for the most part , but after i updated it thinks for a while, and then the program ends, and nothing has changed to the selected geometry. an item is in the undo section, but no dogbones have been created. anyone else having any issues? i've tried deleting and reinstalling. any help would be greatly appreciated, as i have hundreds of these to do.
