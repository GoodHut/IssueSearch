 URL : "https://github.com/mainanick/kerasplugins/issues/1" TITLE : how do i set this up? BODY : this looks super helpful! where do i get the tokens and configure telegram, etc? also, would you mind making it load the tokens from a file by default like keras does with ~/.keras/keras.json perhaps ~/.keras/kerasplugins.json ? that would make it easy to use and hard to commit secret keys to a repository. :-
