 URL : "https://github.com/shawncplus/ranviermud/issues/296" TITLE : refactor quest system BODY : currently quests have to be written in a javascript file which is a pretty terrible experience for builders that aren't also programmers. high level goals allow quests to be defined in a yaml file like items and npcs. this will allow for quests to be created entirely in soma assuming the required goal and reward type classes exist implementation details rewards quest reward should be an array of questreward objects that have give and display methods. example reward types currencyreward itemreward array items if items is an array render itemutil.displayitem by splitting two item displays on \r , looping over max item 1 arr len, item 2 arr len , use '' experiencereward goals quest goals should have the option to require completion in order and to only reveal subsequent goals when preceding goals are completed, e.g., travel to room a, once that's done, travel to room b appears as the goal core changes quests.js should be replaced by quests.yml new bundle types: quest-rewards and quest-goals update bundlemanager to load in new reward and goal bundles, assign reward and goals to questfactory there will be some changes needed to questfactory create for instantiating the goals and rewards bundle changes the ranvier-quests bundle will have to move the goals from lib to the new quest-goals bundle type ranvier-areas will have to rewrite the quests.js to the new format
