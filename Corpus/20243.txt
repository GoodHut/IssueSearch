 URL : "https://github.com/varspool/Wrench/issues/106" TITLE : call for bc breaks BODY : is there something not quite right that should be refactored in wrench? now's the time to suggest a fix. the 3.0 branch is open, but doesn't yet have a stable release. that means we can currently accept sensible bc breaks to master. after a few weeks with no further bc breaks proposed, i'll prepare a stable release of the 3.0 branch.
