 URL : "https://github.com/revelrylabs/revelry_core_node/issues/70" TITLE : docs site upgrade BODY : right now, the docs site is pretty barebones and doesn't really show off the styles of the framework. would like to build a site that has: - actually bring in our new default scss - a static home page that explains what the framework is and why you want to use it - a well organized component gallery with examples and prop documentation - can we make the examples into codepen style things editable in page ? - documentation of any global variables and settings
