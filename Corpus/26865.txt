 URL : "https://github.com/Cockatrice/Cockatrice/issues/2355" TITLE : card database error BODY : <b>os:</b> os x 10.11.6 <b>cockatrice version:</b> 3498b16 ___ <br> i'm not sure if this is the right place to report this, but i would like to report a problem with the card database i downloaded from the default link in cockatrice. the problem is with kamigawa flip cards. i'll use rune-tail, kitsune ascendant as an example. only the flip side, rune-tail's essence , shows up in the card database and the text for the card only includes text from this side.
