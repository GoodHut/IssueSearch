 URL : "https://github.com/oborel/obo-relations/issues/141" TITLE : parasite vs pathogen BODY : are there any guidelines for using parasite relations vs pathogen relations? is pathogen_of restricted to single-celled organisms? where do we want to draw the line? the example i'm thinking of is dirofilaria immitis, which causes heartworm disease in canines. it could easily be thought of as an internal parasite, but it also causes a disease. which is best? thoughts?
