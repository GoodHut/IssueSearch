 URL : "https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/1365" TITLE : check if window is visible BODY : this is a follow up to 1061. here is the code i would like to be able to write, which currently is not possible: bool wasdisplayedyet = imgui::windowwasactive title ; if !wasdisplayedyet { imvec2 textsize = imgui::calctextsize filename ; imgui::setnextwindowsize imvec2 textsize.x + 200.f, 100.f ; } imgui::begin title, &displaydialog ; so i want to compute the size of the window, but only if i need to, i. e. if the window wasn't visible before. i could compute the preferred size, then pass it in as the third parameter to begin , but that only works the first time the window. the other option would be to call setnextwindowsize , which is only possible before calling begin . but in order to check whether or not the window was already visible, i can only call iswindowappearing after calling begin . so i can't use that either. the documentation says setwindowsize is not recommended, but it's the only way i got this to work without modifying imgui. and it causes the window to jump after the first frame, which is not pretty.
