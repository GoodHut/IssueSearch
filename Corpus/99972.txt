 URL : "https://github.com/jorgecarleitao/pyglet-gui/issues/30" TITLE : not working from the start BODY : i apologize if this sounds more like asking for help rather than reporting an actual bug, but i am really stuck and not a whole lot of people knows this library, so i thought i should ask here for help. i can delete it afterward if it's doable in git newbie here... i installed the module and it was working a couple days earlier. however, i left it for a few days and now it's giving me all kinds of errors. 1. in the setup.py file, under the pyglet-gui folder, it's giving me filenotfounderror : filenotfounderror: errno 2 no such file or directory: 'readme.md' even though readme is in the directory 2. in the example files, python can't execute the first line:, from setup import it would say no module named 'setup' i'm also not sure what does import .setup does. it would just say no module named .setup 3. i tried pip installing, and i tried to follow the documentation, and i failed at the first button. it would give me a 'pyglet resource not found' exception and mind me to check the spelling. i have tried placing the theme folder in various places and it's just not working.. thank you so much for answering and i really appreciate it!
