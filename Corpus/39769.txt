 URL : "https://github.com/aaronsace/MultiPoolMiner/issues/668" TITLE : status: failed, why? BODY : hello, there are several times that it fails when it switches between algos. it seems that it is always the same algos that fail, for example x17 was failing over and over. i don't know whether i need to download any package myself or this is a normal issue. as far as i know it tries to get some packages but some fail. as an example i'll drop the log here, i see that it fails but i don't see why so i cannot correct the issue. 2017-12-13_09-11-28.txt https://github.com/aaronsace/multipoolminer/files/1557001/2017-12-13_09-11-28.txt thanks
