 URL : "https://github.com/sockeqwe/mosby/issues/214" TITLE : mvi - retry intents BODY : i'm using the mosby mvi library for a demo app that performs simple crud operations on a restful api using retrofit2 in my interactor . i constructed the viewstates very similar as in the sample app, containing throwable when retrofit responds with an error. in this case the render function displays an error screen with a retry button. when the retry button is clicked i want to re-emit the last item for the intent that failed. i would like to do add something like retrywhen to the intent , which of course is only triggered by onerror is there a simple way of adding this kind of behavior?
