 URL : "https://github.com/jetstack-experimental/cert-manager/issues/31" TITLE : consistent log messages BODY : right now we don't have a consistent log format. previously, kube-lego has used structured logs provided by logrus throughout the codebase. i'm happy to use this sort of approach, but we need to come up with a consistent strategy/policy for how we log, to save multiple similar log messages/nested logs too much.
