 URL : "https://github.com/Azure/azure-documentdb-dotnet/issues/321" TITLE : graph api and etag BODY : i see that gremlindocumentquery.graphcommand has an internal cache of vertices that have etags, but they are not exposed publicly. is there a way for me to get etags for vertices without querying for the documents again using the regular docdb api? another related question is if i have a query that looks like this: g.v .has 'pet', 'llama' .property 'awesome', 'true' ; is it treated as a transaction? i'm using microsoft.azure.graphs 0.2.4-preview and microsoft.azure.documentdb 1.17.0.
