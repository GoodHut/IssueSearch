 URL : "https://github.com/eggheads/eggdrop/issues/348" TITLE : update server list error BODY : if a bot is compiled without tls for example, if libssl-dev isn't installed and set servers has only ssl enabled servers in the list, the bot will not count those servers as valid. it will not start and show the slightly misleading no server. message as the error, when there are indeed servers set- just not ones that are valid without tls functionality enabled. suggest adding a check to see if the list is truly empty or if the list is empty as a result of invalid tls servers, and update the error accordingly.
