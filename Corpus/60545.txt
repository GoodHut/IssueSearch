 URL : "https://github.com/ITHIM/ITHIM/issues/16" TITLE : about population counts BODY : it seems like there is only one population count file f.csv . it is used to calculate population mean active travel time for both baseline and scenario. but in our case, the scenario is in future year, and the population counts in future year is different from the baseline counts. so, iâ€™m wondering if we could add one more file e.g. f.scenario.csv to store the future year population counts? and revise the calculation method for future year mean active travel time accordingly. and last time, you mentioned we could update f file by using: createithim activetransportfile = filename , gbdfile = filename , ffile = filename but actually, _ffile_ is not included in this createithim function. issue from yizheng wu @yzhwu
