 URL : "https://github.com/dotnet/templating/issues/1307" TITLE : nunit test templates BODY : should nunit templates be included out of the box or would you prefer that the nunit team maintain them? either way i am happy to do the work. we've had quite a few users ask us for templates and many people are confused thinking that nunit doesn't support .net core because the other major test frameworks are included out of the box but not nunit.
