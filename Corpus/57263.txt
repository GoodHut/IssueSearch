 URL : "https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/data-store/issues/816" TITLE : prevent zombie bundles BODY : two cases come to mind where a deleted bundle version may become visible again. a bundle version is submitted after a uuid-only aka unqualified, aka unversioned tombstone is created. the bundle version will be not be tomstoned since the tombstones for all matching bundles are only created once, during the indexing of the tombstone. during index repair some time may pass between the processing of a bundle which will add the bundle to the index and the processing of the tombstone. during that time, the original bundle will be visible in the index. i propose that we modify the indexer to always check for a tombstone before indexing a bundle and then do the right thingâ„¢.
