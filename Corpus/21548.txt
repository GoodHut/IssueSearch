 URL : "https://github.com/uscensusbureau/opportunity/issues/64" TITLE : fix the dap script BODY : the script to call dap ga is modified with a parameter that is not supported by dap, and is blocking data from being sent to the dap account: <script src= js/federated-analytics-min.js?agency=doc&subagency=cen&gwt_uaid:ua-44450756-1 id= _fed_an_ua_tag ></script> please remove the gwt_uaid parameter so that dap can actually track data to this site. in contrast, one can use pua=ua-44450756-1 in place to send data to both dap and that independent account.
