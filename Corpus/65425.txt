 URL : "https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/502" TITLE : integration of vue-i18n BODY : hey guys, i'm just porting our vuejs project to nuxtjs. so far everything worked. but now i have to include this plugin: https://github.com/kazupon/vue-i18n the problem is, we have to do something like this in order to make it work: import i18n from './i18n' const app = new vue { router, store, i18n, ...app } the i18n.js file looks like this: import vue from 'vue' import vuei18n from 'vue-i18n' vue.use vuei18n export default new vuei18n { locale: 'de', fallbacklocale: 'en' } i already added it to the plugins section inside the nuxt.config.js: plugins: '~plugins/vuetify.js', '~plugins/i18n.js' , but it says this.$t is undefined. i think we need to add it into the new vue ... part. is it possible to get this plugin into this part? thank you so much for this great work!
