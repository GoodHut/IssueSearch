 URL : "https://github.com/guillermobox/theo/issues/16" TITLE : verbose and quiet flags BODY : add verbose and quiet flags to control how much information. verbose should have at least two levels. one to be verbose, another to be incredibly verbose, dumping all sorts of diagnostics. on the other hand, the default behaviour should to be specially quiet, except when something wrong is found. so, if a suite passes, only the name of the suite and the fact that it has finished succesfully. if any error appears, show more information about what happened.
