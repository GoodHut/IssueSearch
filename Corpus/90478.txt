BODY : i have a very non-linux compatible soundboard. it took me quite a while to be able to use the internal mic and headphones. saw many kernel-related posts about the alc256. after a year, linux still can't detect when i plug in the headphone. i can select it manually in pavucontrol: ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9389043/28313784-808c9872-6b8e-11e7-9d75-fdcfe88671f0.png can't see it when not selected: ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9389043/28313813-95a536e2-6b8e-11e7-8b54-4b0a88c1b524.png can see after selected: ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9389043/28313831-aaea1ff4-6b8e-11e7-8069-85308597fde3.png but can't select it in this extension, it only shows after i select in pavucontrol, if i go back to speakers, it no longer is shown there. i wish i could select show unplugged ports in this extension's configuration, so unlucky people like me could hack they way to happiness. i'm willing to make a pull request, but i've never dealt with gnome extensions, and it would be nice to have a little briefing before start. i'm not even sure that the problem is the unplugged status.
