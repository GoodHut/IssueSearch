 URL : "https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-dcat/issues/93" TITLE : license element format BODY : currently the dcat:distribution has a node formatted like this: <dct:license>http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/</dct:license> https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/node/150347 states, that licenses should always be noted as uris and their example puts the uri inside an rdf:resource -atttribute: <dct:license rdf:resource= http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ /> is there a good reason to not change the output to use the rdf:resource-notation if the value for dct:license is an uri? non-uris could be written in current format as literal, in case somebody enters all rights reserved or something like that
