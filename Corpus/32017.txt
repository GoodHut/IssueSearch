 URL : "https://github.com/mediarox/pagespeed/issues/24" TITLE : this is now useless BODY : it seems with recent changes this extension has zero benefit. simply moving css and js before body end won't cut it anymore. even inlining critical css will have zero effect. i am not sure if this is happening because the css should be moved completely outside of the html or because the critical css is still part of the external file. anyway, as of now this is extension is useless.
