 URL : "https://github.com/20tab/UnrealEnginePython/issues/168" TITLE : unreal doesn't start BODY : hi there, we've installed your plugin on a couple pcs and it works fine except one which every time we try to open a project that includes the plugin, the splash screen disappears as soon as it reaches 70-71% and ue4 stays in the background doing nothing no matter how long you leave it there. we get no crashes or anything like that. we tried multiple ue4 versions, and multiple versions of the plugin. we also tried to start fresh new project, run ue4 as admin etc. nothing seems to work. the most annoying thing that it doesn't give an error. it just stays in the background doing nothing. no activity cpu etc . double checked that we have the latest x64 python 2.7 installed. any idea what might be? thanks, nick
