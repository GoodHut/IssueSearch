 URL : "https://github.com/pkulchenko/ZeroBraneStudio/issues/840" TITLE : macbook pro touchbar BODY : on a macbook pro, we are blessed with a touch bar, which shows context sensitive stuff based on the application's sophistication / whathaveyou. for applications that do not support the touch bar, you can tell the mac to default to function keys: https://www.imore.com/how-make-function-keys-default-touch-bar-display however, this doesn't work for zbs. i don't know why, but the mac is not able to identify zbs when you use the method described above and so you don't get the function keys. this makes many of the default shortcuts a pain in the butt. it'd be awesome if: - zbs told the mac to display function keys on the touch bar when zbs was active. - actually used the touch bar to show context sensitive information when editing/debugging/searching/etc.
