 URL : "https://github.com/brunch/brunch/issues/1684" TITLE : brunch doesn't require css BODY : description brunch doesn't require css. in projects like spectacle https://github.com/formidablelabs/spectacle there are require s like these https://github.com/formidablelabs/spectacle/blob/master/src/components/component-playground.js l26-l30 : if usedarktheme { require ../themes/default/dark.codemirror.css ; } else { require ../themes/default/light.codemirror.css ; } brunch can't handle such require s, so it fails: ! image https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3459374/24051430/bbd2b68c-0b3a-11e7-8436-ab7ac6e2aca9.png quite confusing, because it's problem with vendor not with my code itself. expected behavior when brunch meet styles require , then require should return a string with styles ? or css-modules object if they are enabled and empty object if they are disabled . i think it have to be discussed. actual behavior style modules isn't defined and js errors occurs. other useful files, when present log, bower.json etc. ref to 1473.
