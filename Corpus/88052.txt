 URL : "https://github.com/googlei18n/noto-emoji/issues/164" TITLE : missing scripts for flags BODY : in https://github.com/googlei18n/noto-emoji/blob/master/third_party/region-flags/readme.md url there is a section called scripts , which says: the script regions.py lists all regions with their metadata. the script regions-wp.py shows the wikipedia url for the flag page. the script missing.sh shows all such regions that we don't have flags for. the script make-aliases.sh makes symlinks for regions that use flag of another region. the script download-wp.py downloads missing flags from wikipedia and generating optimized svg and png versions. none of these scripts are available in the whole project. how am i supposed to fetch all the missing flags then? emojipedia lists about 15 flags which are missing in the current version.
