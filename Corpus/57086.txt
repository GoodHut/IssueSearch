 URL : "https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC/issues/669" TITLE : pip install indi-tools BODY : i was following the installation page http://fcp-indi.github.io/docs/user/install.html to install cpac. in the last step where i was checking the cpac installation i got an error related to indi-tools, stating that it is not installed even though i ran the previous command and installed all the python dependencies within a miniconda environment. later, i ran pip install indi-tools with an upper-case t indi-tools instead of indi-tools . this installed indi-tools successfully.
