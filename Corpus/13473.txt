 URL : "https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/issues/902" TITLE : upper camel case BODY : as i implemented the first activation function in src/mlpack/methods/ann/activation_functions i used lower camel case for the function names instead of upper camel case as used throughout the codebase and as stated in the design guidelines: https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/wiki/designguidelines the goal of this ticket is to find and to replace them with the correct style: fn -> fn deriv -> deriv inv -> inv
