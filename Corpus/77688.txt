 URL : "https://github.com/schellingb/TinySoundFont/issues/9" TITLE : not muting playing notes BODY : hi again! playing a single note note_on, note_off quickly results in sharp reverb cut off. i found a temporary hack which fixed this maybe not ideal but works tsf.h commit 7f29067 line 1160 onwards: for v = f->voices, vend = v + f->voicenum; v != vend; v++ { if v->playingpreset != preset_index continue; ifndef set_lossless if v->playingkey == key tsf_voice_endquick v, f->outsamplerate ; if v->region->group havegroupednotesplaying = tsf_true; endif } you can hear the difference here: https://soundcloud.com/martin-minovski/tsf-test https://soundcloud.com/martin-minovski/tsf-test ignore the buffer underruns. if i pre-render the samples instead, it sounds perfect with the hack enabled. could be nice to have that as a setting variable which can change during runtime. 👍 cheers martin
