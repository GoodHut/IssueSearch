 URL : "https://github.com/godotengine/collada-exporter/issues/47" TITLE : add tuple to exporter. BODY : hi there. i modified the script to get rid of the error about endswith expecting str or tuple, not frozen set. changing this if condition in line 189: if img_tmp_path.lower .endswith bpy.path.extensions_image : to: if img_tmp_path.lower .endswith tuple bpy.path.extensions_image : solves the problem perfectly. it's too little of a change to clone and make a pull request, so i will leave this little fix as an issue here. i exported a couple of times with no problems, i can't tell for sure if it will ever present some undesired behavior, but so far it does the job. thanks.
