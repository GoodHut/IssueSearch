 URL : "https://github.com/thirtybees/thirtybees/issues/389" TITLE : fix for friendly url BODY : hey guys, i am re-creating my prestashop website using thirtybees on a new domain. however i have run into a small mystery for the friendly url. prestashop always used the category id as part of the url, which used to irritate me. however i find now its the only solution available to me. i have a category called home, which has a bunch of sub categories. this category is for household items i will be selling. so naturally the is also a home category under which all of this falls under as well as a root i am unsure why there is a need for both which means the url rewriting breaks and gives me a 404 error page which also then breaks styling for that page as well . i have to change the seo rewriting. so i thought i would just pre-pend the word category before all teh categories, however this has no effect for me. so i have to then pre-pend the category id by writing {id}-{rewrite}, seems this is the only way possible. is there perhaps a better way for doing this?
