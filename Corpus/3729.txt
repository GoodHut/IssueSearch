 URL : "https://github.com/elliotchance/mbzdb/issues/73" TITLE : too much data BODY : hi first i would like to thank you for the great work. but i'm having some trouble. the database has too many entries for me to handle. i tried editing the perl script but i have no experience with perl and just fucked it up... is there an easy way to specify which tables i want to create and keep replicated in my db? cheers lisa
