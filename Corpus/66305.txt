 URL : "https://github.com/ARM-software/tf-issues/issues/474" TITLE : minor makefile problems BODY : building on a machine with 40 processors has revealed minor problems in the makefiles. 1. the macro make_prereq_dir has a minor bug, in that it is capable of generating recursive dependencies. 2. the inclusion of build_dir in temp_obj_dirs left no explicit dependency, build_dir may not exist when subdirectories are created by a thread on another cpu. 3. some recent changes have added direct use of the echo command without parameters. this fails on a windows shell, because echo without parameters reports the mode echo is on .
