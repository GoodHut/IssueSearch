 URL : "https://github.com/content-strategy-forum/csf-glossary/issues/38" TITLE : term: adaptive content BODY : i'm proposing this term in place of a different one proposed by lisa trager, 'adaptive web design'. i feel the latter term awd was beyond scope. by changing the label to 'adaptive content', we have something to consider more feasibly.
