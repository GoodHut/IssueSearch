 URL : "https://github.com/plumdog/flask_table/issues/76" TITLE : jinja not rendering table? BODY : i am writing something up based on the docs but i have an issue i can't figure out. basically the table is created fine, and when explicitly printing the <table>.__html__ i can see it is generating the html but jinja is not replacing the tag with the html. for simplicity sake i have: class mytable : <stuff> htable = mytable mytable.getitems the getitems method just runs a static query and fills the results then in the html file, lets call it myhtml.html: <stuff> {{ htable }} <other stuff> is this not correct? i'm not terribly sure. as i said, when i do print htable.__html__ it is definitely producing the correct html but maybe i am missing how to pass it to jinja?
