 URL : "https://github.com/torilmud/issues/issues/241" TITLE : paladin weapon options BODY : in light of the recent paladin update, i would like to pose this for serious consideration, that the warmaul of celestial glory be made paladin-able. it sees very little functional use by clerics as it is, with paladins potentially becoming a meta tank now, i think the warmaul would greatly suit them. i believe the holy and unholy avengers also need be looked at, they still need appropriate holy/unholy enchantments, and holy avenger procs could use a serious look at usefulness as well.
