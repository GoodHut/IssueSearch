 URL : "https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/issues/4805" TITLE : menu item inconsistency BODY : save state and load state close the menu along with there undo options but restart does not. this was one of the issues with my rebootemu hack for pcsx_rearmed: https://github.com/libretro/pcsx_rearmed/commit/53e4a7e5cb46ad8589825ec95e15b56614cc54d9 there pushing restart then load state would break the load state, but only one menu option should be possible at once.
