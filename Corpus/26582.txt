 URL : "https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/1359" TITLE : bower is deprecated BODY : this is about the docs . problem bower is still maintained, however the team behind bower recommends switching in their blog https://bower.io/blog/2017/how-to-migrate-away-from-bower/ . solution i would suggest adding a notice to the documentation that it is suggested to switch from bower to yarn or webpack .
