 URL : "https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux/issues/2061" TITLE : lightbox not transparent BODY : hey aksonov, we are having difficulty getting a transparent modal to pop up over our home screen. perhaps this is related to 2033, or we may just be doing something wrong. here is our router stack: <provider {...stores}> <router createreducer={reducercreate} {...sceneconfig}> <scene key=“lightbox” lightbox {...sceneconfig}> <scene key=“modal” modal hidenavbar {...sceneconfig}> <scene key=“root” hidenavbar hidetabbar> <scene key=“login” component={login} type=‘reset’ direction=‘vertical’/> <scene key=“splash” component={splashscreen} initial type=‘reset’/> <scene key=“home” component={home} type=‘reset’ direction=‘vertical’></scene> </scene> <scene key=“test” component={modal} /> </scene> </scene> </router> </provider> we've moved around sceneconfigs to a few different spots to see if we can get it to do something different to no avail. thanks in advanced!
