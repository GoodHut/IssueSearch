 URL : "https://github.com/dustinblackman/Championify/issues/260" TITLE : most used itemset source BODY : there must be people like me that doesn't know much about these itemset websites and which one is better for use. in my opinion, it would be nice to have a way to see what people choose the most i tried to import every itemset source but that's a bit crazy or a way to rate a itemset source so other people can see the total rate of it.
