 URL : "https://github.com/KirkMunro/FormatPx/issues/7" TITLE : formatpx.dll source code BODY : i see that the source to formatpx.dll is not included in this repo, and unfortunately decompilers do not appear to do a good job of understanding the binary. as including the source directly within the repo would mess up your install-githubhostedmodule script, would it potentially be possible to include a zip of the binary's source in a response to this issue, or as an attachment to releases? regards, lordmilko
