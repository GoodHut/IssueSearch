 URL : "https://github.com/yandex/ClickHouse/issues/522" TITLE : uniq on cluster BODY : i have a billion row table in a 3 node cluster setup . when i run queries for straight agg functions like sum , count etc on distributed table it works fast. but when i run uniq on dist table , it is much slower than running uniq on local table on 1 node. one one node uniq came back within 5 secs. while uniq in dust table came back within 11 secs. how do you make it fast?
