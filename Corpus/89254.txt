 URL : "https://github.com/shirkdog/pulledpork/issues/300" TITLE : problem downloading rules BODY : hi, my first time using pulledpork. version is 0.7.3 with snort 2.9.11 . i am unable to download the relevant rules file because it is attempting to get https://www.snort.org/reg-rules/snortrules-snapshot-2910.tar.gz/<my oinkcode> - which doesn't exist when i try in my browser. however adding a 1 to the snapshot version so the url is https://www.snort.org/reg-rules/snortrules-snapshot-29110.tar.gz/<my oinkcode> - does work in my browser, so presumably would in pulledpork. how can i fix this please?
