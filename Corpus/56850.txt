 URL : "https://github.com/daniel-samson/sass-bootstrap-theme/issues/2" TITLE : optimise compile times BODY : during the initialisation the editor should convert the sass into json. this gives us a partitioned tree which can be used to only compile the the selectors and properties that have changed. as longs as we ensure the sass selectors are compiled in the correct order this should not effect how the output css is displayed. the process read through each line: remove any comments replace ';' with ',' wrap '' around text which starts with '@' @import 'file name' becomes '@import': 'file name', $variable: test; becomes '$variable': 'value', add ',' to the end of a line wrap '' around properties split lines by : add : where necessary output { 'file_path': { '@import': 'variables' , '@mixin subnav ': { 'property': 'value' , }, 'selector': 'property': 'value' , '@include subnav ' , , } , } when the user changes a variable we can search the tree to see which selectors contains the variable. then we can generate a sub set of the sass files to only have the selectors and only have the properties in that selector. by reducing the amount of sass data we pass in to the sass compile, we can reduce the amount time it takes to compile sass. in addition to this we could keep a cache of the css out put for each selector. so that we only send newly changed values to the sass compiler. yet saving even more time.
