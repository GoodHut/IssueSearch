 URL : "https://github.com/drolsen/DRO-Matic/issues/87" TITLE : build topoff amount screen BODY : after much testing and diagnostics, confirmed that moving into next regimen must happen within topoffs not flow rate checking. in light of this, no longer is it appropriate to make ec correction or rather topping off time based, but instead amount based. we need to build out a topoff amount screen to allow users to set how many gallons of topoff should be used during ec correction and topping off plants.
