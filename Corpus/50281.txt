 URL : "https://github.com/Azanor/thaumcraft-suggestions/issues/102" TITLE : wisps as golem brains BODY : perhaps you could use wisps as an early ai not very strong, and can only carry a single item at a time, but can activate a marked arcane ear if an enemy enters their patrol area, and even attack based on their essence alignment . then, once golems become available, players find they need to merge specific wisps into the blank cores as an extra cost to get the specific, and useful, cores. you could go one further, and require the primal essence addons require crafting a wisp into as well.
