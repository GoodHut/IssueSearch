 URL : "https://github.com/jsplumb/jsPlumb/issues/667" TITLE : add jsplumb source to npm BODY : first of all, thanks for the great project. it would be really great to add the jsplumb sources src folder to the npm package, so one could require the code directly within a build system like webpack. there are currently two use cases for us: 1. we do not need everything of jsplumb. 2. we do want to use a modified katavario library.
