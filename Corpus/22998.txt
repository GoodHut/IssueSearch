 URL : "https://github.com/ganguli-lab/twpca/issues/4" TITLE : new loss functions BODY : users should have the ability to specify different loss functions. a few easy ones: - logistic loss spiking data where there is at most 1 spike per bin - poisson loss spiking data with multiple spikes per bin - gamma loss for calcium imaging data in the case of logistic/poisson loss functions, this would remove the need to smooth the data as a preprocessing step see https://github.com/ganguli-lab/twpca/issues/2 , but would necessitate adding regularization for smoothness on the temporal factors. this could also help with https://github.com/ganguli-lab/twpca/issues/3 - e.g. the reconstruction can be interpreted as a probability of spiking in the logistic case.
