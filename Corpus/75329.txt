 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19509" TITLE : gui becomes unresponsive BODY : - vscode version: 1.8.1 - os version: ubuntu 14.04.5 issue occurred on older versions of 14.04, and windows 7 steps to reproduce: 1. load a folder with c++ code ~200k lines 2. compile, launch, and debug code gcc as usual 3. after leaving the tool open for somewhere between 24-48 hours, the gui will eventually become unresponsive, sometimes sections of the window turn black. the gui lockup usually occurs while navigating the code. the window can be resized, resulting in more black area. button clicks still seem to have an effect. keyboard commands will still trigger a builds. hovering the mouse over areas where the buttons should appear bring up the hover-help text. the only recovery is to restart the window. work is never lost because saving still works after the screen no longer updates.
