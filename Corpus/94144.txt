 URL : "https://github.com/qoomon/maven-git-versioning-extension/issues/3" TITLE : branch is added to version BODY : trying to have the both version and branch as part of the snapshot name. current config snippet: <branch> <pattern>. </pattern> <versionformat>${version.release}-${branch}-snapshot</versionformat> </branch> </branches> seems the branch is added to ${version.release}, as we get quite a long snapshot name after a few runs. from pom version 1.0.7-snapshot after first run on branch branch-deploy , the name is: 1.0.7-branch-deploy-branch-deploy-snapshot. this keeps adding up: 1.0.5-branch-deploy-branch-deploy-branch-deploy-branch-deploy-snapshot
