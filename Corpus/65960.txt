 URL : "https://github.com/jmoenig/Snap--Build-Your-Own-Blocks/issues/1795" TITLE : login errors w/ cookies BODY : it's a semi-frequent occurrence that something weird with cookies causes users to be unable to log in. we definitely should provide some work-around for this, but i'm not sure what... 1. simple: the error message for can't connect can give some recommended actions. 2. can we delete cookies when an error happens? i don't know if this is the best thing to do, but it seems like deleting cookies just for snap! would allow people to log in again.
