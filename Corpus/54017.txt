 URL : "https://github.com/tkchia/gcc-ia16/issues/13" TITLE : feature request: -mrtd BODY : it would be nice and may not be too hard to implement -mrtd as already implemented for i386 where functions issue ret n instructions, so the callee pops the stack. the freedos kernel saves space using that. most dos compilers implement this via the pascal calling convention which also reverts the order and capitalizes symbols but that would be another project and more difficult i think. capitalizing symbols is easily done using asm symbolname but i don't know if gcc is set up at all for reversing stack argument order.
