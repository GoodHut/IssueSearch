 URL : "https://github.com/Netflix/security_monkey/issues/854" TITLE : justified issues score BODY : i have justified some issue, but they still show the same score. this confuse me, becouse i though that after i justify the problem, it is acknowledge as something normal and no longer higher my score. i would like to clean up my account with either fixing issues or justfying it, so and the end of the day i have a score or zero . then next day i can check what are new issues. is there a way to achieve it ? thanks.
