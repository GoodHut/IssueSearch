 URL : "https://github.com/capnkirok/animania/issues/250" TITLE : pets won't stay! BODY : great mod, honestly great mod. the models are so amazingly done and freaking adorable, however i can't get my hamsters, hedgehog damn you sanic!!! to stay in one spot. if i tp anywhere they will appear there, and a lot of the time they will randomly go from sitting to free-roam and it's gotten hard to keep them in one place. may i suggest some sort of pet cage? something we could put the hamsters and ferrets and hedgehogs in without worrying they will disappear or run off?!?
