 URL : "https://github.com/couchbase-partners/google-deployment-manager-couchbase/issues/8" TITLE : deal with scripts BODY : we currently have a startup script working well. the scripts are going to get a bunch more complex though. ideally we'd separate them out. that could be done by sticking them on github and downloading them. that introduces a dependency on github that it'd be nice to avoid. i've asked chris if there's any way to import through dm and land scripts on the boxes. one alternative would be building them as string in py, though then they have to be escaped properly and formatting issues will surely abound.
