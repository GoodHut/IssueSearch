 URL : "https://github.com/VojtechMyslivec/letsencrypt-zimbra/issues/21" TITLE : diff. errors with 8.7 BODY : ok, i did this: 1. first i installed https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/installing_a_letsencrypt_ssl_certificate on 8.7 with ./letsencrypt-auto certonly --standalone -d hostname.domain -d webmail.domain and it's working, although i'm not sure this is correct configuration per: zmcertmgr viewdeployedcrt > subject= /cn=hostname.domain > issuer= /c=us/o=let's encrypt/cn=let's encrypt authority x3 > subjectaltname=hostname.domain, webmail.domain 2. when i tried to use, with 8.7 dev branch: ./obtain-and-deploy-letsencrypt-cert.sh hostname.domain webmail.domain i got errors: > unable to start tls: hostname verification failed when connecting to ldap master. > obtain-and-deploy-letsencrypt-cert.sh err : restarting zimbra failed. i see it's some frequent error, i guess it's about those domain names. 3. in order to test, i used --staging in script but, with --staging or with --standalone, when i commented --non-interactive --quiet --agree-tos \: 3.1. i was again asked for domains, is it ok? > please enter in your domain name s comma and/or space separated enter 'c' to cancel if ok, maybe it should be explained - but i'm afraid those 2 domains are not used. 3.2. i got: > ./obtain-and-deploy-letsencrypt-cert.sh: line 258: --email: command not found why? i see there are other issues, some of this may be duplicate, but it's more appropriate to write all here then to comment on other issues.
