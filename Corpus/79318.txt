 URL : "https://github.com/badges/shields/issues/875" TITLE : semver tags not updating BODY : when i add a repo tag with a version number prefixed with a v , the shields badge will properly update. but if i add a tag without a v , it does not update. for example, i created a tag https://github.com/stylishthemes/stackoverflow-dark/tags 2.9.37 today and 2.9.36 ten days ago, but the shields badge is still showing v2.9.35 when i did include a v prefix. ! https://img.shields.io/github/tag/stylishthemes/stackoverflow-dark.svg https://img.shields.io/github/tag/stylishthemes/stackoverflow-dark.svg i don't want to start a debate https://github.com/mojombo/semver/issues/204 about valid semver, but i think that a tag without a v should update the displayed tag.... semver 2.0.0 states that a v prefix is not a valid semantic version https://github.com/mojombo/semver/blob/master/semver.md is-v123-a-semantic-version , but git tagging documentation https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/git-basics-tagging only shows examples of tags with a v prefix.
