 URL : "https://github.com/jamen/browser-window/issues/4" TITLE : pure js apps BODY : with our window.load , you can make electron apps without creating html and css files: js var app_entry = path.resolve './app/index.js' window.load <html><body><script>require '${app_entry}' </script></body> , { type: 'text/html' } it would be cool if there was a way to bootstrap js files even easier.
