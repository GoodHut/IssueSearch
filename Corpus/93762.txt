 URL : "https://github.com/wizmer/syncorg/issues/36" TITLE : app crashes after bad sync BODY : tried to setup a sync with our gitlab server. couldn't get it to work, it crashed. now i cannot open the app, as it crashes immediately. cannot change the sync settings to try again as it crashes before it can really open. i tried to clean the cache, but that does not help, i tried re-installation, but that also doesn't help. so i'm stuck now with an unusable syncorg app. i have no idea how to get it working again, so i can check the sync settings and maybe adjust.
