 URL : "https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls/issues/978" TITLE : 2.5 broke the abi BODY : while packaging 2.5.1 for debian, i noticed the abi has been broken in a few small places. these functions / variables have been removed: libmbedcrypto mbedtls_aes_decrypt mbedtls_aes_encrypt libmbedtls mbedtls_ssl_ciphersuite_uses_ec mbedtls_ssl_ciphersuite_uses_psk libmbedx509 mbedtls_test_ca_crt_rsa_len mbedtls_test_cli_crt_rsa_len i see that for the first 4, you have added static inline stubs to the headers to maintain api compatability. unfortunately doing this does not maintain abi compatability - you need to put the stubs in the libraries for that. the last 2 still exist in include/mbedtls/certs.h and anyone trying to use them will presumably get a linker error. you should either with a strong preference for the first option : add the symbols back into the library. increment the soversion on all 3 libraries to force everyone to rebuild. in the meantime i will add some stubs to the debian package to maintain abi compatability.
