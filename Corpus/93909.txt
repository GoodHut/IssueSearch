 URL : "https://github.com/gokrazy/gokrazy/issues/25" TITLE : auto-updating from gokrazy BODY : as discussed offline, it would be great, if gokrazy would support full auto-updates driven by gokrazy itself . it would probably require shipping a copy of the go tool and the packer, regularly checking for updates via the github api, fetching a tarball of the content as we won't have git/mercurial/svn on the rpi if there is one, rebuilding the image and rebooting. most of this can probably be built as a service, though some changes to the packer are required: a the packer needs to add a released binary of the go tool we probably don't want to do a full recompilation? and b it needs to add meta-information about the build, so that the packer running on gokrazy can rebuild it. it's probably also worth it to consider user-packages for auto-updates, though the process is probably going to be different. most third-party things probably shouldn't be built from head, so either we need to rely on some kind of versioning scheme to decide what to update to, or rely on github releases and download binaries. updated versions should first be written to and started from /tmp, to make sure that they start correctly. afterwards, the packer needs to build a new image containing the updated binary. i think in the end we'd want auto-updates both for gokrazy itself and the user-installed services, to have fully self-updating appliances.
