 URL : "https://github.com/Gozala/alias-quokka-plugin/issues/1" TITLE : vue.js + webpack support? BODY : first of all, thanks for such an awesome plugin. it's really useful. if i could wish for one thing, it would be support for vue.js in a webpack environment. i spent a good amount of time trying to get your plugin working with their setup e.g. import x from @/something/here , but i had to give up eventually. am i missing something, or would it be possible for you to try to make an example with vue? if you tried the basic webpack template via the vue cli https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli with your plugin, i think you'd see what i'm getting at. : a simple example would be really helpful. thanks in advance.
