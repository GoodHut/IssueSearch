 URL : "https://github.com/Wikodit/js-data-jsonapi-light/issues/32" TITLE : hypen cased attributes BODY : hi, nice work! i was looking for this adapter for a long time : the json/rest api specification http://jsonapi.org/ also supports hyphen-cased key in the attributes field. my api delivers hyphen-cased attributes keys and i have a tough time getting this running. i tried to write a beforedeserialize method, but due to the included field, there can be many attributes fields deep nested anywhere in the response. so it's hard to convert them all. do you have an idea how to solve this? is there a method which is called for each attribute, which i could overload or something? however a configuration flag for this would be awesome. thanks for your time!
