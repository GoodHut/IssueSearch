 URL : "https://github.com/qvacua/vimr/issues/431" TITLE : crash at end of line BODY : with vimr latest snapshot-183 and nvim 0.2.0-dev , when i type up to the right margin where the minimized markdown/html tabs are , vimr crashes with the stack attached. this occurs at seemingly any window size, regardless whether i started from spotlight or from within a terminal using the vimr command. if i remove my ~/.config/nvim folder, this does not occur. i tracked the problem down to the following plugin: plug 'yggdroot/indentline' let g:indentline_char = 'Â»' when that's removed, the crash doesn't occur. using this plugin with nvim in a terminal is fine. the circumstances are a bit strange -- that plugin should only add the indent char for indented lines, not wrapped ones. vimr-crash.txt https://github.com/qvacua/vimr/files/970468/vimr-crash.txt
