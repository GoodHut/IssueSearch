 URL : "https://github.com/middleman/middleman/issues/2129" TITLE : make the build green BODY : this issue is to track the job of making the build green again. currently, the builds are failing in travis ci across the board: https://travis-ci.org/middleman/middleman as of right now, it's not possible to verify whether new features are bug or regression free since the results get lost in the noise of the standing failure. we need to fix this so that we can start accepting new features and releasing again.
