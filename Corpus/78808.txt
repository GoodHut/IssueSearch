 URL : "https://github.com/ximion/appstream/issues/154" TITLE : release urls in appdata? BODY : i am currently looking to replace the backend data for kde's application overview pages. they are fairly store-ish in their nature. ! screenshot_20171218_131928 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/809987/34105816-165d18ce-e3f6-11e7-9ed8-2e02a8ecd17c.png one thing i always find annoyingly missing though is a display of released artifacts source/possible binaries . when i go to such a page i rather expect some quick way to access the latest released binary so i can give it a whirl. seeing as the appdata already has a releases definition i was wondering if it would make sense to extend it with the ability to specify artifact urls with a localizable description string. something like ​ <releases> ​ <release version= 3.12.2 date= 2013-04-12 > ​ <description> ​ <p>fixes issues x, y and z</p> ​ </description> <artifacts> <artifact> <description>windows binary</description> <url>https://foo.com/yo-3.12.2.exe</url> </artifact> </artifacts> ​ </release> ​ </releases> + maybe a checksum? this would make it easier to render generic software store websites like fosshub based on appdata.
