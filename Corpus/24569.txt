 URL : "https://github.com/grommet/grommet-cli/issues/19" TITLE : support webpack v2 BODY : hi folks, just saw the following notice on http://webpack.github.io/docs/: > webpack v1 is deprecated. we encourage all developers to upgrade to webpack 2. since i'm using grommet-toolbox don't know if this project is dead, so i'm reporting here instead for building my grommet app, it would be very cool to have support for webpack v2. thx, h
