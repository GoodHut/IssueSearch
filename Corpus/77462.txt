 URL : "https://github.com/luigirizzo/netmap/issues/372" TITLE : netmap in interrupt mode BODY : hi, the netmap uses polling instead of the interrupt mechanism to notify the packet arrivals, its understand that it helps in fast packet processing and for optimizing the performance. but do we have option in netmap for using interrupt mechanism instead of default netmap polling mechanism. are netmap_bdg_polling_off and netmap_bdg_polling_on meant for this? thanks and regards, murali
