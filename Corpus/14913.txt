 URL : "https://github.com/YorickPeterse/oga/issues/175" TITLE : children of nodes BODY : hi, i have problem parsing xml document created from xlsx spreadsheet. i am using pullparser and using something like node.is_a? oga::xml::element && node.name == 'row' to determine row elements, but it has no children element which it does/shows when doing same thing in nokogiri . also, i attempted to just write text value from each cell simply node.text , but it only shows some integers. file should be fine, with nokogiri similiar code is working, i want to use/try oga because i suspect memory leaking / inefficiency in nokogiri and i need to process xlsx spreadsheets with sheets with 50k+ rows. my code looks like: handle = file.open path,'rb' parser = oga::xml::pullparser.new handle parser.parse do |node| next unless node.is_a? oga::xml::element && node.name == 'row' puts node.children.empty? end is this a bug? or am i doing something wrong? advice much appreciated!
