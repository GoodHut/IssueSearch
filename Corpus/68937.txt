 URL : "https://github.com/clawpack/riemann_book/issues/23" TITLE : some tips from fernando BODY : some notes from discussion with @fperez yesterday... 1. we should take a look at https://github.com/takluyver/bookbook regarding cross referencing between notebooks. 1. regarding https://github.com/ipython/ipywidgets/issues/1085, this seems to be fixed in the latest master branch... but: it only shows the widgets and lets you move them, it doesn't embed the results in the notebook like the old staticwidgets, so you won't see the plots change. so not really what we want. 1. if we use widgets and want the pdf version to show the plots with a specific setting, we could initialize them using value = in creating the widgets. for more control, e.g. to set different values for the pdf than what we want to initialize them to in the notebook, we could add info to the cell metadata and then modify nbconvert to parse this. 1. several examples of notebooks in journal publications can be found at: - https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/a-gallery-of-interesting-jupyter-notebooks reproducible-academic-publications - http://www.nature.com/news/ipython-interactive-demo-7.21492 1. perhaps not relevant for this book project, but some interesting new projects for rendering and manipulating 3d plots in a notebook: - https://github.com/jovyan/pythreejs - https://github.com/maartenbreddels/ipyvolume and it's possible to manipulate with a game controller: - https://github.com/ipython/ipywidgets/blob/master/docs/source/examples/controller.ipynb
