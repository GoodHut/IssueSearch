 URL : "https://github.com/lausser/check_sap_health/issues/6" TITLE : no mtes output. BODY : we would like to know if it is possible for a sap check using the check_sap_health plugin that queries the ccms to consider the no mtes output as an ok state and not as an unknown state. indeed, the nodes in the ccms tend to disappear punctually and from time to time the check returns a bad return while the node exists. this is why we would like this condition to generate no anomaly.
