 URL : "https://github.com/pivotal-cf/ulimit-release/issues/2" TITLE : consume as remote release BODY : i would like to consume this release remotely. would you be willing to add sha1 & tgz to the github release, similar to https://github.com/emalm/tmux-boshrelease/releases/tag/v0.2.0 or https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server-boshrelease/releases/tag/v0.9.0 ? publishing to bosh.io would help with discoverability, but it's not as important as the first point.
