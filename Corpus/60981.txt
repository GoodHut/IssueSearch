 URL : "https://github.com/Chalarangelo/mini.css/issues/91" TITLE : add ssl to minicss.org/ BODY : not sure where to file this, but using let's encrypt and their bot makes it pretty easy to set up ssl certs and renewal. although i saw in the site's headers that github.com was the server, so is this a form of github pages? if the docs site was a github.io site like this one chalarangelo.github.io , it would get ssl for free, managed by github, then the docs sites could be its own separate github repo too. just a thought - feel free to close.
