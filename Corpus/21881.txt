 URL : "https://github.com/OpenSource-EBike-firmware/BMSBattery_S_controllers_firmware/issues/3" TITLE : hex2bin vs objcopy BODY : the current makefile uses hex2bin, which does not seem to be a very common utility e.g. there is apparently no debian package for it . this makes it a little bit harder for people to compile the firmware. how about using objcopy which i part of gnu binutils, and thus easily available on typical gnu/linux systems instead? objcopy --input-target=ihex --output-target=binary file.ihx file.bin should do for converting intel hex to binary. or use makebin, which is included in sdcc and thus no extra effort to get, since sdcc is needed to compile the firmware anyway ? since a lot of software e.g. stm8flash can handle .ihx files directly, it might even make sense to use the .ihx file as final output. philipp
