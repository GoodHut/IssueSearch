 URL : "https://github.com/ResEnv/chain-api/issues/86" TITLE : update django version BODY : we're quite behind the times in terms of django releases, currently running 1.6. this page https://www.djangoproject.com/download/ has a nice diagram of release versions and their support horizons, and it seems like at this time the best thing to do would be to upgrade to 1.11, which hopefully should be largely compatible with 1.6 and is a long-term-support release.
