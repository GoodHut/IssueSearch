 URL : "https://github.com/trufont/trufont/issues/378" TITLE : context view tasks BODY : - draw all backgrounds drawglyphbackground, drawbackground , then all foregrounds - replace drawingtoolregistered/unregistered with adddrawingtool/setdrawingtools +insert? and drawingtoolschanged notification - add clipboard support and selection in text tool - originforindex .. is not very useful considering drawing is done in canvas coordinates, remove it? - rename glyphview notifications to canvas ? - make sure text tool works with non-default layers - maybe not hide stack widget widget, just disable the tool before setparent - add centeron/ensurevisible to context view, and - scroll caret into view - ctrl+shift and move seems impaired - have unencoded glyphs as '/foo ' in the tab title, maintain an input string in text tool and have text tool fire the names changed signal with its string - use advancewidth/height in glyphrecord to store default layer widget and not have to hunt for it everytime it's needed layoutengine does that already
