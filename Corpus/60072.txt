 URL : "https://github.com/node-red/node-red/issues/1290" TITLE : websocket node anomaly BODY : it says on the info panel for the ws output node: if the message arriving at this node started at a websocket in node, the message will be sent back to the client that triggered the flow. otherwise, the message will be broadcast to all connected clients. that's fine if the ws output has the same path as the input node, but if the message comes in on one ws path and the result of the flow is that a command is sent out to a different ws path, then nothing gets sent. a workaround is to do what we do with flows that start and end with wiotp nodes and have a msg = {payload: msg.payload}; function node to clear out the accompanying context. but i'd rather it worked as expected :
