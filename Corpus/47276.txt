 URL : "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-patreon/issues/11" TITLE : optimize webhook sync BODY : the webhook endpoint in the discourse doesn’t really make use of the webhook data, which just enqueues a new sync job. this is fine for very small patron pages, but i have a few thousand patrons, so the sync takes almost half a minute, which means that many patrons that go directly to the forum and log in will not have their permissions because the sync job is so slow and have not completed. it would be great if the sync job made use of the data it gets from the webhook to optimise a little bit so that it doesn’t have to run a full sync.
