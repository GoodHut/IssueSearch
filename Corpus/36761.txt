 URL : "https://github.com/ficlatte/main/issues/1" TITLE : import ficly stories BODY : my current thinking on this is to import the raw story html and just present that from the database. i have a copy of the entire ficly site on my disc at home, so the data is easily available. for ficly uids, i thought that it should be possible to create user records using ficlatté_uid = -ficly_uid. if a ficlatté user wishes to claim the stories of a ficly uid, there are two possible ways forward: 1. make a link between the two uids; 2. change the uids on the ficly stories to match the ficlatté user. 1. is easily reversible 2. doesn't need any more coding to display correct authorship another thing that might work is to add a ficly_uid field to the story table, which allows the old stories to retain their historical authorship but also allow them to be claimed by the ficlatté user. in any case, making the link between old uids and new uids should be an admin task, we shouldn't allow any random new user to claim authorship of a whole canon of ficly stories. thoughts?
