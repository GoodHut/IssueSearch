 URL : "https://github.com/laravel-zero/laravel-zero/issues/96" TITLE : rfc: platform detection BODY : an action's definition may depend on the platform. for example, issue 95 launches a browser window and must know the platform / operating system. laravel zero might require a package for this or offer something simpler as, in theory, this is not overly complicated. native laravel has a windows_os helper but nothing for darwin or linux detection. some actions must differentiate macos and linux such as the aforementioned browser launching tool. possible packages include: tivie\os\detector https://github.com/tivie/php-os-detector know of others? have general thoughts on the matter?
