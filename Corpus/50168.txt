 URL : "https://github.com/jrainlau/vue-flatpickr/issues/21" TITLE : webpack loading issue BODY : with the latest update which refactored the code to import vue-flatpickr-base from the default file, webpack is now giving me a resolution error: module not found: error: can't resolve './vue-flatpickr-base' in '/.../node_modules/vue-flatpickr' i'm not sure if this is specific to vue-flatpickr as i can manually patch it by adding in the .vue extension in the import path. any tips or suggestions on what i can configure on webpack to make this work would be appreciated.
