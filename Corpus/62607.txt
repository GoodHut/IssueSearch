 URL : "https://github.com/adonisjs/adonis-framework/issues/434" TITLE : controller and timeouts BODY : hi, i have a controller for an ajax request that takes a long time to process and return to the browser. what i am observing is that, before the controller has a chance to end, the ajax request fails with 'net::err_empty_response' on the client jquery client-side . now, i originally thought this was an issue with timeouts client-side, but i have increased that and i still get this empty response. might it be that adonis is imposing a server-side maximum limit on requests after which it simply fails and returns an empty answer which would explain the error message as jquery cannot parse that as json . cheers, donato
