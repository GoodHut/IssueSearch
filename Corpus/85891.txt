 URL : "https://github.com/LLK/scratch-www/issues/1742" TITLE : full screen blurs sprites BODY : expected behavior full screen should show sprites with the same sharpness especially vector sprites like the scratch cat . actual behavior if you look closely, in full screen the scratch cat is blurred. steps to reproduce 1. open https://llk.github.io/scratch-gui/develop since full screen hasn't been pushed into master yet 2. look at the scratch cat 3. go into full screen 4. look at the cat again - it's bigger, but blurred operating system and browser probably irrelevant
