 URL : "https://github.com/elixir-lang/gettext/issues/147" TITLE : global gettext context BODY : as per the discussion at: https://elixirforum.com/t/gettext-in-a-hex-package/3447/6 > maybe there should be some kind of get global instance call that everything hooks in to by default perhaps even namespaced based on the application name ? that'd still leave a way for specific instances as well but everything by default would share a global potentially namespaced translations instance? and recommended initial-thought implementation via @josevalim: > that's a good call. we could have a gettext.locale/0 and gettext.locale/1 that would use gettext own's app environment and we could make all default backends use it by default. can someone please open up an issue?
