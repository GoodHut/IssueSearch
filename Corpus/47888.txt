 URL : "https://github.com/Minehut/Issues/issues/132" TITLE : quick server restarts BODY : since the reload command was removed, users have been a bit annoyed that they have to restart their server each time they install a plugin for example because of how long it can take to load sometimes. to fix this, a quick restart system that just stops and starts your server without having to re-download it should be added. this could probably be done by using a custom /restart command overriding the default one since i don't think it properly shuts down the server which would stop the server sends you to the lobby , then automatically starts your server using the same docker container. doing this would add a great feature while also fixing the problem at the same time.
