 URL : "https://github.com/ft99/ORIE4741/issues/14" TITLE : final report peer review BODY : the project aims to predict whether or not a spotify user will like a song given the user’s history. the team was concise and included insightful visualizations across different sections. they first performed a variety of models and techniques that we discussed in class. throughout the report they also explained why particular models were chosen and also included reasoning with performance measures. i particularly liked the section of the performance metric breakdown section 4 . the team has put a lot of thought into how to expand their project and take it one step further with creative next steps. organizationally, it would have been nice to see a tabulated summary of all models and results for direct comparison. the abstract of the report noted that the prediction is based off of two things; song characteristics and the user’s history. while reading through the report i was a little confused on how the user’s history fit in with the model since most of the data descriptions and visualizations were about song characteristics. overall, great work! - artina
