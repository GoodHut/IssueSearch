 URL : "https://github.com/Michael-F-Bryan/gcode-rs/issues/17" TITLE : use bytes instead of char BODY : at the moment, the only reason the lexer wants a stream of char is because i use a lot of simple string-y methods e.g. to_upper and is_digit . there are probably some pretty decent speed improvements to be had if we were to accept a stream of bytes instead. it also makes things more convenient when you're working with files and serial connections.
