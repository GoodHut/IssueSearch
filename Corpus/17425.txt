 URL : "https://github.com/trueos/lumina/issues/398" TITLE : pdf viewer issues BODY : couple of issues from allan at asiabsdcon: 'backspace' key should move slides back, not exit esc does that when viewing 16x9 aspect ratio slides on a 4:3 monitor, it chops off the sides to make it fix. it should scale down. also, seems very slow to render the next slide, probably need to cache the rendered image somehow for x number of slides ahead and behind if not all
