 URL : "https://github.com/haskell/rfcs/issues/15" TITLE : has haskell 2020 stalled? BODY : i'd love to see this be successful, but it seems it has stalled. have the contributors lost interest? is there a part of the committee process that is broken, preventing prs from never advancing past discussion? are meetings happening without notes being posted for transparency and public consumption? if this process has not stalled it would be lovely to get an update from the team. thanks for all the hard work!
