 URL : "https://github.com/Eufranio/MagiBridge/issues/40" TITLE : enhancement for commands BODY : it would be nice if there was an option to disable the feature that deletes the !cmd and !online messages, as well as an option to customize how long, in seconds, it takes for these messages to be deleted. also, i think the !online and !cmd responses should be deleted as well, if this feature is enabled. :
