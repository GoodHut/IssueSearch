 URL : "https://github.com/fruho/fruhoapp/issues/14" TITLE : it worked only once BODY : hey, thanks for the client, it let me finally connect to my vpn. i had a .ovpn file, imported that, everything worked. i am on linux mint cinnamon 18.1 a clean install - and network manager did not accept my config file. but the issue is, after i restarted my computer, fruho did not start anymore. no error message, it just did not start. there was an active process at /etc/sbin... - i killed that and tried to restart again, but without success. so i used the software manager to deinstall it. the deinstallation was hanging at 75%. installing it again does not lead to a a working version anymore. sorry about this kinda-unspecifc error report.
