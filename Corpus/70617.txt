 URL : "https://github.com/futtta/autoptimize/issues/97" TITLE : woff / tff files on cdn BODY : i installed autoptimize on my wp install where i also have wp super cache active. i've set up azure to host a cdn but the cheaper version unfortunately does not come with custom domain names, so i have a cors issue there. i fixed some of the issues by using the latest version from this repo, but for some reason it's still trying to load two of the files from the cdn and i suspect that autoptimize is the cause of this. in general i'd love some guidance on how to combine the two. both wp super cache and autoptimize have cdn settings which i now both have enabled. should i use only one of two? also i like the option for wp super cache where you can configure extensions the plugin should ignore for cdn so that they're always loaded from the host itself. i've set that to exclude ttf and woff, but since those are still being loaded i suspect autoptimize is putting them somewhere earlier in the pipeline. any info would be appreciated :
