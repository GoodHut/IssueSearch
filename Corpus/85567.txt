 URL : "https://github.com/lcnetdev/marc2bibframe2/issues/58" TITLE : field 306 and bf:duration BODY : the semantics of field 306 playing time can cause problems. everything is fine when 306 contains a single value for the duration of the instance as a whole. there is a problem, however, when the instance contains two or more pieces, in which case field 306 contains multiple values, one for each part. take this example: bf:duration 000213 , 000215 , 000312 , 000344 , 000347 , 000354 , 000739 , 000830 , 003121 ; bf:extent a bf:extent ; rdfs:label 1 audio disc 70 min., 30 sec. . this linked data makes the nonsensical assertion that the instance has nine separate and different durations. in fact, it has one duration, 70 minutes and 30 seconds. the durations of parts logically belong in instances for these parts, which are not generated in the conversion. i suggest that when field 306 has multiple values, bf:duration not be generated. alternately, you could create a new property, bf:durationofpart, that would give the proper meaning to the values.
