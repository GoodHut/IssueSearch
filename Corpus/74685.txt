 URL : "https://github.com/tablacus/TablacusExplorer/issues/93" TITLE : feature open in same tab BODY : hi there, current - open folder on the treeview opens in _a new tab._ - open folder on the horizontal favourites bar opens in _a new tab_ - open folder by double click in the content pane opens in _a new tab_ wanted - by default the current tab should change its content to the new place, instead of opening a new tab. - a new tab shall only be opened if explicitly asked - on the treeview and content pane by right click in context menu or middle mouse button that is already possible - on the favourites bar the same way by an context menu and/or using middle mouse button i've seen that middle mouse button does that already thanks and regards antonio
