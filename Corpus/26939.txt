 URL : "https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/issues/2514" TITLE : changing dot colors BODY : question: what is the best way to override the default color styles of the navigation dots with javascript? the expected behavior with this snippet is that on panels with the anchor of intro, the dots will change from their default grey color to white. but this only seems to work when i type it into the console after the page has loaded. if window.location.href.indexof intro > -1 { $ fp-nav .find span .css background , fff ; }
