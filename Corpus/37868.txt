 URL : "https://github.com/idekerlab/cy-ndex-2/issues/9" TITLE : ndex id not visible? BODY : if i want to have a labmate load the same network i loaded, or i want to load a network they tell me about, i think an ndex id needs to be available. so far, i don't see a way to get it from the ndex dialogs or table information. this is critical.
