 URL : "https://github.com/fabric8io/vertx-maven-plugin/issues/80" TITLE : printout config info BODY : it will be nice if we can add a feature to the plugin which can print out runtime configuration info when needed, like how springboot does during mvn spring-boot:run -ddebug . though we cant extract all the details but worth throwing details where possible. e.g. httpclient/server options
