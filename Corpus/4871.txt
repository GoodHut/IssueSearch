 URL : "https://github.com/KepecsLab/Bpod/issues/12" TITLE : hover text tip BODY : sometimes it would be useful to have a short tip on how to use a given bpod parameter show up in the form of a small text box that appears when the mouse pointer hovers over that parameter. matlab implements that via the tooltipstring property of gui elements see link http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/uitoggletool.html?searchhighlight=tooltipstring&s_tid=doc_srchtitle . shouldn't be too hard to implement in bpod.
