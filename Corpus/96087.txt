 URL : "https://github.com/BlackToppStudios/Mezzanine/issues/159" TITLE : ecs - consolidate managers BODY : currently, the worldobject/worldentity classes have a manager for each type actormanger, debrismanager, etc. . this doesn't really offer us much and forces us to add more information to apis for serialization and other functionality so they can navigate to the correct manager. we can cut back substantially on code in the engine and potentially get some more control over how updates are performed based on how many of each type by having them in one place as a singular manager . this also reduces boilerplate and maybe more as more worldobject/worldentity types are added in the future. in the short term, or maybe longer, we can keep the unique work units per worldobject/worldentity type as we have already. this is 6. in 134 .
