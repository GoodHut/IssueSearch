 URL : "https://github.com/richardjdare/bb2-mode/issues/1" TITLE : fix issues with data$ BODY : $ doesn't work nicely when its used as part of a data statement ie: data.b 1,2,3 data$ a string because $ is of syntax type w it is considered part of the preceding data statement, which then fails to trigger the keyword highlighting. if i change the syntax type to ' it works but then breaks keywords with $ in such as inkey$, because emacs no longer considers $ to be part of a word. for now, i have added a keyword data$ which is better than nothing, but really the $ in data$ should be a type.
