BODY : hi all, firstly i'd like to thank users @macfly1202 , @sebastianv650 and @bubnikv for their help on my topic just upgraded to mm head and cannot get a good quality print. i was really busy with work so couldn't get back to you guys straight away however i did a factory reset uninstalled and re-installed all software and updated the firmware again and i started getting somewhere. it was a combination of that and i believe the pinda was not set correctly when the upgrade was originally done as i couldn't live adjust z to a satisfactory height. so i have completed a couple of successful prints since however am finding i am getting a lot of stringing. it wasn't to bad on the treefrog and it could easily be cleaned up, however i printed 3 small parts this morning and the stringing is really over the top. i was wondering if this is caused by my nozzle height or something else? i have included a photo to show how over the top the stringing is. thanks again. ! 20171121_094433 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32886842/33046086-9590dba2-cea3-11e7-9d0c-898d9584a16b.jpg
