 URL : "https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues/5289" TITLE : handling null in rxjava2 BODY : i am migrating from rxjava1.x to rxjava2. i have to handle null in many scenarios because previously rxjava1.x was supporting observable<void> which accepted null. here is the scenario: public completable updatepatient final patient patient { return completable.fromcallable -> update patient ; } private static void update patient patient throws httpexception, nonetworkexception, jsonexception, ioexception { ...code to update patient return null; } as seen from above example, the updatepatient does not return any value. hence completable is used to indicate oncomplete or onerror only. i want this null to be removed following rxjava2 conventions. plz help
