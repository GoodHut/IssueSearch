 URL : "https://github.com/bloomberg/bucklescript/issues/1476" TITLE : bug dead code elimination BODY : here is a case of complex scenario: run_main/7422 is not eliminated which will fail our sanitizer, the code should still work if we get rid of our sanitizer since for unused code it is okay to have undefined reference run_main/7422 <-- as_mapper ast_mapper <-- nothing run_main/7422 <-- register_function register_function <-- ast_mapper register_function <-- register register <-- nothing however, here register_funciton is not eliminated since it is a reference, it calls run_main which fails our sanitizer
