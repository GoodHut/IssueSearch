 URL : "https://github.com/bsutherland/JuceOPLVSTi/issues/59" TITLE : planned ui improvements BODY : > i'll be revisiting the ui again in the future, and like last time i'll make sure to do the reorganizations myself to spare you the effort. key areas to address at some later date: > > moving the location of feedback entirely. > typography, color, pixel perfect ui @gdreyband hope you don't mind if i keep track of this here. about typography and color, please let me know what you had in mind! - color: personally i'd like to stick with the monochrome theme because it keeps things simple for me as a non-ui guy, and i think it suits the theme , but i'm open to suggestions - pixel perfect: i guess you mean reworking the high-res bits to look more low-res like the waveform icons? if so, i'm definitely on board with that! - typography: yes, from the beginning i wanted to use the font from the dos game syndicate, but i couldn't find an existing font conversion of it and there were bigger priorities at the time looking forward to seeing what you have in mind!
