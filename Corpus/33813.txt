 URL : "https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kpi/issues/1329" TITLE : ashley maher support BODY : we're looking to install multiple kobotoolbox instances on a single server as we expect that we will have multiple clients who will want their own version of kobotoolbox. we would also like to separate the database containers and have them running on a dedicated database server. it is expected that the clients will want this to run in a clustered environment, as such the cost of separate servers for each instance of kobotoolbox will be very significant. we have followed the installation instructions of the kobo-docker repo and found that easy to implement and work with, however attempting to create a second instance of kobotoolbox on the same server causes the nginx containers to have a port conflict. we have not yet looked into using an external database for a kobotoolbox install, though it seems that the connection strings in the kobocat.txt file under envfiles might be the way to go. we were wondering if you could provide some instruction on: 1 hosting multiple kobotoolbox installs on a single node in a clustered environment. 2 hosting the databases on a separate server. 3 have you had a client with this kind of high availability architectural mindset? how would you handle that?
