 URL : "https://github.com/myint/pyflakes-test-again/issues/14" TITLE : dead code after a return BODY : is there a reason pyflakes doesn't warn on dead code , i.e., code that cannot possibly be run because it comes after a return or a raise in the same block, like def f : return g cannot be reached i think return, raise, break, and continue are all such statements. in a similar vein should this be a separate issue? , what about unnecessary pass, like if x: pass f inline non-string literals or bare variable names might also fit into this category, although the latter can be a useful way to squash incorrect unused variable warnings.
