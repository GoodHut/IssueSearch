 URL : "https://github.com/GoogleChrome/workbox/issues/759" TITLE : workbox-build api changes BODY : cc @jeffposnick @goldhand during the last meeting, the idea of changing of the workbox-build api came up. i believe this is around some of the api's being confusing to developer, i.e. when and how to use one or the other and then there is the topic of sharing some of the logic in workbox-build that isn't currently available this might be making some of the api's public or just ensuring the internal logic can be shared with the webpack plugin . things that have been mentioned a few time or were discussed during our meeting: 1. one change that has been requested a few times is adding the ability to define a regex for the injectmanifest point. 1. webpack can generate it's own manifest 1. will this help us to work with webpack server? 1. will we be able to have the same filtering of files of certain size? glob pattern etc? 1. the runtime caching could be extracted to a seperate internal file that webpack could use @jeffposnick did you have any additional ideas?
