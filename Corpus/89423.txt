 URL : "https://github.com/solus-project/ferryd/issues/8" TITLE : pullrepo should not delta BODY : if we do a pull that results in 320 jobs, and average each sync job as ~11s, this is an hour added for no reason. sure, it might not always index because deltas existing or not needed, but still, optimise it. just swap it out for a deltajob and then we can manually index it once status shows it done. marking it here so i don't actually forget..
