 URL : "https://github.com/tomSny/XStarLogViewer/issues/3" TITLE : can't get a complete build BODY : using vs 2015 with git plugin. i did a clon of the current master. i had to guess at a lot of references for plugin. it may be circular the way i have it but it appears to get rid of the reference issues. the problem is now where there is a class property missing for a bunch of classes. srtm.getaltitude is the method call. what library or project should be used? look in the elevationprofile.cs file line 178. i usually work with web applications, but am not afraid of learning. thank you for your time, mark
