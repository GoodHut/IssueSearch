 URL : "https://github.com/minecraft-dev/MinecraftDev/issues/180" TITLE : spongeapi 6 not detected BODY : unsure if this is an issue with sbt or not don't think so as it should just look at the dependecies . i have a project with 4 subprojects. one shared, and one for 4.1.0, one for 5.0.0, and one for the snapshot branch of 6.0.0. the first three projects are recognized, but not the last one, despite the fact that it uses the spongeapi, is not.
