 URL : "https://github.com/cgrates/cgrates/issues/803" TITLE : export cdrlog type cdr BODY : hello dear cgrates team! we try to export cdrs that were produced by execution of action having cdrlog action type. no matter which filter we use, they are not exported. cdrs that are produced by processcdr api are exported ok. the cdrlog does not go through online exports only query-able cdrs since the cdr is dumped directly into stordb . please correct, thanks, michael
