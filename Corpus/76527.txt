BODY : i see a todo for handle trickle ice candidates here https://github.com/chadnickbok/librtcdcpp/blob/5ce7ac1cc7dd6aa61560576ee6fbd7542001ea54/include/rtcdcpp/peerconnection.hpp l96 . but there are two apis, one that supports handling trickle ice candidates and the other for setting the initial candidates. bool setremoteicecandidate and bool setremoteicecandidates . is this todo about unifying the functionality into a single api or is it just a left over comment? if it's the latter case, do you think we have more of these left over comments lying around that needs clean up?
