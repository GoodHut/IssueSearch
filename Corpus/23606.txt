 URL : "https://github.com/lemonstand/omnipay-elavon/issues/11" TITLE : pull request issue BODY : i created a pull request that had a couple psr standard issues. i fixed those issues but when i pushed up the changes, the tests on travis did not run. i asked this question in the pr but i am not getting a response so i thought i would create an issue in hopes that someone sees this. i have only worked with repos that used travis a couple times but when i have, the tests ran automatically whenever i pushed up a change. is there something that i need to do here to get them to run again? if not, could you take a look at it and see what needs to be done with the pr? thanks!!
