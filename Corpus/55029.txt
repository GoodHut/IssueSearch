 URL : "https://github.com/geocollections/geokogud2/issues/32" TITLE : ids not coming through BODY : i am comparing every link to original geokogud.info. on preparation detail view: - locality id - stratigraphy id on stratigraphy search and detail view: - age id - belongs to id on locality search view: - stratigraphy base id exists in api if you give the field=stratigraphy_base_id - stratigraphy top id exists in api if you give the field=stratigraphy_top_id edit: back-end return both these values, needs investigation why front-end won't return them. on locality detail view - parent locality id there are some other missing ids also. i suppose those ids exist but api just isn't giving them out.
