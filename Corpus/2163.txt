 URL : "https://github.com/Zmiecer/CompoundRNN/issues/3" TITLE : tidy up code BODY : please merge in 2 and do the following: use meaningful variable names instead of one-letter ones; remove dubious leftover comments; ensure you pass pep8 recommendations maybe with a relaxed line length restriction ; improve modular structure of the project e.g. smash is not a part of model.py in my opinion .
