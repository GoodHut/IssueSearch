 URL : "https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/website/issues/38" TITLE : bitcoin cash history BODY : there is this nice list of events in bitcoin cash: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7dtbew/bitcoin_cash_a_reflection_on_how_far_weve_come/ it would be a nice addition to the site as some history section somewhere. the author is willing to provide all the proof-links if this list gets accepted, and i am willing to throw $20 to him and $30 to whoever formats it into a pull request. what do you think? should this be added?
