 URL : "https://github.com/stuartlangridge/ColourPicker/issues/28" TITLE : blurry zoom in the preview BODY : the line \_\_main__.py l1014 https://github.com/stuartlangridge/colourpicker/blob/app/pick/__main__.py l1014 causes everything to be blurry, even though the preview was upscaled before with gdkpixbuf.interptype.nearest . fun fact: this is getting even worse on hidpi screens, as the cursor is then scaled up again.
