 URL : "https://github.com/thestonefox/VRTK/issues/1160" TITLE : multiple snap drop zones BODY : environment vrtk version 3.1.0 unity 5.6.0f3 simulator steps to reproduce create multiple objects with snap drop zones defined and make them close or overlapping each other expected behavior only one drop zone should be highlighted, perhaps the one with shortest absolute distance to the grabbed object's pivot? of course you can always have small drop zones, but you can argue that if you are grabbing a large object that will still trigger multiple drop zones. or i cant see any use cases for this though you can checkbox whether you want multiple highlighted or not. current behavior multiple possible drop zones are being highlighted and as a user you don't know where your object will go.
