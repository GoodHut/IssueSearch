 URL : "https://github.com/dustinblackman/Championify/issues/302" TITLE : won't load league BODY : i downloaded the newest version of both championify and lol. championify will open and let me select what sets i want, but when i click launch league, it does nothing. championify goes away, but lol does not load. when i open lol, there are no sets of items showing. i have downloaded/uninstalled/installed twice with no success. i attempted to look for the log files for championify to load here but i can't find them on my pc. i have windows 10 . not sure what else you would need.
