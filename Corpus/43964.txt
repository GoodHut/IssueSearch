BODY : hi, i'm having an issue. trying to get this to work on my mac first before deploying to a windows server. i've setup a test using composer. trying to get a simple list of properties. running in a terminal. i get the first response, dumping the object before its passed. but the 2nd response from the call doesn't return anything. no errors either? any help would be greatly appreciated. thanks, jamie
