 URL : "https://github.com/lucienraeg/4D-Connect-Four/issues/2" TITLE : potential balance issue BODY : the current 7x7x7x7 shape of the board sets up the play to be exactly like 2d connect four. a new shape is going to be necessary to utilise the inter-dimensional gameplay which makes the game so wonderful. alternate or accompanying change could also be changing the amount of pieces that need to be connected. this would require a variable that could be changed, calling for some changes in some code to make it more dynamic for this like the line mentioned in 1 another possibility could be having to achieve a certain number of 'connects' making the game a first-to-x kind of game. could be cool.
