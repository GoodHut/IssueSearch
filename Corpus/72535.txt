BODY : dear all, i am trying to upgrade the can fw update on icub 2.5 eth base . i am able to connect to see can 1 and can 2. however i am not sure where to find the fw for each one one of can 1 and 2. i have updated can1 with the ems.hex. and i got the following: debug bus:id type version debug can1:4 8 2.1.-1 debug can1:1 8 2.1.-1 debug can1:2 8 2.1.-1 debug can1:3 8 2.1.-1 debug can2:13 6 3.0.4 however the version is lower. i think the type is now correct, but i lost the s/n of strain and it now says protocol n/a. therefore, i may be using the wrong fw version. should i use mcp2plus and/or mcp4plus? if so what file is to be downloaded to can1 and can2? many thanks in advance. pedro
