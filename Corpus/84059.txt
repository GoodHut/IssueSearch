 URL : "https://github.com/zeit/hyper/issues/2199" TITLE : copy/paste directory path BODY : - os version and name : 10.12.5 - macos sierra - hyper.app version : 1.4.3 issue in iterm2 i am able to copy a directory and paste into iterm2 to get the full path. this does not seem to work in hyper. but if i drag a directory into hyper i do get the full path. would be nice if copy/paste worked - getting the path that way is faster for me.
