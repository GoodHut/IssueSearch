 URL : "https://github.com/BioJulia/Bio.jl/issues/467" TITLE : test on bio.var BODY : i found a very large block of tests is inside a comment in test/var/runtest.jl https://github.com/biojulia/bio.jl/blob/6ec0fb21c992388190ff0bc5b84f04e41789b863/test/var/runtests.jl l35-l270 . as a result, nothing is tested except bcf and vcf tools. i don't think this is a good situation. so, @ward9250, could you write some tests on this code?
