BODY : today i started the worm holes quest and i haven't been able to complete it. when i go to the end of the east cave to press the button i need to press to continue the quest it says, you don't have permission for this area, in bold, red text. the same thing happened yesterday when i tried opening loot chests on my journey and it said the same thing. i've relogged several times and it still says, you don't have permission for this area, in bold, red text. i have no idea what is going on but can someone help me fix this problem?
