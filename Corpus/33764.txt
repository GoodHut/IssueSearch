 URL : "https://github.com/mytakedotorg/mytakedotorg/issues/124" TITLE : apostrophes in title BODY : save a take with an apostrophe in the title. go to the /drafts listing and the apostrophe is in the title as expected. click this draft to open the saved take and the apostrophe is replaced with the html entity & 39; . it likely happens with other characters too. is this intended server behavior? there's no built in javascript way to decode this, but a function can be written to decode the html entities if needed. function htmldecode input { var entities= { &amp; : & , &lt; : < , &gt; : > //.... }; for var prop in entities { if entities.hasownproperty prop { input = input.replace new regexp prop, g , entities prop ; } } return input; } courtesy https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2808368/decode-html-entities-in-javascript
