 URL : "https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/issues/371" TITLE : update to api20 BODY : i haven't used crna yet, but i am interested in trying it out now that expo api20 is out with its much improved camera api. i have submitted pr 370 which i believe updates everything necessary. would be great if someone who has used crna before could test it and ensure it still works as expected.
