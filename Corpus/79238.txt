 URL : "https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop/issues/1698" TITLE : scoop status always fail BODY : the status command always gives the following output: fatal: ambiguous argument 'head..origin/': unknown revision or path not in the working tree. use '--' to separate paths from revisions, like this: 'git <command> <revision>... -- <file>... ' scoop is up to date. everything is ok! it seems scoop config scoop_branch outputs empty string, which caused the above error.
