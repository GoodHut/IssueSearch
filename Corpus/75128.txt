 URL : "https://github.com/mg6maciej/android-maps-extensions/issues/56" TITLE : geojson feature request? BODY : your clustering engine is soooo much more efficient imo than the google utilities. i was working on a project that needed a geojson overlay and noticed that this wonderful library doesn't have that baked in. is this something that is being looked at for a future release? i can explore other options for geojson polygons if not. thanks!
