 URL : "https://github.com/facontidavide/PlotJuggler/issues/46" TITLE : csv file handling BODY : first of all, thanks a lot for a great tool! so far, i have been using plotjuggler with rosbags and it has worked flawlessly. now i'm trying to use it with .csv files and i can't quite figure out how the importing works. i'm using version 1.0.4 installed from the ros kinetic apt package ros-kinetic-plotjuggler . for example, i create a .csv file in pandas using the following commands: import pandas as pd import matplotlib as plt df = pd.dataframe np.random.randn 6,4 , index= 1,2,3,4,5,6 , columns=list 'abcd' df.to_csv 'test.csv' the output is this file https://github.com/facontidavide/plotjuggler/files/1083204/test.txt the extension has been changed to .txt because github does not support attaching .csv files to issues . when loading the data into plotjuggler, i get the following warning: selected time in not strictly monotonic. do you want to abort? clicking no you continue loading when clicking no i can see the data in the left pane, however, when trying to plot the data against the index vector, i.e., right-dragging the index vector to the plot pane and then left-dragging the data columns, this is the result i get: ! plotjuggler_037 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2772996/27262342-f52c112c-5454-11e7-8556-92dafd766abf.png btw. i did maximize both the vertical and the horizontal zoom. when maximizing the vertical zoom, the following gets printed to the console from which i started plotjuggler: invalid x0/x1 range in plotwidget::maximumrangey invalid x0/x1 range in plotwidget::maximumrangey invalid x0/x1 range in plotwidget::maximumrangey invalid x0/x1 range in plotwidget::maximumrangey i expect to see this plot: ! df_plot https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2772996/27262357-39b9875c-5455-11e7-8240-0d6a2d6dbd4e.png which is what i get by: df.plot plt.show am i missing something obvious?
