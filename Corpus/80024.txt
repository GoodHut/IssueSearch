 URL : "https://github.com/her001/tmdrv/issues/7" TITLE : support thrustmaster tmx BODY : i suspect that this wheel will initialize in the same way as the thrustmaster tx, but i'll need someone with the hardware to share with me the capture data. with the usb traffic between the windows driver and the tmx as with usbpcap http://desowin.org/usbpcap , i should be able to add support to tmdrv. in this case, it will need to be tested and i will need the parameters for calibrating the device with jscal.
