 URL : "https://github.com/benchflow/benchflow/issues/131" TITLE : update rest api structure BODY : update all the rest apis so that we use the same format as on minio: /username/testname/testnumber/exprimentnumbjer/trialnumber it will be easy to extend when we need to and also it is easy to generate the path by just replacing “.” with “/“ in the testid/experimentid/trialid. see test-manager and experiment-manager for details.
