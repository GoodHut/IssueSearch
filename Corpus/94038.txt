 URL : "https://github.com/DBDU/union/issues/7" TITLE : best way to do custom bots BODY : part of the idea of this is being able to have quickly deployable bots for individual, user-sided use. thus, all cogs need to be separable excluding the base bot. this also raises the question of do we want to require users to set up a database and such? the config class we end up using could be designed such that we can use a proper database for the public bot, and perhaps json or a smaller, no-dependency database for user-sided stuff. at the same time, this means that the config class is more limited in capability.
