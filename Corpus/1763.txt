 URL : "https://github.com/Dickurt/vscode-php-formatter/issues/20" TITLE : fix on save? BODY : the docs say that this extension supports fixing a file on save, but doesn't explain how to do that. i also noticed a commit message saying the onsave command was removed. is the feature no longer available? kind of a bummer if that's the case...
