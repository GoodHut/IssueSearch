 URL : "https://github.com/plumed/plumed2/issues/306" TITLE : possible bug in ves BODY : @valsson i noticed there are scaring messages on the travis log in some of the ves tests. the test is not failing, but perhaps there is some other problem. i think the problem came out in between these two builds: https://travis-ci.org/plumed/plumed2/jobs/286450888 https://travis-ci.org/plumed/plumed2/jobs/286897299 search the log for 'rt-md_le-1d-mpi-4-replicas-diff-frictions' . can you check if this is related to the pull request we recently merged? thanks! giovanni ps in any case, we should understand why the whole suite is not reporting this as a failure...
