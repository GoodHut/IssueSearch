 URL : "https://github.com/blei-lab/edward/issues/681" TITLE : edward's api docs suck BODY : i think the api docs are amazing the first time around assuming you have time to read through many pages of text . but i don't think the api docs are useful anytime after that. ideally my use case would be: 0. i forgot the name of an argument, method, and/or am looking for a particular function. 1. i go to edwardlib.org. 2. i type in a search box the name of an class/function if i know it; alternatively, i go through the api organized in a coherent fashion. 3. when i click on a edward class/function, its docstring is displayed, is relatively clean, and detached from other classes/functions on that page. 4. from that page, i might click on other related classes/functions. this involves 3-4 clicks at most. we can't do this at the moment because we lack: + a search box + individual webpages for each class/function, and with a navigable index to click on other classes/functions + better stylized docstrings on the backend, we lack a lot of extensibility because sphinx adds cruft and is overkill for our purposes. i think we should move to what tensorflow https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/tools/docs and keras https://github.com/fchollet/keras/tree/master/docs do, which is to build our own docstring parser. for search, we should look into something like lunr.js https://lunrjs.com .
