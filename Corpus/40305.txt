 URL : "https://github.com/blueman-project/blueman/issues/716" TITLE : tracker: gdk scaling BODY : when using a scale factor of 2 gdk_scale=2 we run into a few problems like blurry icons. take for example the composite icons in the managerdevicelist. everywhere we let gtk handle icon loading they are scaled nicely but we tend to use pixbufs all over the place. the best solution would be to let gtk handle the icons whenever possible. and where we manipulate icon pixbufs use cairo surfaces which supports scaling. the only problem is that these function are not yet available in a released pycairo version, see https://github.com/pygobject/pycairo/commit/498dc027a0ab067471392e1de0e472a77453a415. i personally do not have a hidpi display so would be nice if folks who do use these displays and scale comment with issues they see. feel free to add more items below. - move away from using pixbufs in gtk widgets like menus pr 712 - use cairo surfaces to create composite icons, then use the surface directly in the cellrenderer
