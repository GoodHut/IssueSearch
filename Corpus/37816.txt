 URL : "https://github.com/allinurl/goaccess/issues/734" TITLE : multiple log sources BODY : hi guys, is there anyway to provide multiple log sources to goaccess with a log-file parameter which could looks like : log-file /var/log/ / / .log ? - - - the idea behind is to build a common directory to all my logs from host and container within 1 directory like /my/var/log in this directory i coul bind volumes like that docker run -v /my/var/log/myapp/var/log:/var/log ... docker run -v /my/var/log/myotherapp/var/log:/var/log ... docker run -v /my/var/log/anapp/var/log:/var/log ... + mkdir -p /my/var/log/host/var/log + configure app to redirect logs to that specific dir once i have done that, i can bind /my/var/log/ to goaccess container, define log-file /var/log/ / / .log and the process will take care of parsing all logs, define the proper log-format and generate report s i m not sure it meant to be like that, but that will be so awesome what do you think ?
