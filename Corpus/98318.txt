 URL : "https://github.com/CartoDB/cartodb.js/issues/1906" TITLE : install cartodb using npm? BODY : is it currently possible to install cartodb.js using npm? i found the {{@cartodb}} organization on npmjs.org, but it doesn't list cartodb.js. in the readme there's also an explanation how to install it using bower. but i'm not using bower anymore. indeed i found it more and more uncommon to use bower instead of npm over the last years. ok, i just found issue 98. and i'm not 100% sure about this, but wouldn't it be possible to use {{peerdependencies}} to overcome the {{cannot read property '...' of undefined}} errors? and is this still an issue? the issues are quite old already. if nothing has changed since back then: sorry, that i've brought up this topic again.
