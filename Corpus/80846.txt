 URL : "https://github.com/Kureev/react-native-list/issues/1" TITLE : usage of @providesmodule BODY : hey there, this is really useful for people using prior versions, but using @providesmodule makes this unusable for expo folks because rn-cli.config.js doesn't exist with expo. with expo we have to wait for them to publish a new sdk before we can use the latest rn version, so changing your code to use relative imports instead of @providesmodule would make it much easier for users to get access to flatlist+. your code is in the same directory so you don't really need that special module resolution. just throw a ./ in your requires and we all prosper. thanks for your work!
