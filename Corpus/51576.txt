 URL : "https://github.com/vjeantet/hugo-theme-docdock/issues/116" TITLE : augmenting index pages BODY : i noticed that docbook will automatically generate a summary of sub-pages if the content of _index.md is left blank. see https://drugsinmind.net/23.treatment_services/ for instance this is a really nice feature which would make sense to document a little better. i was wondering if it's also possible to retain this behaviour while inserting an introductory paragraph to the _index.md page?
