 URL : "https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/24025" TITLE : improve multi-jvm test kit BODY : the muti jvm testkit is a great feature that doesn't appear to be used much outside of our own testsing - document how all the failure modes work - provide more examples - support remote actorsystem being restarted at the moment if the client disconnects or it is removed you can't then re-enable/disable the link. this would be very useful for tests that include restating a remote actor system
