 URL : "https://github.com/voidlabs/mosaico/issues/333" TITLE : a few issues with images? BODY : hi, please bare with me as i am a beginner in coding and have no knowledge of node.js. i use windows 10. i have successfully installed run the off-line version of the mosaico yesterday node.js, grunt, imagemagik, git are all properly installed as per the instructions . i can add images to the e-mail template and they display ok in the interface. issue 1: i cannot edit the images like i do on the web version. there is no icon appearing that takes me to that menu. is it an issue with imagemagik? i have installed legacy files as instructed. issue 2: in the html code, the image urls are stored locally on my computer, like this: http://127.0.0.1:9006/img/? src=http%3a%2f%2f127.0.0.1%3a9006%2fuploads%2fcerberus%2520cover%2520photo%2520white%2520words%2520 4 .jpg&method=resize&params=534%2cnull this will not work when we launch the e-mail live. so what is the correct way to treat images? do i have to host the images myself then manually edit the code to put in the right urls? issue 3: the in-built social icons cannot be saved. http://127.0.0.1:9006/templates/versafix-1/img/social_def/facebook_bw_ok.png returns a non-sensible image. could you tell me where they are located on the c drive? thanks!
