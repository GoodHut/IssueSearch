 URL : "https://github.com/bitmovin/bitmovin-go/issues/8" TITLE : gcs authentication error BODY : i'm trying gcs and i've incorrectly set the credentials on purpose . i don't get an appropriate error message. the error returned by create is nil, and every field in the response is nil, including status. i was confused, so i checked it out and the json response it's getting is: json { message : invalid authentication credentials } ie. seems to be an unhandled case
