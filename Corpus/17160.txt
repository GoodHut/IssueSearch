 URL : "https://github.com/Gillardo/bootstrap-ui-datetime-picker/issues/178" TITLE : no cancel support BODY : the implementation modifies the model incrementally on date or time selection but doesn't provide any support for cancelling the change and reverting the model. the esc key does close the dialogs but does not revert the model. suggest a cancel button to revert the model and close the dialogs, plus revert functionality added to esc key handling?
