 URL : "https://github.com/ZeroK-RTS/Zero-K/issues/1918" TITLE : solid chat BODY : would it be possible to replace the unexpectedly appearing/disappearing chat by a solid element like the rest of the ui? pretty much the current chat, but with backlog always enabled, a darkened background and the metallic border. it could fit for example to the top left, symmetric to debug console.
