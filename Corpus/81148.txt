 URL : "https://github.com/socialappslab/appcivist-pb-client/issues/896" TITLE : voting features problems BODY : i had a quick look at it and have some minor suggestions: · wherever the points cannot be edited is it possible to remove the textbox ? for instance in “my voting summary” and on the proposal page. ideally it would be great if they are textboxes so that users can edit them anywhere but i am guessing there’s a technical constraint to saving this information. if this is the case then i would suggest not showing a textbox. a simple rectangle with just a border might work. · i am able to remove the points that i had previously saved from the proposal card but i am not able to re-renter a new number. · what happens if they don’t finalize their voting ? is it possible to automatically finalize voting at the end of the voting phase for those who have used all their distribution points? · the voting instructions keep opening when i go to a proposal page and come back. could we disable this ? maybe just show it once and then automatically disable it ? · also on the proposal page it shows me nan instead of 0 points :
