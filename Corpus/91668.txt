 URL : "https://github.com/10J/example-react-redux-site/issues/3" TITLE : uncentered main container BODY : the main container of the entire site does not seem to follow standard css nested div orientation due to the overlapping rules put in place upon it. a % value margin on each side was used, but this does not render it centered, only approximately in the ballpark of centered. this should be fixed asap.
