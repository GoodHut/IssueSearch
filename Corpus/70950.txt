 URL : "https://github.com/Door43/ulb-en/issues/485" TITLE : 2ki 10:28 added metonymy BODY : that is how jehu destroyed baal and removed its worship from israel. here baal is a metonymy for the worship of baal, yet in the translation here the worship of baal is made explicit and baal is left as well, which leads us to ask what is baal also a metonym for? that leads us to his temple. which is not necessary an incorrect interpretation if baal originally stood for a larger spread of his worship and his temple... but it seems this is not the best interpretation. perhaps go with either destroyed baal or destroyed the worship of baal --both is probably not the best option as the hebrew does not have a conj. here and two items.
