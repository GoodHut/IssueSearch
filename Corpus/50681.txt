 URL : "https://github.com/CelticMinstrel/wesnoth/issues/432" TITLE : a timer widget in gui2 BODY : original submission https://gna.org/bugs/index.php?23271 by anonymous on 2015-02-13 it would be nice to have an invisible timer widget available in wesnoth.show_dialog which could be used like this: local dialog = { ... t.timer { interval = 1000, id = timer_1 }, ... } local function on_timer end local function preshow wesnoth.set_dialog_value timer, timer_1 end wesnoth.show_dialog dialog, preshow which would mean that the function 'on_timer' is called every 1000 miliseconds every second while the dialog is open.
