 URL : "https://github.com/Ybalrid/Annwvyn/issues/90" TITLE : ogre21 scenemangers BODY : annwvyn was using the octreescenemanager plugin. it doesn't exist anymore. now instead of clever data structure , the object traversal is done by throwing more raw compute at it, because, well... hardware is different from hardware 15 years ago. re-implement the scene manager declaration code to the new one.
