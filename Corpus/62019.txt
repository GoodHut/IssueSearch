 URL : "https://github.com/imintel/mbtiles4j/issues/2" TITLE : can't get a single tile BODY : when using the mbtilesreader only provides a method to get a tile iterator. sometimes it can be useful to be able to retrieve a single tile. this is at least something i need for my project. that is why i'd like to propose a new method for the mbtilesreader . it's signature would look something like: public tile gettile int z, int x, int y ; i'll offer a pull request when i've implement this.
