 URL : "https://github.com/siteorigin/siteorigin-panels/issues/452" TITLE : database size grows huge BODY : i have only 3 pages built with siteorigin page builder, but i noticed my database size grew huge. i checked that wp_postmeta table has more than 3,000 entries with panels_data entry in meta_key and 18 mb in size. apparently, every time i preview the post with so pagebuilder, it creates new entry in wp_postmeta table with increasing post_id numbers not only the post_id of the particular post . ! capture https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3774827/28811122-f6015bdc-76ac-11e7-8b81-42feb47927ce.png
