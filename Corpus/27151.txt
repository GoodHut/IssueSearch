 URL : "https://github.com/BillyBlaze/OctoPrint-TouchUI/issues/117" TITLE : controls grayed out BODY : i have touchui running on the latest octopi with a 7in display. it all works very well except i can't delete files or initiate a print on the display. these controls are visible but grayed out on the display. i have to use my main computer to do these tasks. also, i can't cancel a print from the display. i followed the steps on the wiki to install. i have googled quite a lot for a solution to this issue and haven't found much. any ideas what might be wrong? regards, kdpainter
