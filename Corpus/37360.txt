 URL : "https://github.com/MisterDA/love-release/issues/46" TITLE : lua version agnostic BODY : as discussed in the forums, love-release script doesn't depend on the lua version itself, it would be better to target any lua version equal or greater than 5.1. this would mean: - changing the rockspec - adding lua 5.2 and lua 5.3 to the travis test matrix - chaning the luacheck --std flag to max - make lua-zip compatible with all the lua versions - ensure that the other dependencies all work right in all the lua versions also currently the tests are empty... so that is something that should be completed too
