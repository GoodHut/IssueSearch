 URL : "https://github.com/wp-media/wp-rocket/issues/616" TITLE : don't cache admins BODY : hello. this is not really an issue, but i was wondering about this little addon: https://github.com/wp-media/wp-rocket-helpers/tree/master/wp-rocket-no-cache-for-admins it's a great option and i'm surprised that it's not a part of wp-rocket and only available as a separate helper here on github. is there any chance you can implement it inside wp-rocket?
