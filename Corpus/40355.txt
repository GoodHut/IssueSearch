 URL : "https://github.com/orbitjs/orbit/issues/457" TITLE : ts type compatibilty BODY : i created default angular application and added the following code to app.component js import store from '@orbit/store'; const schemadefinition = { models: { planet: { attributes: { name: { type: 'string' }, classification: { type: 'string' } }, relationships: { moons: { type: 'hasmany', model: 'moon', inverse: 'planet' } } }, moon: { attributes: { name: { type: 'string' } }, relationships: { planet: { type: 'hasone', model: 'planet', inverse: 'moons' } } } } }; const schema = new schema schemadefinition ; it seems it works as a js code, however, as a typescript it produces the following error referring to a relationship type ... types of property 'type' are incompatible. type 'string' is not assignable to type ' hasmany | hasone '. is that a bug or it is expected that it should be used another way?
