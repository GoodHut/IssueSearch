 URL : "https://github.com/statamic/docs/issues/157" TITLE : mislabeled code snippet? BODY : on page https://docs.statamic.com/theming, under the heading, rendering that template , the code snippet when displayed on the web page shows a right-hand label of template. however, i believe it is in fact a layout snippet that's being displayed. fyi, i clicked the edit button to make this suggested change, but despite looking around line 116 and thereabouts on https://github.com/statamic/docs/edit/master/content/collections/docs/theming.md i couldn't figure out where the label was being applied. hence this request being made as an issue. nb. i did make an edit suggestion to the paragraph between the subhead and the code snippet.
