 URL : "https://github.com/Skrylar/skflatbuffers/issues/2" TITLE : macro-based code generator BODY : the most nim way to handle serialization is to embed it along with types being declared to hold serialized messages, and using a compile-time setup to create boilerplate from that. - figure out if custom pragmas show up in compile time reflection. we'll use this if we can, and a macro which edits an entire type section if we can't. - mirror options from the schema as pragmas. - generate builders from nim code and pragmas. - is nimsuggest affected?
