 URL : "https://github.com/w3c/media-source/issues/184" TITLE : expose the actual decoders BODY : it seems rather counterintuitive to force boxing of video frames for the api. when attempting to do real-time interactive applications like web based remote desktop, low latency is key and mse forces a lot of overhead. in an ideal situation allowing raw h.264 encoded frames to be passed to the hardware accelerated decoder and pushed into a video object solves these issues.
