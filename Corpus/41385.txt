BODY : dear olaven, i bought one of your trademark, premium cardgames carddecks because it looked great in the store, but little did i know that it was single use! i could draw cards from the deck no problem, but i could not put the cards back into the deck. furthermore, your decks are unusable for playing any sort of game short of guess the card, because the cards themselves cannot be arranged into smaller sub decks! i am very disappointed with my carddeck, and i will not be buying more cards from you in the future. sincerely, blackcap
