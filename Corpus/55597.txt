 URL : "https://github.com/tildeio/broccoli-typescript-compiler/issues/32" TITLE : js files are clobbered BODY : it appears this may be intentional based on the last paragraph in the readme and this comment https://github.com/tildeio/broccoli-typescript-compiler/blob/master/index.js l6 , but it seems like this is undesirable behavior https://github.com/glimmerjs/glimmer-application-pipeline/pull/2 issuecomment-277488748 . should this passthrough behavior be restored to default behavior and brought back from the shadows of backwards compatibility ie a documentation change ? or should we continue to make our own bypass for js files? cc @rwjblue @dgeb
