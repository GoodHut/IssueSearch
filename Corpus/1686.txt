 URL : "https://github.com/Invenietis/crs/issues/3" TITLE : crs 2 design BODY : main interface icommandhandler is renamed to irequesthandler to support commands and events... and does no longer returns a result but task obviously . csharp public interface irequesthandler<t> { task handleasync t request, icommandcontext context ; } this enforces to treat impacts of a command like pure events. what are your thoughts about that? is it really what we want? should crs still offers a way to return synchronous results of a command or should we left this usage for simple rest-like interactions ?
