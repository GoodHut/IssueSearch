 URL : "https://github.com/rdwatters/hugo-docs-concept/issues/43" TITLE : docs design discussion BODY : okay, i just started fooling around with this, mocking up in my browser. here are some things i did, which are up for discussion. primary goal of these changes is to make the documentation more readable. 1. created a separation between navigation/header and the content below. frankly, the navy blue might be too stark of a contrast, but a good starting place. 2. made the background color of the body near-white, or a slight gray. this is just meant to create a balance of contrast, because on some screens the white becomes very bright. 3. put the contextual/page toc in a box with shadow to clearly separate it from the content it serves. i felt it blended in too much and created an environment where all one saw was a sea of text . 4. created a max width for body copy and centered it so it has white space on each side. it's a basic tenet of setting body copy that it's kept at a reasonable width for reading . 5. left justified the tags. keeping it simple here. they distract the eye to the right out of proportion to their place on the page. 6. added space above headings to better separate one section from another this isn't apparent from the screenshot . <img width= 1440 alt= screen shot 2017-03-17 at 1 44 49 pm src= https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/115347/24056219/450af3c8-0b19-11e7-8bdc-7d78e8e9acdf.png > at any rate, it's just a start to get a discussion going on this.
