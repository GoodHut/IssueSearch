 URL : "https://github.com/ow2-proactive/catalog/issues/82" TITLE : application not debuggable BODY : springboot is not handling class injections properly so it's not possible to debug properly the application for example right click the application main class and select debug as java application on eclipse . a workaround is to debug the bootrun task, but then we loose the stdin/stdout streams.
