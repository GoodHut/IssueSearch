 URL : "https://github.com/apex/apex/issues/852" TITLE : listing function aliases BODY : - __operating system__: os x - __apex version__: 0.16.0 this is feature request rather than a bug report - is there any opposition to opening a pr that provides support for listing the available aliases for a given lambda function or all if no single function was specified ? forgive me if this functionality currently exists and i simply missed it!
