 URL : "https://github.com/gilbertchen/duplicacy/issues/228" TITLE : /library/ cannot be opened BODY : initiating a storage path correctly no error prompts , i ran duplicity backup . it's in a folder on the home directory. i took about a day to have everything packed up. when it reached /library files, all the files returned file library/caches/com.apple.safari/webkitcache/version 11/records/bla/resource/bla-blob cannot be opened or file library/caches/com.spotify.client/data/fb/bla.file cannot be opened seems like a permission issue if all /library files were rejected. must i run it with sudo?
