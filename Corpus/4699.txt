 URL : "https://github.com/capstone-coal/capstone-coal.github.io/issues/31" TITLE : fix docs typos BODY : just noticed a couple improvements that should be made to the docs https://capstone-coal.github.io/docs page: specify that debian 8 was used to build qgis. debian 9.1 was recently released https://www.debian.org/news/2017/20170722 which i plan to use for future development and document accordingly. the code https://github.com/capstone-coal/capstone-coal.github.io/blob/8a98d72ebb90d39b0e85adad233bec5437b44cc7/docs.html l178 in the usage docs uses an undefined variable test_image_name which should probably be input_filename .
