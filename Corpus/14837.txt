 URL : "https://github.com/CleanCut/green/issues/169" TITLE : catch not working BODY : once i start a test run i have to wait for completion - because ctrl-c doesn't seem to do the job : i see it's meant to! https://github.com/cleancut/green/issues/5 what i get instead is a hang and if i'm impatient and press ctrl-c again, i end up in a state where i see keyboardinterrupt tracebacks from cprocess daemonlesspoolworker-160: that number keeps going up each time i press ctrl-c e.g. python process daemonlesspoolworker-161: traceback most recent call last : file /usr/lib/python2.7/multiprocessing/process.py , line 258, in _bootstrap self.run file /usr/lib/python2.7/multiprocessing/process.py , line 114, in run self._target self._args, self._kwargs file /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/green/process.py , line 179, in worker task = get file /usr/lib/python2.7/multiprocessing/queues.py , line 374, in get racquire file /usr/lib/python2.7/unittest/signals.py , line 36, in __call__ self.default_handler signum, frame keyboardinterrupt what i would expect on the second ctrl-c is a complete termination of all child workers - somehow the pool isn't being killed. i'm not doing anything special with green itself beyond running green some.test.module . one potential compounding factor for me is that this is via docker rather than native ubuntu - but it's clearly receiving signals.
