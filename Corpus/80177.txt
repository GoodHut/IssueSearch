 URL : "https://github.com/js-joda/js-joda/issues/135" TITLE : test for mobile browsers BODY : hi all, do you have information on, or tests for, the performance of js-joda on mobile devices? first of all, because there are a lot of mobile visitors to web pages and secondly, it would be great to use this package in cordova, where you build apps using html and javascript. i would love to know whether js-joda, or what parts of js-joda, work on which mobile browsers preferrably android 4.0 and up , and maybe help make it compatible. cheers!
