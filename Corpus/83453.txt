 URL : "https://github.com/influxdata/chronograf/issues/1465" TITLE : cannot open data explorer BODY : this all the sudden started happening in my local testing environment after playing around with chronograf for around 1 hour. i haven't been able to figure out how to fix it. i've recompiled chronograf, restarted my computer. deleted all influxdb data. still i get this every time i click on the data explorer tab. i had compiled from source on the head of master. it's still happening when i checkout v1.3.0. i even downloaded the binary from the releases tab, but i'm still running into this issue. fieldlist.js:90 uncaught typeerror: cannot read property 'some' of undefined at object.render fieldlist.js:90 at reactcompositecomponentwrapper._rendervalidatedcomponentwithoutownerorcontext reactcompositecomponent.js:799 at reactcompositecomponentwrapper._rendervalidatedcomponent reactcompositecomponent.js:822 at reactcompositecomponentwrapper.performinitialmount reactcompositecomponent.js:362 at reactcompositecomponentwrapper.mountcomponent reactcompositecomponent.js:258 at object.mountcomponent reactreconciler.js:46 at reactdomcomponent.mountchildren reactmultichild.js:238 at reactdomcomponent._createinitialchildren reactdomcomponent.js:691 at reactdomcomponent.mountcomponent reactdomcomponent.js:516 at object.mountcomponent reactreconciler.js:46 when i refresh the page on the data explorer tab i get this ! image https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4132322/25978776/7007c6d8-3692-11e7-8e9f-bf1924424970.png i installed chronograf on a separate vm and did not experience this issue. one thing i noticed different is that the data explorer seems to be kicking this request off on my macbook where this isn't working. on the centos vm it is not sending the show retention policies query when hitting the data explorer. ! image https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4132322/25978854/e55cf1e2-3692-11e7-9727-4e2eb68a0f59.png
