 URL : "https://github.com/RAMP-PCAR/dqvue/issues/4" TITLE : implement a zoom slider BODY : higcharts zoom feature https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/chart.zoomtype does not have an accessible alternative. add a slider to charts allowing the user to constrain the amount of data displayed along the x axis y and z axis sliders to be added later . library to use: https://refreshless.com/nouislider/ - display slider if chart's zoomtype is set to x or xy - make slider keyboard accessible - provide additional text fields for direct entry - make sure default slider configuration doesn't break the chart - add an option to supply a full slider configuration along with the chart config note: some chart types pie, heatmap, etc. do not have x axis and should not display the slider.
