 URL : "https://github.com/pazz/alot/issues/1041" TITLE : empty thread list BODY : for me the commit 237499e631741dbb3837e5ef99cc66f842e8a92e produces an empty thread view. i believe the problem is that pipewalker now uses the focus property instead of the get_focus method, that is used by the parent class listwalker. in https://github.com/pazz/alot/blob/master/alot/buffers.py l277 an instance of pipewalker gets passed to listbox, that will be calling get_focus that now is not anymore a reimplementation from the pipewalker but the original implementation of listwalker.
