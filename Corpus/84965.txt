 URL : "https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/440" TITLE : dynamically inject styles BODY : the proposal: it would be useful to be able to pass in the styling as a prop to the react component. or, as multiple props with names like style , wrapperstyle , monthstyle , etc that correspond to the classes found in the style.css https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/blob/master/lib/style.css file. the prop s can have a defaultprops which defaults it the styles specified in the current style.css file. this would eliminate the need to import css, and enable users to override styles in react's javascript inline style https://react-cn.github.io/react/tips/inline-styles.html syntax. how does this idea sound? if this sounds like it would be beneficial, i'd be happy to work on this, and create a pull request for it. mcontext: i'm working on a project where the user can pick from various themes, and we pass in all our styles to our react components as props. when the user changes the theme, the components get immediately re-rendered with the new theme no need to refresh the page . we use styletron https://github.com/rtsao/styletron for making things a bit more efficient, but all our styles are specified in the react's javascript inline style syntax.
