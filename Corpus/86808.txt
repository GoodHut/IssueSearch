 URL : "https://github.com/mattermost/docs/issues/891" TITLE : improve cli documentation BODY : currently, the cli documentation is unclear about what identifier should be used for a command - for example, using the team name for platform team commands doesn't work https://github.com/mattermost/platform/issues/5336 , and you need to use the team url or id. i think we've also had similar questions about what to use for user / channel commands as well. we should update the documentation to make it clear what type of identifier s should be used for the different commands. note: the cli documentation is generated from the cli help in the product, so we may want to change it there as well.
