 URL : "https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet/issues/1438" TITLE : out of gas BODY : anyone heard of singularitynet? yesterday when the individual sale started, i had the opportunity to buy 36.750 agi tokens with an investment of 5 ethers total. after 24 hours, the public sale starts where you can buy as much as you can afford until the hard cap is reached. so i waited literally 24 hours thinking to be one of the first buyers when the public sale starts, but i had no luck because myetherwallet said that my transaction failed because i was out of gas. so, soon after the public sale started, the hard cap was reached in just a couple seconds! it feels like i just missed the boat, so thanks for this.
