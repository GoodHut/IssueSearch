 URL : "https://github.com/grails-plugins/grails-database-migration/issues/120" TITLE : psql schema_name ignored BODY : we've recently migrated our grails 2.5.x app to grails 3.1.x and are facing an issue with our production environment, which is using postgresql with a non-standard schema i.e. not 'public' . in grails itself, this can be configured in the datasource block of application.groovy as: datasource { driverclassname = org.postgresql.driver dialect = org.hibernate.dialect.postgresqldialect username = password = url = hibernate.default_schema = eos } this worked fine in grails 2 but fails in grails 3, with this exception: > liquibase.exception.databaseexception: error: no schema has been selected to create in > position: 14 failed sql: create table databasechangeloglock id int not null, locked boolean not null, lockgranted timestamp without time zone, lockedby varchar 255 , constraint pk_databasechangeloglock primary key id grails itself works correctly if liquibase is by-passed i.e. if updateonstart is set to false . is there some extra configuration needed for this to work? we're on hibernate 4 so using version 2.0.0 of the plugin and reproduced the issue with liquibase 3.4.2 and 3.5.3. not sure if this is a bug or if we're doing something wrong. thanks for any hints!
