 URL : "https://github.com/attic-labs/decent-website/issues/13" TITLE : styles still need help BODY : some issues that i see - body copy is not correct color too light - highlighting on code is not correct - font size inconsistent e.g., inside lists -- see http://noms.io/docs/decent/about/ and http://noms.io/docs/decent/quickstart/ - inline code formatting here http://noms.io/docs/decent/quickstart/ is a mess - top margin on pages is too large should be similar to left margin - something about weight and layout of navbar looks wrong -- ask @jennabilotta but my guess is weight is too heavy, font probably too big, and need to align with body copy.
