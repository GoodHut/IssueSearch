 URL : "https://github.com/jano017/Discord.hs/issues/21" TITLE : examples not using fetch' BODY : the documentation of network.discord.rest makes it seem like there is a much better way to make requests than just using fetch and fetch' . however, all examples currently use fetch' . could you make at least one example showing how to use network.discord.rest.channel and similar? the documentation https://jano017.github.io/discord.hs/index.html is also outdated by a couple versions.
