 URL : "https://github.com/google/jsonnet/issues/403" TITLE : functions vs. keys BODY : i'm new to jsonnet. is it possible create a function that takes arguments and interpolates keys not values with them? suppose that i want the name of b second occurrence below to be assigned from argument b first occurrence . is this possible? in general, can we name keys generated inside functions resolving argument names? { a b, c, d :: { b: { c : c, d : { x : d, }, , }, , }, }
