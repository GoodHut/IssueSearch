 URL : "https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/issues/2582" TITLE : a question about blobdb BODY : when use blobdb with multiple column families, currently all values are store in the blob file, sometimes we wanna store some column families's value in the blob file, and the others we wanna store them in the lsm engine, because some column families's values are short, at the same time we want guarantee the write through multiple column families is atomic. @anirbanr-fb is there any plan to support such feature? thanks in advance.
