 URL : "https://github.com/elastic-rs/elastic-hyper/issues/18" TITLE : upgrade to reqwest 0.3 BODY : hyper 0.10 is now a thing! so we can upgrade reqwest . this doesn't have async support yet, but we could add a sample to elastic_requests that uses a simple hyper client. there isn't much point creating another elastic_hyper build, since async will be supported by reqwest in the future.
