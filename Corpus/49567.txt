 URL : "https://github.com/wbuchwalter/tslint-loader/issues/76" TITLE : typecheck is too slow BODY : the typecheck option makes builds extremely slow because the program is recreated https://github.com/wbuchwalter/tslint-loader/blob/v3.5.3/index.js l63-l67 for each file. gulp-tslint solves this by forcing the user to pas the program in as part of the configuration https://github.com/panuhorsmalahti/gulp-tslint/blob/master/index.ts l23 . i think the same could be done here by replacing the typecheck with a program option? or maybe allow passing the program instead of a boolean to the typecheck ? otherwise it will have to be cached somehow across files.
