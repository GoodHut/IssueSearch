 URL : "https://github.com/geofs-plugins/plugin-manager-V2/issues/3" TITLE : local storage key naming BODY : i think that when we are saving the content of a certain file should be the name of the file. for example when downloading the core file of skyx we should save it like so localstorage.setitem core.user.js , filecontent ; we could add a prefix to the key string to differentiate it from other local storage values and show that this localstorage value belongs to skyx, for example skyx/core.user.js
