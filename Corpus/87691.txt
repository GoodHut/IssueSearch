 URL : "https://github.com/joshsoftware/the_hunger_terminal/issues/127" TITLE : make all the urls restful BODY : restful urls are more elegant looking and concise that urls containing query strings. these are very useful to make clean use of http verbs. this is very important when we are using rest web service. example: using your urls, and imagining you want to post a part , instead of getting it first case should be like this: you are using a get where you should have used a post http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/postpart?param1=lalala&param2=lelele&param3=lilili while on a rest context, it should be http://www.parts-depot.com/parts tasks included under this section: - make most of the urls restful - make all the routes name readable and concise especially routes for report generation
