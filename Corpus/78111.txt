 URL : "https://github.com/sfackler/rust-phf/issues/103" TITLE : phf memory-mapped files? BODY : i'd love to have phf generate at compile-time a file that it can then memory-map at runtime and use as an efficient perfect hash. that would support programs that want to efficiently store and check a large set of words, but want to allow updating that set at runtime without recompiling the program. the usage in the build.rs script would look similar, except that instead of writing out a .rs file, it would write out a data file. phf or some crate depending on it could then provide a function to open that file, which would memory-map the file and use it as a perfect hash. does this seem reasonable?
