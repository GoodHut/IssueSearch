 URL : "https://github.com/jhuckaby/webcamjs/issues/252" TITLE : safari 11 on macos BODY : i'm encountering behavior where if the element the video is attached to is visibility: hidden, the camera just submits the last image it captured over and over again. this is only happening in safari 11 on macos. i'm currently running el capitan, so i'm not sure if the same behavior shows up on high sierra. in order to deal with this issue short term, i tried the following to instantiate the webcam using the force_flash parameter: if navigator.platform == mac68k || navigator.platform == macppc || navigator.platform == macintel && navigator.useragent.indexof safari > -1 && navigator.useragent.indexof chrome == -1 { window.webcam.set { image_format: 'jpeg', jpeg_quality: 100, force_flash: true } ; } else { window.webcam.set { image_format: 'jpeg', jpeg_quality: 100 } ; } unfortunately, the above code doesn't seem to work. i get the error webcam.js error: no supported webcam interface found. any ideas on what i might be doing incorrectly?
