 URL : "https://github.com/replicon/Replicon.Cryptography.SCrypt/issues/23" TITLE : update to netcoreapp 2.0? BODY : when i try to use replicon.cryptography.scrypt in a netcoreapp 2.0 project it compiles with a warning: warning nu1701: package 'replicon.cryptography.scrypt 1.1.6.13' was restored using '.netframework,version=v4.6.1' instead of the project target framework '.netcoreapp,version=v2.0'. this package may not be fully compatible with your project. can you update to 2.0? i'm pretty sure it'd just updating a config file, as your code has no dependencies.
