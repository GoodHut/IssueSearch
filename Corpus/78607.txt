 URL : "https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/10068" TITLE : question: model metadata BODY : does ef core support expressing model metadata in a standard format? tooling for ef classic expressed model metadata as csdl part of edmx , so that tools could read the metadata and perform things like code generation based on the metadata. odata, for example, exposes the csdl as an endpoint, and vs code has an extension https://github.com/apazureck/odatatools that reads it in order to generate typescript files, as does breeze https://github.com/breeze/breeze.tooling/blob/master/metadatagenerator/readme.md . and odata does has a spec http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata-json-csdl/v4.0/odata-json-csdl-v4.0.html for json-formatted csdl.
