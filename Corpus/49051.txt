 URL : "https://github.com/mariuszfoltak/angular2-datatable/issues/98" TITLE : support for angular 4 BODY : when trying to use version 0.6.0 with angular 4 i get warnings of unmet dependencies. are there any plans to support angular 4? or is it perhaps already supported, but the dependencies need to be upgraded? maybe something like ^2.0.0 | ^4.0.0 ?
