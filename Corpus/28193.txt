 URL : "https://github.com/node-schedule/node-schedule/issues/368" TITLE : firing job one time BODY : hi, what i want to achieve is delaying the task 30 min after it's called. is this code snippet a good way of doing it? js var schedule = require node-schedule ; let starttime = new date date.now + 1800000 ; let j = schedule.schedulejob {start: starttime, rule: ' /1 '},function { console.log hello ; j.cancel ; } ; or there's a another way to do it better?
