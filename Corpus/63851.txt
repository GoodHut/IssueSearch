 URL : "https://github.com/terascope/teraslice_file_export/issues/1" TITLE : export as json per line BODY : this module needs a corresponding change to allow exporting data as 1 json record per line as an option similar to what was done for teraslice_file_import. the parameter should be named output_format . the options should be: json_array - this is the current behavior and the default. json_lines - one json record per line we'll likely add additional formats in the future.
