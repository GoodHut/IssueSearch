 URL : "https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer3/issues/3620" TITLE : deploying to iis problems BODY : hi there, i hope someone can help me, and i apologise if this is a silly question. our api is working fine when running in iis express using visual studio. now when i deploy it to iis i am getting some strange errors when accessing identityserver.if i turn off the authorize decoration on my controllers i can access them no bother. when trying to access, for example: https://localhost/projectvision_api/identity/.well-known/openid-configuration, i get the following error: ! image https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7871566/24712140/ed52e8ce-1a19-11e7-866f-723cf3fd7805.png if i give everyone permissions to that file and try again, i get: ! image https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7871566/24712195/1b0667dc-1a1a-11e7-897b-8f9c43d84be7.png are there any other settings i need to setup? i have created a self signed certificate for initial testing, so i do get the https struck through, but that happens when accessing the api or identityserver. thanks in advance for any pointers
