 URL : "https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/issues/387" TITLE : add to contributing.md? BODY : this document https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/blob/gh-pages/.github/contributing.md can be amended with additional information anyone contributing to the technical development rather than the content production of the _programming historian_ website. - how to set up your system with ruby and bundler - how to fork, clone, and then use bundle install to create the proper development environment - standards for documenting and justifying changes, then submitting those changes via pull request. my outstanding questions 1. who on the team will be responsible for reviewing technical prs? 2. do we need an _individual_ on the team who will coordinate other team members doing development work do final sign-off on merging contributions?
