 URL : "https://github.com/JordanRickman/dataflow/issues/8" TITLE : support graph objects BODY : all dataflow nodes should belong to a dataflowgraph - those not explicitly added to a dataflowgraph will belong to an internal default graph. the purpose of such graphs is to conveniently wrap an entire network of data flow. in addition to adding nodes, a dataflowgraph must provide a method to destroy the entire graph at once - thereby simplifying the clean-up process. other methods may be added later, and will be separate stories.
