 URL : "https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-spring-environment-dialect/issues/2" TITLE : spring 5 support? BODY : i've listed spring 4 as a dependency, but hopefully this should work just fine in spring 5 environments too? now that spring 5 has gone ga, i should double-check that. if it works in both, then cool - i can leave the spring 4 dependency there and maven/gradle will resolve to spring 5 if the developer has it in their project instead.
