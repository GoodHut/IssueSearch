 URL : "https://github.com/weprovide/valet-plus/issues/44" TITLE : fr: use gzip for sql files BODY : he, i could have a look to make this myself but i'm not sure about other platform compatibility and what gzip progs to use etc, but it would be great if the db export/dump can directly pipe the sql into a .gz file. also reading a .gz file on import/reimport would be awesome! space is valuable ;
