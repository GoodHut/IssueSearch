 URL : "https://github.com/lodash/lodash/issues/3247" TITLE : lodash-es and lodash/fp BODY : hi! it seems like the fp variety of lodash isn't supported in the lodash-es package. is this intentional? i'm using cra and would like to reduce my bundle size through tree shaking. i've read through this thread https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/1069 and it seems like the cra's lodash babel plugin implementation is waiting for lodash v5. is there still a way to benefit from tree shaking using lodash/fp and something like lodash-es ?
