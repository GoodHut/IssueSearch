BODY : hello everyone, i am working on a new tech tree for my rp-0 careers going forward. i am a person that likes to think linearly, so i have designed a tech tree that works that way. everything is broken up into categories and there isn't really any cross-branching that happens. i understand in the real world, this isn't necessarily how it works as in order to build a better engine, you need to have good enough materials science. however, the way it is organized in the current tree is lacking for me. i have attached an image of the tree as it currently stands in game. i have balanced the costs of the tech nodes so that up through tier 10 modern day , all costs are in line with the current rp-0 tree. there are obviously more nodes than the current tree, and some might possibly not have any parts in it depending on the mods installed. if that is the case, the node is automatically hidden and the tree dynamically adjusts to have the proper prerequisites for opening the next node. i am going to be placing parts into this tree for myself, but i need to know the following: 1. is this something that rp-0 would want to adopt as the distributed in-mod tech tree? 2. if the above is no, would we want to even let people know it exists as an alternative? the answers to the above questions affect how i will proceed. if it is to become the in-mod tech tree, i will immediately place all of the parts that are in the current tree into the correct nodes. my answer would be to distribute this as the official rp-0 tech tree. it is clean, parts can be placed into the proper nodes very easily and it removes having the community tech tree as a dependency. let me know what you think and i will modify my approach! http://i.imgur.com/3jurdmx.png
