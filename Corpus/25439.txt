 URL : "https://github.com/mp4096/indentex/issues/7" TITLE : ! include directive BODY : using the latex command \input{chapter_1_indentex.tex} or input: chapter_1_indentex.tex , i can already include other transpiled files from my main file. but it seems somehow odd to include tex files from indentex files. my feature request: add a special ! include <file.inden.tex> directive. the transpiler will then try to find the referenced file, transpiles it and replaces the directive with the transpiled content. this is of course recursive, meaning that included files may also include files. the search path is relative to the file where the include was found. example: main.inden.tex document: ! include chapter chapter.inden.tex section: my chapter lorem ipsum this is transpiled to main_indentex.tex : \begin{document} \section{my chapter} lorem ipsum \end{document} note: the transpiler emits only a single tex-file.
