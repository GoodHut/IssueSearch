BODY : so, forstwire accepts bcc for donations. they do not have a paid product. if i am not wrong, wikipedia is listed on our site in 'other' but also does not have a product, just accepts btc as donations. i am wondering if we should make a donate or charity section, but with a completely different tweet. one asking to accept bitcoin cash for donations not payments. maybe we add a tag to the new yml that indicates donation but when missing is assumed 'payment' so the wording will be the same besides that word? i think it might be nice to add this, or at least consider this as an option.
