 URL : "https://github.com/crashkonijn/GOAP/issues/3" TITLE : example doesn't work BODY : i tried the included example in an attempt to understand what this does, but the example seems incomplete somehow. when i press play nothing happens, the throwable is disabled and nothing seems to reference it to enable it, as well the goap visualizer is blank when opened, as if there's been no logic implemented. https://i.imgur.com/o0tpnp2.png i'm very interested to see if this will be a viable ai system for a game i'm working on, but the lack of a working example makes that rather difficult.
