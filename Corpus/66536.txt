 URL : "https://github.com/africanmathsinitiative/R-Instat/issues/3432" TITLE : multiple missing values BODY : this is linked to the labels facility. in addition they could perhaps be defined in the metadata window for now. i would like this issue to be discussed for the forthcoming release, even if implementation may be delated. if is is delayed, then there are sufficient potential uses, e.g. in tabulation, in climatic summaries, that i would like it to have high priority immediately following the release.
