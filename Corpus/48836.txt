 URL : "https://github.com/project-ubin/ubin-quorum-setup/issues/1" TITLE : source code not open? BODY : the quorum blockchain tested in project-ubin is a bit different from the one that can be found in the j.p. morgan's repository https://github.com/jpmorganchase . for instance, some zsl functions like zsl_createabcproof are not included in the official release of quorum blockchain. is it possible for you to make those modifications open source so that people can learn more from the project ubin?
