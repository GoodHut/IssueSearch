 URL : "https://github.com/marcbachmann/node-html-pdf/issues/292" TITLE : base64 image on header BODY : hi all, i am trying to include my base64 image on the header. i use this code for this purpose: <img width= 150px height= 49px src= data:image/gif;base64,mycorrectbase64 /> if i put that code on the body of the pdf it works like a charm, if i put it on the header only, it doesn't work. if i put it on the body and on the header it works... why i have this strange behaviour?
