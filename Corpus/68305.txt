 URL : "https://github.com/Wyqer/kp_liberation/issues/249" TITLE : resource trucking issue BODY : kill this issue if it working as planned, but... i accidentally produced too many resources and all the factory storage sites were maxed out. the fob then maxed out and the truck drove back to the factory and waited until i manually loaded 3 boxes into my vehicle. it then dumped it's boxes into the factory and ended the mission back at the fob. this was the only way i could solve the issue logistically, i guess i could have built something for a museum! perhaps there could be a back end solution or notification?
