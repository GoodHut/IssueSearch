 URL : "https://github.com/littlevgl/lvgl/issues/21" TITLE : question about text area BODY : i'm trying to use a text area which is one_line and pwd_mode both set true. using lv_ta_set_cursor_pos lv_ta_cur_last and lv_ta_add_char to append characters shows them on the screen before they are replaced by ' '. however, when i use lv_ta_get_txt i get 'text area' returned and if i use lv_label_get_text i get an empty string. if i also use lv_label_append_text then i am able to get the text back that i would expect. wouldn't it better to have lv_ta_get_txt return the contents of the text area or have i misunderstood how this works?
