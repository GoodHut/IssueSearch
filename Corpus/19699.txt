 URL : "https://github.com/dschep/ntfy/issues/141" TITLE : add signal backend BODY : the signal https://whispersystems.org/ mobile messaging client would be a great fit for ntfy. notably most of the current notification providers do not provide end-to-end encryption. there's already a convenient cli client for signal, signal-cli https://github.com/asamk/signal-cli , that is simple to bootstrap and could handle the bulk of the logic for sending messages. assuming @dschep has no objections to calling the signal-cli directly, implementing a signal provider in ntfy should be rather simple, wrapping those calls in a clean api. happy to work on this.
