 URL : "https://github.com/d-s-x/bomi/issues/10" TITLE : remove custom mpv BODY : i know this is the most up to date fork but it seems that no one will take it up because of the custom mpv. can you remove that and make the gui parts from the code thats there and have it access mpv directly that would eliminate so many problems. also im 99% sure mpv includes most the stuff that was so custom at the time so all options should be able to be added to interface. im not sure if your commit of https://github.com/d-s-x/bomi/commit/a29d40f091f3d982cd14fa4f013df2173f4f4026 was heading to that. i was hopeing that was the case. any info would be appriciated.
