 URL : "https://github.com/apprenda/kubernetes/issues/11" TITLE : preflight fqdn check BODY : there are a variety of system configuration errors such as cloud-init bugs when deploying on aws which can cause hostname and uname -n to be wrong for a given host. this will cause kubeadm setup to fail in interesting and hard-to-figure-out ways it doesn't fail until you start trying to set up dns on the master, for example . this pr adds a preflight check to test whether or not the server can reach itself using that name. this does not catch the case that the fqdn belongs to a different but valid server, but it would catch some of the cases. https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/40771
