 URL : "https://github.com/WikiEducationFoundation/WikiEduDashboard/issues/1148" TITLE : editors not populating BODY : had a workshop event today and although more than 4 people registered for course via outreach dashboard, they aren't appearing under the editor list. this is a huge problem. need this basic functionality, to be able to see editors somewhat instantly. and now i can't follow up with the editors now to see their edits, and have no way to gather their user names now. https://outreachdashboard.wmflabs.org/courses/wikimedia_new_york_city/broadly_@_vice/students please advise. â€“ erika
