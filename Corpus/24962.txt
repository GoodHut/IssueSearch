BODY : i don't know if you've checked mc forums recently, but most people think this mod is dead. if that's the case, ata4, then should pass this mod on to someone else. otherwise, you should at least update to 1.11. i've looked over some of the changes, and it doesn't seem any worse than the 1.9 -> 1.10 update. i, for one, would love to see this mod continue.
