 URL : "https://github.com/careteditor/caret/issues/344" TITLE : toc: adding depth control BODY : before recently making the switch to caret, i was mainly using atom to write markdown, with this toc plugin : https://atom.io/packages/markdown-toc it has a nice feature that allows you to control the depth of it i.e generate a toc with titles from h2 to h4 . i find it particularly useful because i usually write a single h1 title that is the document's title, and all my main sections are h2. because of this, it's not desirable to have the h1 in my toc. would it be possible to have a similar feature in caret? something like toc from:2 to:4 ?
