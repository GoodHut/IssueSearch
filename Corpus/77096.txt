 URL : "https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/927" TITLE : mockito can't unbox void BODY : hi, the following bug was created for powermock: > powermockito doesn't seem to unbox java.lang.void. > i am writing a test for my code that uses google cloud storage api to delete a file. google api returns void for deleting a file. code works fine but when i instruct my test as powermockito.donothing .when delete .execute ; it complains that execute has a return value of void. but powermock just delegates call to mockito in this case and mockito throws exception: org.mockito.exceptions.base.mockitoexception: only void methods can donothing ! example of correct use of donothing : donothing . dothrow new runtimeexception .when mock .somevoidmethod ; above means: somevoidmethod does nothing the 1st time but throws an exception the 2nd time is called i have doubts about expected behaviour. for one side, method return something, but it return a void which always is just void and nothing could be changed. anyway, it could be fixed only on mockito side without dirty hacks .
