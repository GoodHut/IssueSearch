 URL : "https://github.com/KillaMaaki/Netcode.IO.NET/issues/4" TITLE : add some unit tests? BODY : one of the things i noticed when i was developing the c implementation was that unit tests helped me avoid breaking things. as the c implementation starts to mature, can i suggest adding a bunch of unit tests and perhaps a soak test repeated client/server connects and disconnects , would be a really good way to flush out issues, and also to catch any errors if somebody checks in something. eg. you can run the unit tests on each checkin via travis. has worked great so far for the c implementation. cheers - glenn
