 URL : "https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog2-server/issues/3869" TITLE : customized stream ordering BODY : we are using streams to handle differing retention schedules that apply based on the contents and sources of the same classes of log. an example is: - messages that match: eventid: 4634 and source: /appsrv 0-9 .srv/ and targetusername: / a-z a-z 0-9 +- 0-9 +/ are saved into index set 30day - all other messages that match: eventid: 4634 are saved into index set 365day - all other messages are saved into index set 90day crafting stream match rules for these requirements ends up with almost unmaintainable levels of matching rules. a preferable solution would be to specifically define the order in which streams are processed
