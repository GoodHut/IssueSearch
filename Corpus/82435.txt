 URL : "https://github.com/VOREStation/VOREStation/issues/1770" TITLE : add torture player button BODY : brief description of the issue i keep forgetting to add this. ban evaders don't care for the rules, so obviously, we need a way to deal with those who are seriously such sad people that they feel the need to come revenge griff a server full of erping furries. for them, i have a special form of punishment, but currently, it can be avoided merely by turning off admin midis. i want to have a button that specifically says torture which subjects the offending player to one of several ear rape songs prone to getting stuck in their head through their speakers, and spam their chat log with the lyrics, just in case they have the sound turned off. i keep forgetting to add this. code revision - https://github.com/vorestation/vorestation/commit/ee7c895d07f7ef0ec3c39b1e64de6089ddb783f7
