 URL : "https://github.com/kubic-project/caasp-services/issues/22" TITLE : cloudsql install option BODY : i know this is a lot to ask, but i've been trying to configure this to use a cloudsql server instead of the packaged mariadb option and i can't seem to get it to work. any chance someone can point me in the right direction? google cloudsql recommends a proxy connection via the following docs https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/connect-kubernetes-engine and that's where i'm having trouble. getting portus to listen on localhost, with the proxy container running in parallel doesn't seem to work. also, if you try to install this unchanged ie with the packaged mariadb you get the following error: <pre>error: found in requirements.yaml, but missing in charts/ directory: mariadb</pre>
