BODY : i'm on windows, and i have cmake, make, arm-none-eabi, and a gcc compiler installed, and i'm trying to compile for an arm11 device. no, i can't compile on the device, it's not running linux. i need to decode h.265 video streaming over the local network on the device, and it doesn't have hardware h264 or h265 support. it does however have hardware yuv <-> rgb, which is useful. the video is being muxed and demuxed in a custom audio/video format i wrote i'll put it on github when it's finished , because i got fed up with mp4 and mov refusing to stream properly. i tried just adding the 'libde265' folder to my project and compiling, but that didn't work. first problem, my compiler isn't configured to recognize '.cc' extension, so i wrote a script to rename '.cc' to '.cpp' 'cause i like writing scripts. the includes were written like include <libde265/whatever.h> , so the compiler couldn't find the files. i wrote a script to fix that as well, which seemed to work. de265-version.h is missing, so i renamed de265-version.h.in to de265-version.h and manually put the version where it clearly goes. but even after all that, the compilation errors just kept piling up, so eventually i just gave up trying to solve them. obviously, the library isn't meant to be compiled this way. so then, how is it supposed to be compiled? i tried the instructions in the build section of the readme, but cmake just generates a bunch of useless garbage in the build folder, and make says it couldn't find a makefile.
