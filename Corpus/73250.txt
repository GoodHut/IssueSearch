 URL : "https://github.com/ethereum/browser-solidity/issues/394" TITLE : copy files does not work BODY : the copy files feature that can be used to copy files from different browser-solidity deployments fails due to the error typeerror: divstyle is null . this feature loads the other website inside an iframe and then forwards the data via some javascript interface. it might be that this has disappeared with the refactorings.
