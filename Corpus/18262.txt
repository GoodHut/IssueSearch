 URL : "https://github.com/tensorflow/nmt/issues/90" TITLE : string case issue BODY : normally, we save words in the vocabulary in only lower case. this way, if any words in the training data are in upper case, they cannot be found in lookup step will turn into <unk> . in a normal situation, most training data are case mixed, unless specifically pre-processed. is there any way, in any step, from loading the data using textlinedataset, through a series of mapping or filtering , until the text look up from the vocabulary table, to address the string case issue? there are only two options i can see: 1. save all training data texts in lower case. 2. use tf.py_func in a mapping step to convert the strings to lower case. however, none of these seem ideal. any other suggestions?
