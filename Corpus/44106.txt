 URL : "https://github.com/jkoelker/python-nest/issues/85" TITLE : eco temperature issue BODY : for some reason my nest returns none for the away heat and away cool which causes the code to fail to display since it's looking for a float . the issue appears to be here https://github.com/jkoelker/python-nest/blob/master/nest/command_line.py l266 . my python is super rusty this is ugly but i fixed it by switching to: if isinstance device.eco_temperature, tuple and device.eco_temperature 0 != none and device.eco_tempera$ print 'away heat: %0.1fc' % device.eco_temperature 0 print 'away cool: %0.1fc' % device.eco_temperature 1 cheers and thanks for the good library.
