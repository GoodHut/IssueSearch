 URL : "https://github.com/ProjectNami/projectnami/issues/236" TITLE : deploying to azure BODY : i am attempting to deploy to azure, using the link at https://deploy.azure.com/?repository=https://github.com/projectnami/projectnami/tree/latest /form/setup. i am attempting to deploy to a fqdn, but the form does not allow me to specify a fqdn for site name , only a simple alphanumeric string. am i missing something? or do i have to change the sitename inside the php to use a fqdn instead of a azurewebsites.net host? thanks.
