 URL : "https://github.com/rleisti/twofish/issues/2" TITLE : test vector citations BODY : i've spot checked a couple of the officially published test vectors from here specifically 128 bit keys i=1 and i=2 : https://www.schneier.com/code/ecb_ival.txt it appears this implementation fails both of those tests, although it's possibly something i'm doing is wrong. keysize 128 i=1 spot check: prelude codec.encryption.twofish data.largeword numeric b data.bits> 0x9f589f5cf6122c32b6bfec2f2ae8c35a :: word128 == encrypt mkstdcipher 0x00000000000000000000000000000000 :: word128 0x00000000000000000000000000000000 :: word128 false this code does pass the tests in test.hs but i can't find references to those test vectors anywhere. can you clarify where the vectors in test.hs come from? as this appears to be the only twofish implementation on hackage i'd like to make sure it's correct.
