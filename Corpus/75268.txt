 URL : "https://github.com/csete/gpredict/issues/110" TITLE : gpredict 2.x for windows BODY : i am starting this new thread to track status and progress of windows builds, since the original pull request https://github.com/csete/gpredict/pull/84 is now merged and closed. status as of writing: 1. @phlash has updated the build files as well as some source files and can build a binary using mingw64 on debian 9. he uses gtk+/glib binaries from gnome project and these appear to be from 2012/2013. there is a test binary package https://github.com/csete/gpredict/pull/84 issuecomment-354363601 on phil's webiste for testing, but this has stability issues, which can be related to the age of the libraries. we need newer libraries. 2. @gvanem has been building gpredict on windows using his own makefile https://github.com/csete/gpredict/pull/84 issuecomment-353942888 . this seems to support both msys2/mingw and msvc. 3. i have installed msys2/mingw64 on windows following the guidelines on the gtk+ website https://www.gtk.org/download/windows.php . the default instructions set up a 64 bit development environment and i have managed to build a 64 bit binary package http://files.oz9aec.net/gpredict/temp/gpredict-win64-2.1.150.zip that runs stable and looks like the default gnome 3 theme see my comment below .
