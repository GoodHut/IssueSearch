 URL : "https://github.com/pseudomuto/protoc-gen-doc/issues/308" TITLE : create docker image BODY : rather than having to install this package and protoc , there should be a docker image that has volumes defined and can simply be run as needed to generate documentation. ideally, this can work on a small distro like alpine or slim. it should also automatically push a new version for each release.
