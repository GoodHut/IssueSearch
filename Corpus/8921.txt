 URL : "https://github.com/elementbound/difftyper/issues/2" TITLE : skip long files BODY : when adding a file that is huge >1000 lines? , it was either just copied in from somewhere or it takes so long to type that nobody cares. the constraint should be time, not text length. so when actual typing works instead of just adding lines , the added character amount should be taken into consideration.
