 URL : "https://github.com/babel/babili/issues/536" TITLE : backslashes regex problem BODY : found this issue while trying to get the babili-webpack-plugin to work with date-fns https://date-fns.org . the issue is the following, when using the date-fns/format function the formatting regular expression will get messed up. this code: js var formattingtokensregexp = new regexp ' \\ ^\\ \\ | \\\\ ?' + ' ' + formattingtokens.join '|' + '|. ', 'g' will become: js j=new regexp ' \\\\ ^\\\\ \\\\ | \\\\\\\\ ? '+h.join '|' +'|. ','g' as you can probably see this will result in too many slashes and subsequently break the date-fns/format function. wondering if anyone else found this issue before and if it's something persistent if someone could fix it.
