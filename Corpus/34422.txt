 URL : "https://github.com/cfpb/hmda-platform-ui/issues/912" TITLE : change icons in nav? BODY : should we adjust the nav icon steps to include question marks for quality and macro quality edits? question marks seem to be more representative of what we're notifying the user of in those steps. this would have the added benefit of matching the hmda video. additionally, we're currently using an x icon to represent both formatting errors and syntactical/validity edits. it could be helpful to the user to differentiate those steps further. | current | alternate | | --- | --- | | ! screen shot 2017-11-22 at 11 45 38 am https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10562544/33139276-ca038ff6-cf7a-11e7-9f56-9970cf1ee27f.png | ! screen shot 2017-11-22 at 11 15 51 am https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10562544/33139149-6b1d38a2-cf7a-11e7-808e-d519875ecd0c.png |
