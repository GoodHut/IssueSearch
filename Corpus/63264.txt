 URL : "https://github.com/nulloy/nulloy/issues/126" TITLE : display mono/stereo bug BODY : there is an option in the track information settings to use %c to display channels i'm assuming it should display 1 or 2 for mono/stereo . but it does not work because there is another attribute that uses %c. in the help panel is says: %c - comment %c - number of channels when i use %c , it defaults to comment so instead of displaying the channels, it says <empty comment> . on a side note, on this subject, i think the default on the top left should be kbps/khz/channels or mono/stereo thanks! ! percent c issue https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29584374/27357387-e24afb04-55c6-11e7-8053-f6cdf080ced1.png
