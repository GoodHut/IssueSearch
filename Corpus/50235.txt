 URL : "https://github.com/Instagram/IGListKit/issues/1019" TITLE : who should i contact? BODY : i realize this is not the right place to post this but as a fellow github user i thought you guys might be willing to help me out... i accidentally clicked the remove email associated with account link on an email from instagram. when i try to login now it says we detected an unusual login attempt. to secure your account, you need to request help logging in. do you know of someone at instagram i can contact who would be able to actually help me? there appears to be no obvious way to request help logging in ... thanks!! again, i really do apologize for posting this here, i am just desperate...
