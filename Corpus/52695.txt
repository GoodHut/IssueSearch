 URL : "https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/33740" TITLE : could not open session BODY : --------------------------------------------------- bug report information --------------------------------------------------- hello guys, i m having trouble trying to create a cloudera-manager docker image. so, here is the dockerfile : from centos:6.6 copy cloudera-manager.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/ install useful things that are missing from the centos:6.6 image. run yum install -y openssh-clients \ openssh-server \ rsyslog \ sudo \ tar \ wget \ which run yum clean all run yum install --nogpgcheck -y java-1.7.0-openjdk-devel oracle-j2sdk1.7 python-setuptools supervisor cloudera-manager-server cloudera-manager-daemons cloudera-manager-server-db-2 postgresql.x86_64 rsync sudo run easy_install supervisor run yum clean all cmd /sbin/init so, when i ran the conatainer in a privileged way, i can start the services cloudera-scm-server-db cloudera-scm-server but not with a normal way. i m trying to solve this because i want to deploy it on openshift, and i m having trouble making it while it s an privileged mode. the error i keep having is : cloud not open session . when i do : service cloudera-scm-server-db start or /etc/init.d/cloudera-scm-server-db start thank you in advance
