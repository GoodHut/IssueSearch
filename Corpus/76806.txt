 URL : "https://github.com/goliatone/arpscan/issues/12" TITLE : make interfaces optional BODY : arp-scan -l is a valid command but as far as i can tell not possible with your node implementation. i tried setting the value to null but it wouldn't work. i was able to get the feature working the way i had wanted by removing line 47 in arpscanner.js. https://github.com/goliatone/arpscan/blob/e8984984df8cd96dc1521eee663f6ce04d0e0131/lib/arpscanner.js l47 ideally this flag would be optional.
