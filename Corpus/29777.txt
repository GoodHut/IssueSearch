 URL : "https://github.com/FS1360472174/nosql-mongo/issues/44" TITLE : mongo unique 索引 BODY : if a document does not have a value for the indexed field in a unique index, the index will store a null value for this document. because of the unique constraint, mongodb will only permit one document that lacks the indexed field. if there is more than one document without a value for the indexed field or is missing the indexed field, the index build will fail with a duplicate key error. 不可以有多个字段不存在
