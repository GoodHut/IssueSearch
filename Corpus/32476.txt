 URL : "https://github.com/commons-app/apps-android-commons/issues/860" TITLE : use stash to upload BODY : by using the stash-based upload process available in the mediawiki api, we can decouple the uploading of the file content from the decision of the file name. this can be great because it reduces the chance of the file name being taken by someone else during a long upload process, resulting in an overwrite. https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/api:upload has some documentation on it. also, there is a concise code example in python: https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-extensions-uploadwizard/blob/e3a24c604c36d01ba24f456ecccca54dfa21d016/tests/api/upload-wizard_tests.py l52
