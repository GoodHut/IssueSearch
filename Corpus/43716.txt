 URL : "https://github.com/jbasko/configmanager/issues/151" TITLE : declaration -> schema BODY : config declaration is essentially a schema so that's what it should be called. maybe it makes sense to separate config initialisation from schema declaration? config_schema = schema ... config = config_schema.get_config in schema, one would also specify where the configuration is being loaded from and where it would be written to if user decided to save it.
