 URL : "https://github.com/nitroshift/armada-38x-bootloader-recovery-files/issues/2" TITLE : wrt1900ac v2 bootloader? BODY : i have a very new wrt1900ac v2, which i broke and erased the beginning of the nand flash.. : openwrt documentation points to these files, however my device rejects the u-boot-a38x-spi-uart.bin file at about 8% protocol error, i believe . i have been trying everything i can think of to restore this thing without any luck. if i compile the u-boot source from https://github.com/solidrun/u-boot-armada38x using the clearfog board config, and make u-boot.mmc i end up with a u-boot-uart.mmc file which my unit will boot, though once it gets up it is lacking the nand driver/support and so it's not actually that useful. i'd be happy to try to get this compiled myself, but i don't know where to get the actual source tree that you are compiling from.. can you point me in the right direction? do you have any idea why i can't boot the file? does my unit have a slightly different board or something? thank you, and i hope you enjoy your holidays! q
