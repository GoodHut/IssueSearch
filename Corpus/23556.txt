 URL : "https://github.com/dthain/basekernel/issues/39" TITLE : process window api BODY : we need a syscall for updating a window. i am working on it here: https://github.com/johnathonnow/basekernel/tree/feature/windows but there are a few questions that need to be answered: 1. should the process be aware of anything about a window it owns? 2. should processes be allowed to have more than one window? 3. when a process constructs a command for redrawing a window, should this command be stored internally as readable text, or should it be stored in some other form, such as an array of bytes, where a byte might indicate what command follows, along with some bytes following the command byte as arguments?
