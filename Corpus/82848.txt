 URL : "https://github.com/indieweb/wordpress-indieweb/issues/68" TITLE : auto-install base plugins BODY : based on some recent feedback, it sounds like it might be a good idea to auto-install some core plugins. my understanding is this was the case early in the plugin life cycle webmentions semantic linkbacks syndication links brid.gy publish ??? i don't know if the new class we switched to supports this with the other plugins being optional, but i do think keeping with the current wordpress ui is a good thing. perhaps we can contribute back upstream any changes to the class?
