 URL : "https://github.com/APSIMInitiative/ApsimX/issues/2070" TITLE : reports shoujld be sorted BODY : recent changes to the data store have improved database writing speed, but the records in a report now come out in no particular order. this makes the reports very difficult to use. the default order should probably be by simulation id and date, but it would also be good if the user interface incorporated some sort by options perhaps by clicking on column headers to allow for alternative orderings.
