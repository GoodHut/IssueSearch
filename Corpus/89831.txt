 URL : "https://github.com/scitran/core/issues/658" TITLE : remove root flag and mode BODY : a follow-up to 657. good software made for humans does not have modes. the main purpose root serves today is filtering the dashboard - view_all=true can replace it on those endpoints. pinging @elisapoquette and @dpuccetti if they would like to share any thoughts. the ui need not change per-say, but a flag would get renamed and be used less .
