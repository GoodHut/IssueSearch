 URL : "https://github.com/kreait/firebase-tokens-php/issues/1" TITLE : issued at verification BODY : hello, i faced an issue with tokens being randomly rejected due to iat being in future. i figured out my hosting provider time is fraction of second ahead from firebase server and this caused random failures depending on user connection of iat verification because token was sometime issued practically at the same time as checked on server side. temporary, i disabled iat verification but it is obvious security hole. i was thinking - would you be interested in adding possibility to enable/disable verifications with flags or some config? i can imagine for example some sort of offset for iat verification. developers could add few secs tolerance so 1-2 seconds in future would not cause an issue.
