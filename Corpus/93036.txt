BODY : the simple material system in psychopath does not currently support texture mapping. eventually we'll want to do a more sophisticated material system with all kinds of cool shading stuff and maybe even osl if it ends up being compatible with psychopath's approach to things . but as a first step, let's just implement really simple texture mapping to get a taste for things: - textures are fully loaded into memory. no texture cache or mip mapping. - textures are sampled with bilinear interpolation, but no filtering. - each mesh has at most a single set of uv coordinates. - a separate textured lambert material that allows a single texture map to be specified. this bare-basic implementation won't be particularly useful on its own, but will give me a chance to play around with how the basics can be structured. the experience from this will hopefully be useful when switching over to something more sophisticated. plus, it will be fun to play with texturing things.
