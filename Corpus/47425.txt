 URL : "https://github.com/JohnyDays/react-credit-card/issues/24" TITLE : payment lib footprint BODY : hello, as far as i see, the payment lib is used only for checking card type. this is done with a simple array in this lib https://github.com/jessepollak/payment/blob/master/src/index.coffee l5-l102 . what do you think about integrating this inside react-credit-card' ? this would avoid the cost of qj and payment. currently those libs are bundled and almost not used ... tree shaking is impossible with those coffee generated files. cheers
