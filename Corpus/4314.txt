 URL : "https://github.com/dustinmoris/Giraffe/issues/57" TITLE : build on linux BODY : this project should also have a build on travis for linux mono/dotnetcore. i'll submit a pr with the travis file and build.sh probably don't need all of these but a small subset like mono 5.0 and 4.8 https://github.com/theangrybyrd/chessie.hopac/blob/master/.travis.yml i know dotnet test fails on mono https://github.com/microsoft/vstest/issues/445 however if we use dotnet xunit i added support for mono awhile ago https://github.com/xunit/xunit/pull/1213
