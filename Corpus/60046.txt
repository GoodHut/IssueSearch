 URL : "https://github.com/pytorch/tutorials/issues/47" TITLE : web page for tutorials BODY : hi, i've been working on beautifying/integrating all the tutorials on pytorch into one. see https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/778. these tutorials are based on sphinx-gallery http://sphinx-gallery.readthedocs.io and tutorials are executed during build time. i've created a separate repo https://github.com/chsasank/pytorch-tutorials for the tutorials and used gh-pages to host them: http://chsasank.github.io/pytorch-tutorials. i also added my own transfer learning tutorial https://chsasank.github.io/pytorch-tutorials/tutorials/transfer_learning_tutorial.html after a discussion with @soumith, he suggested we should host these tutorials at tutorials.pytorch.org. he also requested a change: - categorize tutorials by level instead of source if indeed this is to be front face of tutorials, we'll need to figure out - how to modify the repo - how to build the sources and host since these are executed at build, we might need a decently powered build environment. most tutorials take may be 5 min on my macbook air. except seq2seq https://chsasank.github.io/pytorch-tutorials/practical-pytorch/seq2seq-translation-tutorial.html tutorial, which took 40 min on cpu/25 min on gpu. thanks, sasank.
