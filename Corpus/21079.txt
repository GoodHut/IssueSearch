 URL : "https://github.com/bogdan/datagrid/issues/229" TITLE : drill down filters BODY : so i worked out a way to build drill down filters and figured it might be useful to someone else. i couldn't find anything in the repo about this so i'll post it here. perhaps it better fits in a wiki page, let me know. rb filter :foobar, :enum, select: proc { |grid| grid.assets.unscope :limit .unscope :offset .do_stuff } do |value, scope| scope.where foobar: value end this allows you to use the filter scope from existing selections but not limit the scope to results on the current page. with this you can build filters that themselves are built from filtered values.
