 URL : "https://github.com/ObjectiveSubject/hbsc/issues/96" TITLE : event: links not in red BODY : @joauv the client just added this event https://www.harrietbeecherstowecenter.org/programs-learning/salons-at-stowe/salons-at-lunch-9-27-17/ and included links in the event but they aren't appearing in red text as they should, could this be because they are italicized? if so, would it be possible to override so links in italic also display in red text?
