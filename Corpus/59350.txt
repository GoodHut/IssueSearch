 URL : "https://github.com/nextic/IC/issues/357" TITLE : travis taking too long BODY : lately, travis is taking too long to make the build. the last one is over 20 minutes and seems to be stuck in the tests rather than in the downloads or in the setup. i don't know if the parallel testing is the issue here, but i don't see any other reason. also, the output of travis contains stuff i haven't seen before, but i did never pay too much attention to it anyway.
