 URL : "https://github.com/genome/pindel/issues/56" TITLE : small test deprication BODY : are the results in the small test outdated? i am getting different results when i am running the commands inside the make file than are output into the targetoutput file. if the results are no longer accurate, if you could make note of that, it would be appreciated. https://github.com/genome/pindel/tree/master/test/smalltest however, when i run the commands and compare the results from the devtools run_regressiontests.sh, it matches.
