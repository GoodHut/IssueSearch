 URL : "https://github.com/JavaScript-NZ/Society-Meetings/issues/55" TITLE : next year's conference BODY : i'm certainly going to have more bandwidth to think our it after this year's conference, but i wanted to at least jot down a few points for discussion. when i initially was thinking about the conference, one of the key planks of my proposal was that we rotate between different cities see issue 35 https://github.com/javascript-nz/society-meetings/issues/35 . it fits in with one of my core drivers for the conference - affordability and accessibility - in that we expose the conference to a rotating set of 'locals' and local students. an obvious downside is that you need to engage with different conference runners every year - but on the other hand organising doesn't become such a huge drag / stress generator as a particular local team only gets tapped every 3 or 4 years. with the nz.js ; committee as a steering board, and previous runners available for advice and guidance, we could make the event more resilient and sustainable over a number of years. i know this format _is_ achievable because kiwi pycon does it christchurch -> dunedin -> auckland -> wellington . my suggested would be that we'd look to get interested core teams to submit proposals. it would obviously be a boost to be able to have the outline of a process in place by the conference so we could announce it during the closing. anyhow this is just my initial thoughts, keen to hear what other think.
