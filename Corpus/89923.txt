 URL : "https://github.com/WaelHamze/xrm-ci-framework/issues/31" TITLE : request channel timed out BODY : hi, i am trying to import a solution over the import solution task within a release definition. after about 20secound i get following error form the task: the request channel timed out while waiting for a reply after 00:01:59.9843759. increase the timeout value passed to the call to request or increase the sendtimeout value on the binding. the time allotted to this operation may have been a portion of a longer timeout. any ideas? i tried to import a solution over the xrm toolbox task which worked fine. thanks julian
