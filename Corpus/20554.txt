 URL : "https://github.com/mcbergsma/expresso/issues/4" TITLE : commented out code BODY : simplify - be sure to remove commented out code as this can serve as a distraction to other people or your future self viewing your project. if you see the commented out code - you might wonder what it is for or what it's original purpose is. descriptive comments are fine, but commented out code ideally would not be pushed to github. this is not an actual problem in your project aside from a few commented out albeit harmless console.logs in employeecontroller.js.
