BODY : hey there, thx for this awesome packages but i got few questions... in the basic example we have to attach the schema. but sometimes i need to only get a part of another schema like the meteor.user.profile . so i always need to create a new mongo collection 'null': example with just an email field that i need for user want to change his email address: import simpleschema from 'simpl-schema'; import text from 'simple-react-form-material-ui/lib/text'; const emaildb = new mongo.collection null ; <=== null const emailschema = new simpleschema { email: { label: 'adresse mail', type: string, regex: simpleschema.regex.email, srf: { type: text, }, }, } ; emaildb.attachschema emailschema ;<=== need attach it just for the autoform export {emaildb, emailschema}; but in another hand i would like to pick just the 'email field' from the meteor.users per example... we have other alternative with the uniforms packages which take only the simpleschema but for few reason i would like to stay with yours. do you have alternative about my issue ? thx in advance.
