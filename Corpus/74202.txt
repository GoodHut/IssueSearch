 URL : "https://github.com/lneuhaus/pyrpl/issues/305" TITLE : easier startup procedure BODY : we should do two things to facilitate new users getting started especially those using the .exe distribution : - when running from the command line creation of pyrpl instance fails due to missing/incorrect arguments, display a help message with the command line arguments - pop up a start widget that allows to select an existing configuration or to set up a new one, especially proposing to enter/select a redpitaya device. the best option here would be to auto-detect the available redpitayas on the local network. it is not clear how to do this, the brute-force option being to attempt an ssh connection with user=root and password=root, otherwise password prompt to all ips, and then detect whether a redpitaya is responding. detecting a redpitaya could be done by obtaining the mac address and checking for the first four or six hex-digits. are there better alternatives?
