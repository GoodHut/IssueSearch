 URL : "https://github.com/iseulde/rename-wp-login/issues/28" TITLE : ssl not load css file BODY : hello, the plugin works great but sometimes it not loads the css in the login page. the page at https://domain.com/manager was not allowed to run insecure content from http://www.domain.com/wp-admin/load-styles.php?c=0&dir=ltr&load%5b%5d=dashicons,buttons,forms,l10n,login&ver=1d8acd7e89a11e854b89a07ae8f16eb0. could be because, in my settings, i left http inside the site url field? i also use wordpress https https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-https/ for mixed content fix. thanks for any suggestions
