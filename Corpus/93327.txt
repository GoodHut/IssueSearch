 URL : "https://github.com/sonnetmedia/brooklinebooksmith.com/issues/196" TITLE : add rare books on ubc page BODY : the thing is with the ubc page is that we'd be featuring rare books on there to start , and only one copy of that book too. there's actually no e-commerce element to it, because they won't be able to purchase those books online. each listing would have a photo we've taken of the book, a description we've written, and whether it's available or not, and then customers would call the store to ask about it if they wanted it. in some cases, maybe even a thumbnail of the book cover, title and availability on the landing page, and then if people click on it it would open to a blog post that has more information about the book. hopefully that makes sense...having a tough time articulating today!
