 URL : "https://github.com/SalvationDevelopment/YGOPro-Salvation-Server/issues/363" TITLE : link arrow search filter BODY : i would like to create a search filter similar to the one used by konami's official database https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action . you would have to view the site with the japanese language to use it properly since there are no link monsters currently legal in the tcg. here's how i feel it should work: - have the link arrow selection appear similar to how it does on konami db, and selecting link monster for the monster typing dropdown could reveal it - for every arrow selected, the search filter can append and desc like %ðŸ¡±% for the case of clicking the top arrow or and desc like %ðŸ¡·% for the bottom-left arrow when querying the database. all link monsters have these unicode symbols, making this particular task relatively easy.
