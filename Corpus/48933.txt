 URL : "https://github.com/makersacademy/problem-solving/issues/86" TITLE : step 11 clarification BODY : when it says to add the .gitignore file to your project is it correct to use echo .gitignore >> directory.rb ?? as i did this and now the directory file won't run as it says it is expecting an end. i'm not sure how else you could add it to the file so wondered if anyone could clarify/correct me?! thanks and sorry if i'm just being a bit dim!
