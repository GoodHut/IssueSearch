 URL : "https://github.com/CollinEnstad/Bitcoin-Cash-Barbershop-Spot/issues/3" TITLE : 30 second voiceover audio BODY : https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dlk07vmrxonbgw2xzamljn6moemideq8 i edited his long version to make a thirty second spot. obviously some minor changes would be needed. the beginning would have to be, sitting in his barber chair, george suddenly realizes he left his wallet at home and then saying his son, andy, at some point. minor changes that kevan could do easily. this 30 second version gets to the point much quicker. it is still 2 seconds over 30 seconds, but that could be fixed easily by some speed changes some parts are already sped up somewhat
