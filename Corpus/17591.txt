 URL : "https://github.com/elysium-project/server/issues/765" TITLE : pve poison levels BODY : currently all poison removal items work in pve regardless of the poison level while the tooltips of these items clearly state that they should only work up to certain levels. anti-venom http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=6452 - up to level 25 strong anti-venom http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=6453 - up to level 35 powerful anti-venom http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=19440 up to level 60 elixir of poison resistance http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=3386 - up to level 60 correct behaviour would be for these to only work when mob that casted the poison is same level or lower as in items the tooltip. which would mean that none of these work on bosses like viscidus and that would allow you to revert the custom cd you added to elixir of poison resistance.
