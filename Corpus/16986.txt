 URL : "https://github.com/MPIIComputationalEpigenetics/DeepBlue/issues/158" TITLE : mouse gene models BODY : querying deepblue i have realized it contains several mouse genomes, but no gene model linked to these ones. could you add them, please? i have been researching a bit. for mm9 ncbim37, grcm37 the only available gencode release is the first one m1 http://www.gencodegenes.org/mouse_releases/1.html . the other gencode releases are compatible with mm10 grcm38 , so you can use either the latest one m13 http://www.gencodegenes.org/mouse_releases/13.html or the nearest one to the projects' release dates using mm10 as reference.
