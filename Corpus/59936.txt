 URL : "https://github.com/gustavkarlsson/rocketchat-jira-trigger/issues/41" TITLE : verify requesting user BODY : relating to security and privacy it would be great if the requesting user could be verified that he is permitted to view the request issue. if the user has access the issue should be posted otherwise nothing should happen. do you plan to implement such a security feature?
