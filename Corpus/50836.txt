 URL : "https://github.com/n9iels/mod_jversions/issues/4" TITLE : add caching for module BODY : there seems to be no caching whatsoever for this module, this means that on each page request a request is send to the joomla update server. this seems a bit overkill as we don't have so many joomla releases. being able to cache the request and have a time set for the cache would alleviate the number of requests.
