 URL : "https://github.com/adamcooke/staytus/issues/194" TITLE : smtp with tls send fails BODY : i've got an smtp server configured, running off master so i have the latest initializers as in 160 . my worker log is indicating a failure to send: worker host:ip-172-31-31-156 pid:14671 job issue send_notifications id=4 failed 0 prior attempts with net::smtpauthenticationerror: 530 must issue a starttls command first in theory by default the smtp initializer should be using starttls if its required, so i'm not sure why this is happening.
