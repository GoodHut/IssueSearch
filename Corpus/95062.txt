 URL : "https://github.com/phetsims/tasks/issues/887" TITLE : convert teacher tips files BODY : - play around with these two pages documents. see if you can find an easy way to transfer the styles from the function-builder-basics-guide-helvetica.pages doc to the function-builder-guide.pages doc. teacher tips.zip https://github.com/phetsims/tasks/files/1257777/teacher.tips.zip - go through each sim folder phet files > phet sim design > sim name html5 folder and download the current tips file. these might be .pages, .docx, or .pptx. hopefully an editable one exists for each sim... if not, you might only have a .pdf to work with. - make a google spreadsheet with all html5 sims listed to keep track of your progress. start with columns for downloaded and file type? , updated and a column for uploaded . wait before doing any actual updating, as we are still refining the exact style of the documents. the main component that is still not finalized is the header at the top.
