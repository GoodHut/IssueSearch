 URL : "https://github.com/baugarten/node-restful/issues/150" TITLE : cast to objectid failed BODY : i am receiving this on all attempts to get or delete by id. i was trying a very simple implementation to learn how to build simple rest apis. i have, what i thought, was a very simple mean stack example. model definition: // dependencies var restful = require 'node-restful' ; var mongoose = restful.mongoose; // schema var productschema = new mongoose.schema { name: string, sku: string, price: number, updated_at: { type: date, default: date.now } } ; // return model module.exports = restful.model 'products', productschema ; i was able to add via post, and this is returned using the get to /api/products: { _id : 586d9d3b3d618b1d481a395f , name : test product , sku : lkiuhygs , price :12.99, __v :0, updated_at : 2017-01-05t01:11:23.478z } so, the post works, get all works. any put or get specific by the id errors, example get request below, and the error. get request sent in postman: http://localhost:3000/api/products/586d9d3b3d618b1d481a395f error returned in postman: { message : cast to objectid failed for value \ 586d95629202a834e871eff9\ at path \ _id\ for model \ products\ , name : casterror , stringvalue : \ 586d95629202a834e871eff9\ , kind : objectid , value : 586d95629202a834e871eff9 , path : _id } i admit i am just starting out on this, so the issue may be with me!
