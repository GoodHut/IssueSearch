 URL : "https://github.com/hunttis/alkomaholi/issues/6" TITLE : make the deving not clunky BODY : deving is possible now, but ui changes refresh slowly and the whole thing is silly in any case. the react app can already be started separately, but using it that way requires cors requests, which are annoying. build a proxy so the react app can be started separately and ui refreshes are applied immediatelly.
