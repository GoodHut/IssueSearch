 URL : "https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/issues/2261" TITLE : convert method page number BODY : the minimagick convert method is: convert format, page = nil but, the convert method for carrierwave is: def convert format process :convert => format no way to pass in page option end i am getting errors converting multi-page pdf files single page pdf are processing fine . unless i am mistaken probably am , the errors i am experiencing might be resolvable if i could specify to minimagick to only worry about the first page. i wish minimagick instead used convert format, page = 1 ...but, i'm sure they have their reasons. is their a way in carrierwave to specify a page number in the carrierwave convert method? should/could there be? i could work on a pull request, but i'm assuming this does not currently exist in carrierwave for a good reason...or, i am misunderstanding some functionality here. thanks!
