 URL : "https://github.com/lucko/LuckPerms/issues/505" TITLE : not issue, just a question BODY : hey everyone, this is not an issue reporting, i'm here just to ask a question : i've configured the group a with 40 permission nodes just examples and now i want to configure the group b with the same 40 permission nodes and some other permissions in plus. is there any way to transfer all permissions of a group to another group automatically instead of re-typing them manually? thanks
