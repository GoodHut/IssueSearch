 URL : "https://github.com/guardian/media-atom-maker/issues/258" TITLE : saving videos workflow BODY : edits to videos should only be saved when we click on the click on the yellow tick so we can validate user input. when a user is in editing mode, the atom cannot be published. the atom will become publishable again once both the metadata and youtube metadata editors have been closed. the user will have to fix these issues before the editor will be closed. if there are validation issues e.g. missing title , the yellow tick button that closes the editors should be disabled. in the future, we might want to join the metadata and youtube metadata fields together to make the editing and publishing states clearer.
