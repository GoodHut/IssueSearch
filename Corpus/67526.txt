 URL : "https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/818" TITLE : preview button behavior BODY : inspired by 659, let's discuss what the preview button should do. very very early and casual feedback suggested to me that a split screen preview feature was something people desired. so here's a mockup. ! preview https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1204802/26147071/ae0b98c4-3af2-11e7-92bb-65819119ecf5.png ! preview splitscreen https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1204802/26147109/c9d5933e-3af2-11e7-8de6-76ce04006985.png in this draft flow, we treat the preview button as part of a toggle group , which means toggling it untoggles post settings. the two buttons were designed like this from the start, which is why they have labels, and are separated from the others. there's a open in external window button on the preview toolbar. resizing the preview window is essentially a way to test the responsive look of the post also. this is one flow we can explore. another option is to simply open the preview in a new tab when you click the editor bar button, which is the current behavior. though in that case we'd probably want to move the button out of of the toggle group separator.
