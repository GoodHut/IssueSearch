 URL : "https://github.com/lenosisnickerboa/csgosl/issues/65" TITLE : run settings bug BODY : in run settings there are few options related with players & misc. some can be filled by giving a value or number while some have tick option fillwithbots,killcam & friendlyfire . the issue is that when you use fullconfig settings the gamemodes convars are overriden by run settings convars. for eg. if i don't tick the friendlyfire in run settings, this will affect in all other modes, from casual to training. this makes all other modes to use the same friendlyfire setting as specified in run mode. this is undesirable in competitive mode but used in all modes friendly fire . i faced the same issue with other options where value was used. they also showed same bug. suppose i set roundtime in run settings under misc section as 10 then in all other modes roundtime was 10 after saving the file. so please remove those settings as they are overriding the convars in other modes.
