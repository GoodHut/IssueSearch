 URL : "https://github.com/arkayenro/arkinventory/issues/957" TITLE : bad window drawing BODY : all windows' including bag, bank and guild bank initial drawing became very bad, starting somewhere way off the screen with a big black square, flickering and jumping around for 4-5 seconds before settling at the intended position. enabling/disabling reposition on show does not help. the non-initial window drawing is slightly better, flickering and moving around but not for that long, just 1-2 seconds on every open. this problem is present since r657, it was totally ok in r655 not sure about r656 .
