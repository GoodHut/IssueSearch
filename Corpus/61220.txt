 URL : "https://github.com/jimkyndemeyer/js-graphql-intellij-plugin/issues/70" TITLE : allow .graphqls file in BODY : thanks for the awesome plugin! it would be nice if this plugin would recognise .graphql and .graphqls files instead of only .json files when configuring file . now i have to parse my .graphqls file first or start up a server. json { schema : { file : data/example.graphqls } } or is there an another way to point this plugin to a .graphqls file instead of graphql.schema.json ?
