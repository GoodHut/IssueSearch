 URL : "https://github.com/ljo/exist-sparql/issues/4" TITLE : move to exist-db github BODY : this seems like a useful module that at least 3 other organizations would like to use. can we please move it to the exist-db repo? i think that would both raise its profile and make it easier to collaborate.
