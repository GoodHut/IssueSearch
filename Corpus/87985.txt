 URL : "https://github.com/Macaulay2/M2/issues/569" TITLE : minimal gb in local rings BODY : the mora algorithm in m2 is supposed to return a minimal groebner/standard basis, but sometimes it doesn't. as an example: r=qq{x,y,z} i=ideal xyz+z5,2x2+y3+z7,3z5+y5 transpose gens gb i -- this is not minimal gb... bug!! the problem is in e/reducedgb-field.cpp. the minimize routine used there orders the polynomials or module elements in an incorrect order for local orders and so returns a larger gb than desired.
