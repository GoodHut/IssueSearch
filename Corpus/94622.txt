 URL : "https://github.com/Juniper/jsnapy/issues/251" TITLE : change in lookup behaviour BODY : @vnitinv , @eeishaan suggests that the lookup of config files specified at https://github.com/juniper/jsnapy/blob/master/setup.py l52 to be retained, currently commented out. as per the current code, the .jsnapy folder is being used as a single directory for the virtual environment jsnapy. a good option can be, that change the virtualenv .jsnapy directory to any different name like .jsnapy_venv . this will keep compatibility with version 1 code also and would not confuse with .jsnapy created by default during setup. @eeishaan please add your suggestions accordingly.
