 URL : "https://github.com/ESMCI/cime/issues/1488" TITLE : python 3 format usage BODY : in pr 1471 i objected to the usage of python3 syntax format statements instead of %s as used throughout the code. now i've noticed that this usage was introduced to the trunk in pr 1388 master is failing pylint tests due to 1388 - while fixing the pylint test can you please revert to %s usage throughout?
