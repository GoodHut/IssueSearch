 URL : "https://github.com/Gibberlings3/RealMod/issues/4" TITLE : suggest a license BODY : when it comes to community maintenance, discussions often get stuck on getting the author's permission for modification and so on. so i suggest we put a license file in here, as a good practice example. i would go with gpl2, but the choice isn't really that important, just that there is public record of being open source in the free software sense. thoughts?
