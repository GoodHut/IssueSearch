 URL : "https://github.com/dropbox/SwiftyDropbox/issues/173" TITLE : swift 3.2 support? BODY : i have an ios 11 app i'm building with dropbox support, and xcode 9's compiler of course won't use any swift 3.1 frameworks. this is basically a hard stop for anyone using carthage as there's no easy way to override the swift version setting i can figure out. if you're using cocoapods, you can do the good ol' hack that anyone who has dealt with swift version pain before has done: post_install do |installer| installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target| target.build_configurations.each do |config| config.build_settings 'swift_version' = '3.2' end end end but really, i'd prefer just proper swift 3.2 support : obviously this has some dependency requirements on alamofire, which hasn't announced their plans yet for migration to 4.0 https://github.com/alamofire/alamofire/issues/2139 .
