BODY : hi there, i would use two atheros nics on one pc. therefore, i run two identical recv_data and both try to use the same file /dev/csi_dev. is it ok, or have i to separate that file that each nic and recv_data will have the own csi_dev file? is it possible? and what does this file and who writes data into? thanks.
