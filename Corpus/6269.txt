 URL : "https://github.com/Contentify/Contentify/issues/128" TITLE : a few questions BODY : thanks so much with your help yesterday. i've got a few last questions today which i hope you can help with. i'm experiencing a couple errors, firstly when i try and navigate to the modules component in the admin backend i'm getting an error > errorexception in collection.php line 1187: > undefined index: enabled also the captcha on the registration form is not displaying correctly. i've completed the suggestion here https://github.com/contentify/contentify/wiki/troubleshooting captcha-image-not-displayed https://github.com/contentify/contentify/wiki/troubleshooting captcha-image-not-displayed but no luck. when i open the image in a new tab i get the error > fatalerrorexception in captcha.php line 22: > call to undefined function contentify\imagecreatefromjpeg finally i'm looking to setup the job needed for the twitch streams but again my knowledge is lacking here, if i go to /jobs i get this error which probably means something isn't quite right > fatalerrorexception in streamapi.php line 16: > call to undefined function app\modules\streams\curl_init any guidance would be appreciated. thanks.
