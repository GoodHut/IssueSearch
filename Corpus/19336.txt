 URL : "https://github.com/freedombox/android-app/issues/6" TITLE : ability to sign in BODY : - the app user should be able to sign in to the app using their freedombox credentials - the same credentials that they use for plinth and ssh login. - the app should be able to identify whether the user is an administrator identify user group in general using the information returned from the sign in. - the user should be able to request the freedombox administrator for an account if they don't have one, from within the app. - the app should keep the user signed in and securely store the user's password since it will use the same credentials to sign in to the other freedombox apps as well.
