 URL : "https://github.com/mebjas/CSRF-Protector-PHP/issues/69" TITLE : help with submitting form BODY : i'm new to this library and trying to implement it, but don't quite understand an issue i'm running into. i have a hidden form that has always been submitted via an anchor tag with js to submit the form. this fails validation on the page i'm posting to... but if i simply change the submission to a submit button it works fine. before i try to convince my boss to change the appearance, is there something i'm missing?
