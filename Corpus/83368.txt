 URL : "https://github.com/trilbymedia/grav-plugin-tntsearch/issues/9" TITLE : can't perform first index BODY : hey guys, i've been developing a site for a while now on my own computer in mamp. i have tntsearch installed there and it works great. now that i've installed a fresh version of grav with tntsearch on my vps i can't get the plugin to perform its first index. i've tested that sqlite3 is installed correctly and pdo appears to be enabled by default and i've verified that from a php.info page. i'm also running php7 when i press the red index content button it just spins _eternally_. permissions are set to 775 and everything in the root is owned by apache. every other plugin is working as expected and the site is serving properly. there is no grav.index created in users/data/tnt.search either. i'm not really certain where i can start looking for problems as i can't find any info about logs or debugging. not to mention i don't know very much about php in the first place. i'd really appreciate any help or advice, i've been trying to get it to work for days now.
