 URL : "https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/issues/1081" TITLE : deepspeech on windows BODY : windows support is not supported apparently yet but there are many users including me that want to run deepspeech on windows. i found a way to run it through wsl on windows 10 and i wrote the guide here: https://fotidim.com/deepspeech-on-windows-wsl-287cb27557d4 perhaps you should consider mentioning wsl support in the readme.
