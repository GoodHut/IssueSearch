 URL : "https://github.com/tenplus1/mobs_redo/issues/71" TITLE : remove the type attribute BODY : currently, all mobs must have a type attribute animal , monster or npc . but i think using this attribute is rather unwieldy and unflexible. > type animal is used for wandering mobs, monster for those that attack players and some animals and npc for those that can attack monsters... the way you defined it makes it look like the type attribute is redundant to other attributes, like attack_animals , attacks_monsters and specific_attack . so i think the type doesn't really make sense anymore, it looks redundant and may even be inconsistent. i suggest to deprecate this attribute and maybe change or add other attributes to reflect all of the unique properties of each of the types. this would give more freedom in defining mobs. i don't know how these mob types work exactly, but you already hinted earlier that you want to replace this system. i post this here as a reminder for you.
