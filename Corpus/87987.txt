 URL : "https://github.com/haltu/muuri/issues/74" TITLE : minimize layout thrashing BODY : currently muuri is guilty of layout thrashing. i've tried to my best to keep it as minimal as possible, but the code base has been growing with a fast pace and there is a lot of room for improvement in this sector. the idea would be to go through the code base and minimize layout thrashing as much as possible. here are a few good reads about the subject: http://wilsonpage.co.uk/preventing-layout-thrashing/ https://gist.github.com/paulirish/5d52fb081b3570c81e3a https://github.com/wilsonpage/fastdom
