 URL : "https://github.com/franciscop/server/issues/9" TITLE : create subdomain router BODY : add a new subdomain router: js const server = require 'server' ; const { sub } = server.router; server sub 'user', userrouter , // a specific router sub /^app\_/, approuter , // a regex router 'es', 'en', 'jp' .map lang => sub lang, langrouter , // map to several routers homerouter, // anything left sub 'www', homerouter // explicit www subdomain ; things to take into account: - no route doesn't make sense => it'd be the same as omitting it. - how differently should subdomain vs www. subdomain be treated? it should at least be documented.
