 URL : "https://github.com/Shinmera/CLSS/issues/6" TITLE : select multiple in one go BODY : it would be nice to be able to select multiple items with a single function call. i know lquery lets me do this, but there could be some nice optimization possibilities if we could also do this in clss. lets assume we need to do a query such like this one: select very-specific select table select .columns doc . and lets say that the .columns selector results in 100 matches, the table selector results in 100 matches per match and the very-specific selector in only one match per match of the .columns selector. this means the resulting vector is 100 long, however we had an intermediate vector of 10000 long. i think this could be doable by passing an accumulator to match-pair . would you be interested in a pr that would add this functionality?
