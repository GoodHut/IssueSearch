 URL : "https://github.com/brentp/cyvcf2/issues/61" TITLE : slow speed of vcf.samples BODY : hi brentp, cyvcf2 is very good, thanks for your effort! but i found the vcf.samples is very slow in this code: the test.vcf is just a part of 1000k genome file ~1000 head lines with ~2500 samples. python from cyvcf2 import vcf vcf = vcf test.vcf for variant in vcf: for i in range 0,len vcf.samples : print vcf.samples i however, when i store vcf.samples as a new python variable, it is fast. python from cyvcf2 import vcf vcf = vcf test.vcf samplenames = vcf.samples for variant in vcf: for i in range 0,len vcf.samples : print samplenames i so, i infer there may be some excessive behaviour when using vcf.samples.
