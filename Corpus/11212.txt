 URL : "https://github.com/mozilla/discourse/issues/96" TITLE : fix upload issue BODY : uploading to discourse will regularly fail, with the upload counter stuck at 100% and nothing appearing. occasionally it will succeed after waiting a while, with the browser also receiving messages about the completed upload of previous attempts. no errors appear in the discourse logs or browser console, making me believe this is an s3 issue @flamingspaz.
