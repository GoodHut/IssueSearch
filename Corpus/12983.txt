 URL : "https://github.com/briansmith/webpki/issues/47" TITLE : source of badder BODY : hello, in some test code i'm using locally generated certificates. when i try to connect to a service using one of these certificates i'm getting the error badder . unfortunately that's all i can seem to get, and when looking at the code it seems these could be generated in one of many places. is there any way to narrow down exactly what went wrong?
