 URL : "https://github.com/Daltron/BigBoard/issues/5" TITLE : app transport security BODY : i was wondering if there was a reason the query call to the yahoo api is 'http' instead of 'https'. with apple getting close in the future to requiring apps to use https is that possible to change. i know of the setting to turn this requirement off but it'd be nice not to have to ask apple for special permission if it's not needed.
