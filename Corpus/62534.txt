 URL : "https://github.com/p455w0rd/p455w0rd-s-Things/issues/49" TITLE : config file not working BODY : anything i change in the config file does nothing in-game. all my other mods config files are working fine, but the p455w0rdsthings.cfg isn't registering for some reason. for example, i set the enableenderman to false, but they still spawn. i also tried the disableemc, but the items still have emc values. i'm using this version: p455w0rdsthings-1.10.2-2.2.32.jar
