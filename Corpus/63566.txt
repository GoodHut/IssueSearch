 URL : "https://github.com/jbrzusto/TO_DO/issues/117" TITLE : empty tag registrations BODY : stephanie feign tried uploading some tag detections, job 599833. all the 200 series she uploaded were fine, but tags 45-94 failed because no tags detected in file tag045.wav . i looked at the files, the recordings show very very small blips for each burst, but they looked just as small for the 200 series which registered fine - does she need to re-record?
