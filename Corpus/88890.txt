 URL : "https://github.com/rstudio/profvis/issues/89" TITLE : pandoc.exe: out of memory BODY : this issue has been asked but i'd like to have it emerged since it doesn't look like an uncommon issue. profvis {runapp path_to_app , display.mode = normal } the app takes a few hundred mb memory, but pandoc.exe takes more and more memory until a point it crashed due to the 2gb memory limit. is there a solution to this? why does pandoc.exe take so much memory? thanks, victor
