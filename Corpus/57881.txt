 URL : "https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/sheet-router/issues/78" TITLE : replace const with var BODY : the sheet-router npm package https://www.npmjs.com/package/sheet-router makes use of the const keyword. i guess it should be replaced with var before being packaged, no? i've had client errors cropping up on account of the const keyword, i suspect it's due to some browsers not treating it as lexically scoped.
