 URL : "https://github.com/weechat/weechat/issues/1010" TITLE : memory leak present on 1.8 BODY : i have my system configured so it spawns weechat on a terminal on login. i also have encrypted sec.info data, so when weechat starts, it asks me for the password. well, it happened me twice that, instead of giving the password, i just closed the terminal window directly because i didn't want to use weechat that time , and after few seconds 30-90s i start hearing the fan of my laptop like a turbine. i take a look at the temperatures and the cpu is at 90Âºc!! because the cpu is working at 100% load. i take a look at top and the processing eating that much cpu is weechat. so i kill it and it's all fixed, but what if i'm not there or i don't notice? :/ i don't know much about debug/debugging weechat, so please if you need some reports or something tell me. also, this doesn't happen all the time, so it'll be a little hard to reproduce i guess. if it helps, i did nothing fancy with my laptop, just turn it on, close weechat, ncmpcpp and htop terminal windows as they open on startup , and then i left the laptop like that. i didn't open anything or used any app.
