 URL : "https://github.com/Youshido/GraphQLBundle/issues/49" TITLE : how to implement security BODY : i'm trying to setup the security for the bundle. but i'm a bit confuse cause i don't succeed to find examples of use and the docs is not complete at all. i saw they were black/white list and voter. but how can i use it ? for example if i would like to handle access control on field of a type. for example a is a user and b is an admin. a can't access a certain field but b can cause he is admin ? i don't know if this is even possible at the moment with the bundle. and also does the bundle handle field deprecation in the type ? thanks for your answers !
