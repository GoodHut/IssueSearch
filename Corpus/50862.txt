 URL : "https://github.com/lyft/envoy-api/issues/76" TITLE : add config ack support BODY : for various reasons, envoy might be unable to accept a new config provided via a discovery service. the simplest case is semantically invalid. for this reason, it would be useful to provide an explicit acknowledgement of the currently active configuration. given the eventually consistent model, active has a somewhat fuzzy definition, but let's not worry too much about that now. likely implementation: grpc uses bi-di stream. rest provides the current generation in the next hanging request.
