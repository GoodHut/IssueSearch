 URL : "https://github.com/xolvio/chimp/issues/638" TITLE : cannot run single scenario BODY : it was possible to run a single scenario like so: chimp folder/file.feature:33 which would cause the scenario at line 33 of the file file.feature to run. after chimp 0.49 or similar probably after a cucumber update this no longer works and the whole feature file is always executed. also tried setting the scenario name like name= some scenario but it doesn't work either. can someone verify the problem and/or point me to an alternative to run scenarios from the command line? thank you!
