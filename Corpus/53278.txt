 URL : "https://github.com/scitran/core/issues/993" TITLE : disallow empty uploads BODY : allowing file-less uploads on reaper-focussed endpoints /upload/uid , /upload/label , /upload/reaper is unintended and needlessly complicates debugging of reaper tools. i suggest we stop allowing such empty uploads.
