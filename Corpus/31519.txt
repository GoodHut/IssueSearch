 URL : "https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/issues/368" TITLE : solo mining testnet BODY : i have set up the litecoin testnet locally on my computer, two nodes running connected to each other and no one else. i've downloaded cpuminer 2.5.0 minerd and run the following. minerd -a scrypt -o http://127.0.0.1:19333 -u username -p ghd8s7sw13yd -t 1 -d --no-stratum --no-longpoll --no-getwork --coinbase-addr=myp43yprrwodbzeb8chfqt7d53zyqdk71r however i get the following error. 2017-08-02 12:56:13 1 miner threads started, using 'scrypt' algorithm. 2017-08-02 12:56:13 http request failed: empty reply from server 2017-08-02 12:56:13 json_rpc_call failed, retry after 30 seconds contents of my conf file for the client i'm trying to mine against. 19333 is the default testnet rpc port so does not need to be specified. the other local client has a different p2p and rpc port so they do not clash but i'm not able to mine against that one either. rpcuser=username rpcpassword=ghd8s7sw13yd rpcallowip=127.0.0.1 rpcallowip=192.168.1.155 server=1 listen=1 daemon=1 run on the test network instead of the real bitcoin network. testnet=1 run a regression test network regtest=0 any ideas what i need to do to be able to cpu mine the testnet?
