 URL : "https://github.com/urish/firebase-server/issues/80" TITLE : cli fails to start BODY : after upgrading to version 0.9.0 i get the following error when trying to start the cli on macos sierra with node 6.5.0: $ node_modules/.bin/firebase-server -p 5555 env: node\r: no such file or directory i've looked into this a bit, and my guess is that it fails due to \r characters in the file. if i convert the file to unix format using e.g. unix2dos it works fine again. is it possible to fix this by e.g. republishing an updated build of the package? i'm not really well versed in how the npm registry works.
