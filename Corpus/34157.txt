 URL : "https://github.com/loicteixeira/gj-unity-api/issues/83" TITLE : bump minimum version BODY : so far, the minimum version to use the api is unity 5.0.1 as of v2.1.0 https://github.com/loicteixeira/gj-unity-api/releases/tag/v2.1.0 which means the package has to be generated with unity 5.0.1 . it's probably not necessary to support that far back and could probably be bumped to something more recent. unity 2017 maybe?
