 URL : "https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban/issues/1984" TITLE : ip6tables not initialized BODY : in the 0.11 branch, in the file config/action.d/iptables-common.conf an section exists to address the ipv6 variant of i-tables: init?family=inet6 option: blocktype ipv6 note: this is what the action does with rules. this can be any jump target as per the iptables man page section 8 . common values are drop reject, reject --reject-with icmp6-port-unreachable values: string blocktype = reject --reject-with icmp6-port-unreachable option: iptables ipv6 notes.: actual command to be executed, including common to all calls options values: string iptables = ip6tables <lockingopt> but i don't know how to make use of it. when starting fail2ban, i just see that actionstart is executed for iptables. ip6tables remain uninitialized. could you pls give me a hint how to make use of the inet6 family? thanks.
