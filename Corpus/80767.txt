 URL : "https://github.com/johnyf/omega/issues/5" TITLE : update the documentation BODY : as of a808dc1a5b02d451ddce6e33640562f00a2a4771, doc.md is about to start becoming outdated: - the viewpoint has now shifted to untyped logic: describe role of refinement mappings. - first-order logic is directly available in omega.symbolic.fol : explain how to use it. - describe enumeration of symbolic entities. - the cumbersome unidirectional two-stage building of omega.symbolic.symbolic.automaton will be replaced, by subclassing from fol.context . - de-emphasize enumerated transition systems and automata . - demonstrate streett and rabin solvers via examples strategies, counter-strategies . - mini howto for fixpoint computations.
