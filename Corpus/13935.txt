 URL : "https://github.com/skuroda/Sublime-AdvancedNewFile/issues/166" TITLE : a lot of problems BODY : hi! thank you very much for this plugin, i think it really cool, because there are around 700 stars and 81 forks. but, my persanal user experience with it not very good. there are a lot of problems in my case.... everywhere. here they are: 1. default file extension doesn't work for me. that's what i have currently: { default_extension : txt } i also tried default_extension : .txt with dot befire txt but still doesn't work. 2. use_cursor_text : true doesn't work if there are no text in first line. also, i think it should take the text around my cursor as file name. hm, but instead of it, it always try to take the first line of the file. 3. just noticed now, new strange problem. currently i have blank user preference file, but it still takes first line of file as file name. 4. default path also doesn't work. i use sublime text ver. 3, build 3126, on windows 7 32 bit. i have no problems with any of another extensions, there are all work like a charm. when i tested advancednewfile, i disabled all of another extensions . it will be a good thing, i think, to post somewhere on the top of readme.md completely workable user preferences preset.
