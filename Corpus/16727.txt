 URL : "https://github.com/Wynncraft/Issues/issues/8658" TITLE : logging in glitch BODY : so i logged it to a normal server, my armor and accesories glitched thinking that i dont have enough skillpoints so it dropped on the floor, i was grinding so my inventory was full, then the server restarted. because of that i lost a cancer,vaward,morph steel and my hiveboots+ diamond fusion. can i have them back or can you atleast fix it?
