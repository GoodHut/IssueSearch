 URL : "https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/issues/1874" TITLE : detect documentation bugs BODY : issue details since the documentation is not inline for all packages, we should guarantee that documented header and real headers are the same. for example, we document include <cgal/io/output_surface_facets_to_off.h> for cgal::output_surface_facets_to_off while this header does not exist the real header is cgal/io/complex_2_in_triangulation_3_file_writer.h - the simple thing we can do it to update test_merge_of_branches to check that any header in doc/pkg/cgal exists. there might be false positive if the header is not in the package but i'm pretty sure we can workaround these. - the second part of this issue is to fix the errors
