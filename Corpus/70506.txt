 URL : "https://github.com/OpenDICOMweb/sdk/issues/56" TITLE : well known uid subtypes BODY : _from @jfphilbin on september 20, 2016 15:10_ create classes for each subtype of well known uids. for example: - transfersyntax - frameofreference - sopclass - serviceclass - sopinstance - ... the classes should be designed so that wkuid.lookup and e.g. transfersyntax.lookup return the same object if it is a transfer syntax. _copied from original issue: opendicomweb/core 39_
