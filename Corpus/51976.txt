 URL : "https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle/issues/2292" TITLE : c++ full include paths BODY : our include convention is that if a header file is in the same directory as the source file, we don't have to specify the full include path. for example, if a.h , b.h , z.h , and a.cc are in the same directory paddle/pserver , we'd write the following in a.cc : cpp include a.h include b.h include z.h include paddle/math/matrix.h include paddle/utils/stringprint.h however, most auto format tools emacs plugins, clang-format, etc sort header paths enclosed in double-quotes . this is reasonable because it 1. allows us to find included header files efficiently in the alphabetical order, and 1. keep header files in the same directory package staying together. however, the sorting would reformat our code as: cpp include a.h include b.h include paddle/math/matrix.h include paddle/utils/stringprint.h include z.h where a.h and z.h are no longer staying together, even if they are in the same directory. so, i propose here that we always write full include paths. if so, we'd have cpp include paddle/pserver/a.h include paddle/math/matrix.h include paddle/pserver/b.h include paddle/pserver/z.h include paddle/utils/stringprint.h
