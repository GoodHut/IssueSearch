 URL : "https://github.com/mozilla/network-pulse/issues/294" TITLE : pulse v2 launch meta BODY : hi team. we are on the final stretch to launch our new build. we will need this ready for the network launch. let's aim for jan 31 to production, so we have time to qa and squash bugs. the work seems manageable, but there's risk from conflicting priorities. meta tasks below. tried to order them logically. i'm on mobile. can someone link relevant issues? 1. finish tests 1. prep and import data 1. connect frontend to backend. how many dev days do we expect? 1. build form - design spec done, but there is error handling to wrangle. expect this to take non-trivial time. 1. add quality analytics 1. favs - persist for users with auth. this feature shouldn't block launch. we can bump. anything missing from this list? later: 1. revisit back button
