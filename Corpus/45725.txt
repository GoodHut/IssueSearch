 URL : "https://github.com/romainbrette/holypipette/issues/1" TITLE : initialization of ob1 BODY : - currently the python path of the ob1 module elveflow64.py is specified within ob1.py. this is not good! - there different aspects of configuration that are hardcoded in the script and should instead be in a configuration file, in a readable form eg types of channels, serial number etc . - the folder for saving the calibration is currently the home user's directory. maybe not so good.
