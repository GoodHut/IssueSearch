 URL : "https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/23198" TITLE : improve searchbar examples BODY : you show a few very nice searchbar examples here https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/input-group/ . however it seems like the buttons are a little bit higher than the search bar. it is not noticeable because of the white background, but once you change the background color one can see it's not very clean. url https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/input-group/ original example: http://i.imgur.com/5aqd5pe.png with dark background: http://i.imgur.com/yu0cqhx.png
