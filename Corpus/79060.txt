 URL : "https://github.com/olahol/iso-3166-2.js/issues/21" TITLE : return falsey on failure BODY : both subdivision and country return an empty object on failure ie, when they aren't able to find a country / subdivision based on the input . in normal javascript, you could just test any field to know whether your request worked: let sub = iso3166.subdivision us-in ; if sub.code { // ... } in typescript, this is nearly impossible to do cleanly since the compiler doesn't want you touching code , which may or may not be set , and it might cause problems for other javascript variants as well. it would be much cleaner if these functions returned a falsey value false, null, undefined, ... on failure. testing for safety would then look like this: let sub = iso3166.subdivision se-o ; if sub { // ... } this change would cause existing code to throw typeerror, but be far cleaner in the long run.
