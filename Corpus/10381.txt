 URL : "https://github.com/canjs/canjs/issues/3277" TITLE : canjs 3.âˆž epic BODY : a collection of issues for the next big release of canjs. this release will hopefully not break 3.x compatibility, but will represent a sizable change in how we build apps. i feel like it will include the following: 1. can-element 2. new templating engine s probably supporting jsx and something stream-compatible . 3. improvements to can-connect and can-set 4. decorators that add observability and other cool features to viewmodels and models based around direct class expressions. 5. viewmodels that only derive from streams.
