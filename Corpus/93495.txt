 URL : "https://github.com/roots/docs/issues/69" TITLE : add warning about ecryptfs BODY : i think it would be nice if the docs mentioned on installing-trellis that the project directory must not be in an ecryptfs directory. ecryptfs is used if the encrypt my home folder option is selected during a ubuntu install. in that case, any directory outside /home should work. see more info at https://github.com/roots/trellis/issues/738
