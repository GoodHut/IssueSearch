 URL : "https://github.com/Friend-LGA/LGSideMenuController/issues/89" TITLE : round corners on rootview BODY : i would like to add round corners to the root view only when the leftviewcontroller is showing see attachment 1 . i've been advised to use : sidemenucontroller.rootviewcontainer.layer.cornerradius = 8.0 which didn't do anything. i tried using the following code instead and the result was half way of what was desired see attachments 2 & 3 : rootviewcontainer?.cornerradius = 8.0 issues : - the round corners appear on the root view even when no side-menu is showing - when we expand the side-menu, we see a black bg behind the rounded corners if this could be fixed, it would be great. thank you! ! attachment1 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/22631216/23111221/1c185c18-f6f5-11e6-8b3b-24c1a96f5c50.jpg ! attachment2 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/22631216/23111222/1c1924e0-f6f5-11e6-8cb5-52650f0304da.png ! attachment3 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/22631216/23111223/1c195e10-f6f5-11e6-8641-17cb61c58de8.png
