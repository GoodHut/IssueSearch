 URL : "https://github.com/SamBlaise/perceptron_cpp/issues/1" TITLE : perceptron has to learn BODY : hi samuel, good job with your perceptron implementation. i have tested to run my perceptron only for one training cycle and test is afterwards. i got the same result in terms as performance as you : train on 60000 samples, test on 10000 samples. learning epoch 1/1 ..... 9.94666666667 % error rate in 60000 samples test data set ..... 9.98 % error rate in 10000 samples if i run more training cycle, the performance of with the training set improves considerably. however, the performance with the test set only improves to 8 % error rate after 500 training cycles. the performance during training should also improve in your implementation, if things are done correctly. do you maybe initiate every time a new weight vector w? cheers, michael
