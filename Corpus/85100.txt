 URL : "https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-plugin/issues/1401" TITLE : ens address not resolving BODY : not sure if i'm doing this right with ens, but it didn't seem to work. ! image https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/636551/25859271/42e6a366-349b-11e7-9bb9-de5847209207.png i've tried a few other combinations like rilxxlir and rilxxlir.eth . same response. the owner and resolver were defined for this. https://etherscan.io/enslookup?q=rilxxlir.eth i am running metamask 3.6.3 in chrome. it looks like ens support was added in 3.5.0, but maybe not? or maybe the ens main resolver address isn't entered into the plugin yet?
