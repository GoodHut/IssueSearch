 URL : "https://github.com/nservant/HiC-Pro/issues/77" TITLE : group order in plots BODY : the groups are not ordered in the bar graphs such that the color and text match up. i'm attaching a few examples. i am using ggplot2 version 2.2.1 i just installed hicpro today. my collaborator ran hicpro on the same data on a different computer with an older installation and did not see the same problem. thanks for this great tool and any help you can offer! plothiccontactranges_jt_test.pdf https://github.com/nservant/hic-pro/files/823438/plothiccontactranges_jt_test.pdf plotmapping_jt_test.pdf https://github.com/nservant/hic-pro/files/823439/plotmapping_jt_test.pdf
