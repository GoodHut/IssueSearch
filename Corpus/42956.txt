 URL : "https://github.com/genderkit/genderkit/issues/7" TITLE : change citation style BODY : we're currently using jekyll-scholar to provide citations on many of our articles. currently we're using all the details, which means citations appear in author-date format in the text, like this: clarke, 2017 . i'm not sure this is the best way to do this, both from the point of view of making it readable to a non-academic audience, and also for screen reader users. we need to find out if possible what the most accessible way of doing citations is, and then switch over to using that. if we can't find any information about this, we need to switch to using superscript numbers.
