 URL : "https://github.com/Piwigo/Piwigo/issues/648" TITLE : cli for piwigo BODY : it would be great if piwigo offered a script that can be used in a cronjob i.e. cli for piwigo . this would e.g. be helpful for the e-mail notifications about new updates. i use piwigo for my family only so the site is not visited very frequently. another use case could be to automatically sync albums and do some other administrative tasks.
