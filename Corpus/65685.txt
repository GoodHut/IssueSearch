 URL : "https://github.com/kframework/k/issues/2310" TITLE : kdoc not working in 4.0 BODY : using kdoc on the examples included with the download doesn't seem to be working. in k/tutorial/1_k/1_lambda/lesson_1 i tried: > kompile lambda.k > kdoc --format html --debug -v parse command line options = 12 no html files are generated. i get similar results if i omit the --format option. also, running: > kdoc lambda.k has the same effect. i am on macos sierra, but trying it on windows 10 produces the same result. am i doing something wrong with kdoc?
