 URL : "https://github.com/Martinsos/9gag-autoscroll/issues/8" TITLE : create a gh-pages page BODY : by creating a gh-page, i could solve multiple problems: 1. hosting of js code. instead of publishing it on release branch from where it is very difficult to host it, i could have it as a file hosted on gh-page. 2. having a nicer way to copy the bookmarklet code. in readme.md i can not create an image in a link with a href that is javascript:... because github camouflages such links, but i could do it easily on gh-page i believe.
