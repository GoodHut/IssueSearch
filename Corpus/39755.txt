 URL : "https://github.com/equitablegrowth/VZ_historicalminwage/issues/3" TITLE : state data pre-2000s BODY : this is an extremely helpful resource, thank you! before i learned about this, i was using this table from the department of labor https://www.dol.gov/whd/state/stateminwagehis.htm the dol table seems to have a bit more variability in the state minimum wage value than what is here. for example, in 1992, dol has at least 19 states that have different minimum wages from the federal. the data here has 8. dol says that data comes from the book of states. do you have a sense of whether that source is reliable?
