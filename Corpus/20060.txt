 URL : "https://github.com/sdllc/Basic-Excel-R-Toolkit/issues/62" TITLE : bert crashes excel BODY : when i try to open excel after installing bert, excel crashes after a few seconds of use; the one useful error message i did get was something about the libraries not being compiled for bert. the tool ribbon also does not appear. i wish there were more details to provide but would appreciate any thoughts on how to resolve the issue.
