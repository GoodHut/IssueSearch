 URL : "https://github.com/TRIQS/triqs/issues/393" TITLE : hdf5 - mac os BODY : i'm trying to install triqs on my macos x el capitan for the first time. i ran through the installation process as described via homebrew on the website. i've noticed that my two versions of hdf5 are not compatible so i tried to see if i take out the compatibility check from the setup if the code can compile and work. it did compile but i got the following error during the test: the following tests failed: 167 - operator_python2 failed 169 - gf_init failed 170 - gf_base_op failed 173 - dos failed 174 - pade failed 179 - block_matrix failed 180 - gf_tensor_valued failed 181 - histograms failed 182 - multivar failed 183 - g_k_om failed 184 - block2 failed 185 - wrap_a failed 188 - wrap_multivar failed errors while running ctest make: test error 8 i then tried to change hid_t to int and then to int64_t in this file 4 triqs/python_tools/converters/h5.hpp but the same issues appeared. is there any solution to this at the moment?
