 URL : "https://github.com/Xtraball/SiberianCMS/issues/387" TITLE : rss feed view error BODY : as of the version 4.12.0 i detect an error in the rss. the list of rss items is loaded well but when trying to view one of the items the error occures. the error is at line 83 of the rss factory where the item is filtered from the entire collection. so doing some test i detect the flowing is hapening: 1. when the collection is loaded first time by the rsslistcontroller the data.collection is set to the $scope.collection and the list view renderes without any problem. 2. next in this process the $scope.collection is copied into the rss.collection at this point no undefined items in the array 3. than the data.cover is added to the first position in the array, but without checking if the data.cover is empty. this causes the first item in the rss.collection to be undefined . 4. when from the rssviewcontroller then loading a feed the rss.getfeed .. is called 5. in the rss.getfeed then a search in the rss.collection is performed, but the first item in the rss.collection array then is empty causing an error and ending up breaking the call leaving the user with an emptty unrendered view. so my sugestion is to fix this bug in the rss.js file in the rsslistcontroller : replace line 21 from rss.collection.unshift angular.copy data.cover ; to if data.cover { rss.collection.unshift angular.copy data.cover ; }
