 URL : "https://github.com/damianxd/homebridge-vera/issues/112" TITLE : mapping device types? BODY : for the most part this works wonderfully, but i have one crazy issue: i have something like 40 z-wave switches. almost everything is mapped to a light device type in homekit. some of them aren't really lights, like my pool filter pump, and my fireplace. some fans are also on appliance modules. the problem: siri sometimes doesn't hear me correctly when i say 'turn the livingroom light on . sometimes she just hears turn the light on . and then all holy automation hell breaks loose. my fireplace turns on, my pool pump kicks on, and one by one every single light in my house turns on. i see this as a homekit deficiency i really should be able to tell siri what unqualified light should mean based on the context of where the device is located . in the meantime, it would be great if i could map devices to hap device types in the config file... heck anything other than a light would be sufficient!
