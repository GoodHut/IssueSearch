 URL : "https://github.com/Mensen/ept_TFCE-matlab/issues/13" TITLE : maximum number of channels BODY : dear armand, thank you for your great work, the speed of the mex implementation is simply astonishing. i'd like to run tfce on connectivity measures in source space 624 voxels , with no time dimension and 33 frequency bands, i.e. a 389376 x 33 array, with the neighbourhood created manually. matlab crashes when i try this however, with the matlab has encountered an internal problem and needs to close message. the crash report should be attached. crash_report.txt https://github.com/mensen/ept_tfce-matlab/files/1500406/crash_report.txt this starts to happen at about 300 x 300 x 33 arrays 200 x 200 x 33 still works . i've compiled the mex files with mingw64 / gcc, and the problem is identical on both a windows and a linux machine. i tried the -largearraydims option but this produces a few compile warnings and always returns a matrix of zeros. in any case the crash happens even when compiling with this option. is there any fix to the c code that i maybe could try? thanks! best, mircea
