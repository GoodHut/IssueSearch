 URL : "https://github.com/yifanlu/usbmc/issues/2" TITLE : fails to mount usb BODY : hey, i'm having mounting issues on startup. i'm using the launch release of enso henkaku and after adding usbmc to the config on ur0, the pstv now powers on the usb device on startup in my case, a usb micro sd adapter but does not mount it as ux0 uses the memory card instead . also note sure if this is relevant but i've always needed to un-plug and re-plug this adapter into the pstv, while in vitashell, to get it to power on and mount on regular henkaku .
