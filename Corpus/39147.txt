 URL : "https://github.com/yadakhov/insert-on-duplicate-key/issues/12" TITLE : return affected rows BODY : would it be possible to somehow grab the number of rows affected? at the moment all the methods return a bool whereas i'd like to know if an insert was actually done or ignored. it would be easy to use laravel's affectingstatement method, but that would change the api of your code. would it be possible to make this breaking change and bump the version number? or possibly save the number of affected rows and add a method to grab that value. i should be able to do the work if you like.
