 URL : "https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/issues/7190" TITLE : marlin with anet a8 BODY : i have been using skynet but would really like to use marlin so there is no middle man. is this wrong? also because marlin doesn't need a special arduino ide to run it. so the only problem i seem to be having with the very latest marlin on the a8 is after it homes then levels the bed.. then... rather than going on a down trajectory towards the bed, it stays at the z level it was at when it finished with the bed level routine. it tries to print from the wrong z level. if i am on the wrong forum or this is a contentious issue, i apologize profusely. i am so close to making it work! thanks again!
