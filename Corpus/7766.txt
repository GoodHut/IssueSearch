 URL : "https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-unit-testing-example/issues/27" TITLE : ionic 3 support BODY : i had an existing ionic 2.4.8, and followed the tutorial by @roblouie to add unit tests. which worked great. i'm in the process of upgrading to ionic 3, using the changelog steps https://github.com/driftyco/ionic/blob/master/changelog.md steps-to-upgrade . i've followed it, step by step but unit tests are now broken. i see you have a pull request https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-unit-testing-example/pull/26 by @mtechde. is this master branch going to work with ionic 3.x? i can't find the branch for ionic 3 package.json version and file changes.
