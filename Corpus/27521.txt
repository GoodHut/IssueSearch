 URL : "https://github.com/agalakhov/xiccd/issues/12" TITLE : desktop file issues BODY : while preparing an updated debian package for 0.2.4, i found the following issues: - upstream autoconf installs the .desktop file to /usr/share/applications , not /etc/xdg/autostart . is that intentional? that's contrary to what the manpage suggests and would mean that xiccd can only be invoked manually, right? - encoding is deprecated by freedesktop https://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/1.1/apc.html and needs to be dropped lintian's desktop-entry-contains-encoding-key https://lintian.debian.org/tags/desktop-entry-contains-encoding-key.html - instead of using onlyshowin=xfce;mate;lxde; we could use notshowin=gnome;kde; lintian's desktop-entry-limited-to-environments https://lintian.debian.org/tags/desktop-entry-limited-to-environments.html - lintian thinks that no main categories are being used but additional are desktop-entry-lacks-main-category https://lintian.debian.org/tags/desktop-entry-lacks-main-category.html . i think we can just drop the empty categories= line? - finally, lintian complains about the lack of keywords and icon , but i think these may be quite useless for the case of a non-menu .desktop file that's only used for autostart.
