 URL : "https://github.com/KonradIT/goprowifihack/issues/77" TITLE : control over bluetooth BODY : have you explored the option of controlling gopro cameras over bluetooth? is it actually possible? the information https://www.reddit.com/r/gopro/comments/2isk3d/gopro_hero_4_bluetooth_connectivity_only_works/ i'm finding suggests this is only possible on ios to pair the devices, after which the camera is controlled via wifi. i'm not willing to believe they've wasted the bluetooth radio for that. thoughts?
