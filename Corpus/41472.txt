 URL : "https://github.com/Cannonb4ll/LaravelFtp/issues/3" TITLE : 512 kb download limit BODY : is there a reason for hardcoding this limit value in the package? if $sizefile > 512000 { // 512 000 kb return 'this file is too big to read, maximum filesize allowed to the browser: 512kb'; } else { if @ftp_fget $this->connection, $temphandle, $file, $this->mode, 0 { rewind $temphandle ; $total = stream_get_contents $temphandle ; return $total; } else { return false; } it would be great if this limit could be changed by the user from config or initiating connection method.
