 URL : "https://github.com/lindegroup/autopkgr/issues/590" TITLE : autopkg not installed BODY : just trying autopkgr for the first time. i have been using autopkg for a year or two. when i launch autopkgr is says that autopkg is not installed, which i know it is v1.0.2 . if i click to install autopkg from the autppkgr interface it asks for my credentials then runs through the process of installing autopkg and says installation is complete. then the autopkgr interface still shows as autopkg not being installed. i can run autopkg from the command line, so i know it is working and installed correctly. any advice here? thanks, scott
