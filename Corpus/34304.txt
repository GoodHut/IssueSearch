 URL : "https://github.com/negativetwelve/react-native-ux-cam/issues/35" TITLE : can't use on android BODY : hi, i'm having issues trying to use the module. it builds fine but if i console.log uxcam in react-native after importing uxcam it returns {}. strangely, if i change uxcam.js to export the class uxcam instead of the instance new uxcam , console.log uxcam returns a function. if i try to instantiate it there, it also returns an empty object. is there something going on with the class export? also, i've noticed console.log nativemodules in react-native returns an empty object, but console.log nativemodules.rnuxcam returns object object in uxcam.js, if that helps.
