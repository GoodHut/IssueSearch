 URL : "https://github.com/JakubOnderka/PHP-Parallel-Lint/issues/103" TITLE : check only changed files BODY : hello, i think we could add the option --only-git-changed . this option will force an analysis only on the changed files. this is just an idea. i don't know if this feature is possible for php-parallel-lint. library https://github.com/m6web/coke does this feature. thanks, best regards, vincent chataignier
