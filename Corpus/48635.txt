 URL : "https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/10756" TITLE : shader time in editor BODY : operating system or device, godot version, gpu model and driver if graphics related : ubuntu 17.04 - godot v3.0.alpha.custom_build.3ae1cff i don't think it's desirable to have the time variable behave in editor as i'm game. there's two options either turn off time in editor or have a way to reset the time to 0 through a button or something. i think 2nd option would be better for users
