 URL : "https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels/issues/3587" TITLE : tests for var and svar? BODY : before trying to implement anything new in these areas, i'm trying to get the test coverage up so i can confidently avoid creative destruction. the biggest untested blocks i see are svar_model.svarresults.sirf_errband_mc , along with var_model.varresults.irf_errband_mc . are there canonical examples i can use to write tests against?
