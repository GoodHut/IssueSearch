 URL : "https://github.com/angr/vex/issues/11" TITLE : new instructions for vex? BODY : hello guys, a short question for vex. we're dealing a lot with mach-o files, so basically arm64 and we often stumble upon instructions which can not be decoded. is it already possible to add new instructions to libvex or are their still problems with compiling vex for pyvex? if it is, where to start digging into this - if not, where are the problems and what has to be solved? being able to add new instructions is going to be one of the core features needed looking into the future. best regards, andreas
