 URL : "https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/5255" TITLE : phantom game downloads BODY : your system information steam client version build number or date : november 25 distribution e.g. ubuntu : ubuntu 16.04 opted into steam client beta?: yes and no issue present on both have you checked for system updates?: yes please describe your issue in as much detail as possible: describe what you _expected_ should happen and what _did_ happen. please link any large code pastes as a github gist https://gist.github.com/ for about a month now, every time i open steam, around 10 or more games have updates in the downloads tab. however, most or all haven't recently been updated according to the games' websites and only a couple show as needing updates in the library tab. i am able to play the games with phantom updates without updating first, but the games with actual updates require me to update before playing. i launch steam every few days, so having 10 updates every time doesn't make sense. the phantom updates are 0 kb in size. this issue originated on beta, but i disabled beta for a few launches/days and the problem persists. i have tried clearing the download cache, to no avail. many updates in downloads: ! many updates https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5740967/33233291-7d35764e-d1c8-11e7-8fb9-0eb78add6288.png only 3 updates shown in library: ! only 3 updates shown in library https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5740967/33233293-7ecb87fa-d1c8-11e7-9255-79bb92f18954.png unsure if it's related, but i am also getting logged out every day or two. i have reported this in the appropriate thread. steps for reproducing this issue: 1. launch steam. 2. check downloads page.
