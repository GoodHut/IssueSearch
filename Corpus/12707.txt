 URL : "https://github.com/Shopify/measured/issues/60" TITLE : remove base unit BODY : we define base unit without a value, then a unit value: 'other unit' . explore if we can remove the base altogether. building the parse graph may be more complex, but we can experiment with just processing them in order and not depending on a base. this may help us with 59 that don't share a common zero point, and simply express units relative to other units.
