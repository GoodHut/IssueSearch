 URL : "https://github.com/plumi/plumi.app/issues/1015" TITLE : festivals content item BODY : reported by anonymous on 11 jul 2007 09:38 utc add a festivals content type into plumi. this would have these fields: festival name description locations can add as many as necessary - sub-field of date range for each location videos either video objects, or simply name, description, year produced for those not uploaded to the site submissions - this needs to be fleshed out, but objects generated by an online form filled out by members.. members can upload a video and submit it to various festivals for approval each festival would generate it's own rss2 vodcast. this ticket needs further discussion.
