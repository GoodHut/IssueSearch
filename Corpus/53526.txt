 URL : "https://github.com/swindon-rs/swindon/issues/12" TITLE : dynamic routing take 1 BODY : as the step one we just fetch addresses from external source: http-destinations: my-application: addresses: !jsonrequest verwalter/v1/schedule?key=data.roles.my-application.all_backends verwalter: addresses: - localhost:8379 more comprehensive settings might look like: htttp-destinations: my-application: addresses: !jsonrequest url: verwalter/v1/schedule?key=data.roles.my-application.all_backends refresh-interval: 10 technically, as we support changing addresses on the fly anyway this should be relatively easy to implement. /cc @popravich
