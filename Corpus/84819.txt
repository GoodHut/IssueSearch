 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-Azure/issues/31" TITLE : documentdb needs updating BODY : currently i am using 1.18 but unable to run the project because botbilder.azure is dependant on 1.11 that is quite a good few more than 10 major releases and patches behind. i don't want to have to downgrade the whole project, just to get table storage logging. and cant seem to remove the un-needed table storage, as again, the whole thing is stuck on being well behind and dependant. any idea if this project is still alive and going to be updated? ta
