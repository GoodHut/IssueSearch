 URL : "https://github.com/ZeroK-RTS/Zero-K/issues/2165" TITLE : check/fix slow vs features BODY : slow damage should not damage wrecks. in effect this means that the units with mixed slow/normal damage should damage wrecks less by the appropriate amount. this is a difficult ticket to solve since default damage is dealt to both shields and wrecks and the default damage is already configured to work well against shields. perhaps this is a rule that can be changed in armordefs? does featurepredamaged exist? solving this ticket would allow racketeer, thunderbird and cutter ? to no longer technically deal emp damage which hardcodedly doesn't damage wrecks and would possibly fix racketeer unit ai.
