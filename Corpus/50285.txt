 URL : "https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs/issues/2590" TITLE : wms versions mismatch BODY : i'm not sure yet if this is a terriajs or a server side problem. but i've observed a non expected behaviour of terriajs interacting with our server. terriajs interrogates our server with the following wms getcapabilities request: http://gsky-test.nci.org.au/ows?service=wms&request=getcapabilities&version=1.3.0&tiled=true as far as i can understand the server responds with a xml document stating that wms is version 1.3.0 but then, terriajs sends requests using wms 1.1.1 as this one: http://gsky.nci.org.au/ows?time=2017-03-06t00%3a00%3a00.000z&srs=epsg%3a3857&transparent=true&format=image%2fpng&exceptions=application%2fvnd.ogc.se_xml&styles=&tiled=true&feature_count=101&service=wms&version=1.1.1&request=getmap&layers=global%3atotalcover&bbox=0%2c0%2c5009377.085697312%2c5009377.085697312&width=256&height=256 i'd like to know if this change between versions is related to terriajs or a consequence of a problem in the returned getcapabilities document.
