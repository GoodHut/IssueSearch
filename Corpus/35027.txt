 URL : "https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-java/issues/1597" TITLE : custom log enhancers BODY : com.google.cloud.logging.logginghandler allows enhancer classes to be configured to augment created logentry & monitoredresource instances. the enhancer interface is package-private, preventing the implementation of custom enhancers unless one resorts to putting their third-party enhancer implementation in the com.google.cloud.logging package . as there's only a single enhancer implementation shipped with the library gaeflexloggingenhancer , this makes the entire enhancer functionality not terribly useful. is this intentional or simply an oversight?
