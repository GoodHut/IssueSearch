 URL : "https://github.com/ParadiseSS13/Paradise/issues/7948" TITLE : pda messenger exploit. BODY : problem description : you are able to see syndicate cyborgs on the pda messenger list. what did you expect to happen : to not be able to discover a possibly covert antagonist on the very public messenger list. what happened instead : the pda messenger list included syndicate cyborgs, revealing that there were in fact nuclear operatives. why is this bad/what are the consequences: this is a disgusting exploit to learn the presences or lack of nukies and/or syndicate cyborgs. it essentially ruins any potential stealth plans for nukies with no way to counter other than not getting cyborgs. steps to reproduce the problem : get a working pda, spawn a syndicate cyborg, look through the messenger list until you see the syndi borg's name listed.
