 URL : "https://github.com/LightsHope/server/issues/942" TITLE : onyxia attunement bug BODY : account name: gobeans character name: stinkmeaner realm: lightbringer pvp issue: a matter of months ago i was on the realm elysium doing the onyxia attunement quest chain and handed in the quest “abandoned hope“ to marshal maxwell in morgan's vigil. this enables the ability for a crumpled up note to drop from brd enemies. at this point i stopped playing for a few months until after the elysium>lightbringer transfer happened. now the problem is the item a crumpled up note will not drop for me after 50+ kills of the correct enemies even after deleting the wtf/wtb folders. players in game tell me they had it drop off the first 1-3 kills. it appears that the transfer reset my ability to receive the item. notes: -i have no quest for the chain in my log -i have checked all npc's that are involved in the entire quest chain and none of them have a quest. including marshal windsor p.s. a gm response sent me here.
