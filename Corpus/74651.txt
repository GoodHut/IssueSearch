 URL : "https://github.com/golang/go/issues/20514" TITLE : false positive on go vet BODY : please answer these questions before submitting your issue. thanks! what version of go are you using go version ? go version go1.6.4 linux/amd64 what operating system and processor architecture are you using go env ? goos= linux goarch= amd64 what did you do? ran go vet <filename> code looks like: log.printf foo: %s , whatever replacing with whatever.string solves the issue, but is unnecessarily verbose. what did you expect to see? no error. what did you see instead? resources/foo.go:180: arg whatever for printf verb %s of wrong type: foo.whatever the particularly strange thing is that the code is correct, and compiles and runs perfectly, however we get the warning from go vet, however not all cases are picked up. some work without warning, and others don't. the go-nuts folks agreed this was an issue, but nobody knows if it was reported yet. it should be fairly easy to know if there is a string string or fmt.stringer declared. thanks!
