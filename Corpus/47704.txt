 URL : "https://github.com/tripack45/VE280-Notes/issues/2" TITLE : problems about week 5 BODY : there're some problems about rc week 5. first, in puzzle 0, about vla actually variable length arrays https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/variable-length.html is a feature in iso-c99 , and is fully supported by gcc since gcc 0.9 status of c99 features in gcc http://gcc.gnu.org/c99status.html . though in iso-c11, it is relegated to a conditional feature which implementations are not required to support. in g++, you may use it after enabling a plugin. i know that using vla is not recommended due to various issues, but really works by the test on ideone http://ideone.com/5demp1 . so i think you should correct both c++ and c choose not to support this language feature above code won't compile second, about puzzle 2 on gcc documentation about optimization url , i found that > -o0 > reduce compilation time and make debugging produce the expected results. this is the default. so i can understand why enabling o1 would make the function work according to your explanations. however, strange things happened in my gcc. no matter how i try the optimization modes o0/o1/og/... or add a varible y , or try the debug mode, the program keeps printing 225 on my computer.
