 URL : "https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/issues/2928" TITLE : docker add tiles server BODY : this is to stake out a place for the upcoming pr with further enhancing of docker infrastructure - adding a tiles server , because currently we don't have one. let me briefly describe what we have now and what i'm doing. currently we use the following containers: db - with postgis import - with osm2pgsql kosmtik - with nodejs, kosmtik, carto, python and fonts. they currently live in the root directory but after finishing works on 2913 2914 they will hopefully reside in the docker/ subdirectory making the mess in the root directory a bit less overwhelming : . while these facilities are enough for developing styles, we can't do one simple thing: serve tiles for whatever software takes them, including for example web applications or qgis. there's one more thing we can't do atm: print maps using nik4 for example, but this is a topic for another discussion. so the idea is to create one more image to run a container with tiles server: tiles - with apache 2 and mod_tile/renderd thinking about the contents of this image makes it obvious that it shouldn't depend on the kosmtik container but since it uses the same set of fonts it's imagined that fonts should be shared between these two containers via a separate fonts volume. another thing to consider - is how to cache renderd tiles. i think a new volume should be introduced for that. there are other things to think about. soon i'll post a pr and we can see at how it works and organized.
