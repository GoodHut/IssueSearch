 URL : "https://github.com/weecology/PortalData/issues/143" TITLE : plant quadrat column name BODY : should we change 'quadrat' to 'stake' in the portal_plant_quadrats.csv? there was some confusion last time we mass-entered data because the column name on the physical data sheet is 'stake'. changing this would also bring the plant data in line with the rodent and ant data, both of which have 'stake' columns.
