 URL : "https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight-configurator/issues/392" TITLE : two new osd fonts... BODY : i made two different font for the internal osd. the first is a extralage font, i looks like the ezosd font. i found it some years ago, i don't know where the file came from. i modified it to fit betaflight osd. the second one is from me. i tried a betaflight font but is very small. i don't think its good for flying. ! btfl_extralarge https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16404343/21986870/809eb43e-dc01-11e6-84c9-9394816654a8.png btfl_extralarge.zip https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight-configurator/files/708661/btfl_extralarge.zip ! btfl_btfont https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16404343/21986871/80a16c6a-dc01-11e6-9586-980448cd6db2.png btfl_btfont.zip https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight-configurator/files/708662/btfl_btfont.zip feel free to do what ever you like with the fonts. maybe someone would like to add them to the configurator.
