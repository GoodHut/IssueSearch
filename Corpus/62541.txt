 URL : "https://github.com/tardis-sn/tardis/issues/687" TITLE : configuration version 2 BODY : this is to collect and discuss all the changes that could be implemented in the configuration file syntax and would require a tardis_config_version bump due to backwards incompatibility with the current configuration schemata. feel free to edit adding ideas and/or comment on the existing ones. proposed: 1. _yaml implicit resolver for ranges_ related to but not the same as 679 instead of the long yaml black_body_sampling: start: 1 angstrom stop: 1000000 angstrom num: 1.e+6 in the config file one would write something like black_body_sampling: 1..1000000:1.e+6 angstrom which would be interpreted as start..stop :num unit and is much shorter. the only drawback is that you cannot specify e.g. start in meters and stop in angstrom which is probably an edgy case anyway.
