 URL : "https://github.com/Payum/Payum/issues/654" TITLE : paypal recurring payments BODY : hi, i'm following the docs for implementing paypal recurring payments and i'm getting that after creating the recurring payment profile and call sync action i always get a pending status. i see on sandbox paypal page that the payment is made a few seconds after i get the payment state, so my backend didn't know that the payment was finally successful. is there any way to solve this? thank you for the help in advance
