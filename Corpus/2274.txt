 URL : "https://github.com/mongoose-os-libs/arduino-adafruit-tsl2561/issues/1" TITLE : write c docs BODY : this lib has nice js docs, but sadly not so nice c docs. docs get rendered here: https://mongoose-os.com/docs/reference/api.html arduino-adafruit-tsl2561 could you please write c docs in include/mgos_arduino_adafruit_tsl2561.h , and also move include/tsl2561.h to src since it's not supposed to be used by the clients?
