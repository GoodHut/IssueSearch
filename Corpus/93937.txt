 URL : "https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/issues/2101" TITLE : automatically break locks? BODY : if borg terminates unexpectedly, the lock is left in place, which will prevent future automatic backups from working until the lock is removed. automatically issuing the break-lock command would be quite dangerous, but it seems that in the common case that the old lock was made by the same machine, it should be possible to directly check if the process that made it is still alive, and if not, the lock can safely be deleted. this would likely eliminate the need for break-lock in almost all cases.
