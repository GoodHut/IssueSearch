 URL : "https://github.com/nskins/goby/issues/73" TITLE : simple save feature BODY : one should be able to type 'save' and the game data will be saved to file. it should then be loaded automatically on normal startup. create two functions in lib/util.rb: 1. save_game player : this function will generate the json representation of the argument and write it to a file since it's simple for now, just name it player.txt , i guess . 2. load_game : this function reads the file player.txt and parses the json into a player object. it then returns the new player object to the function from which it was called. json: http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/json/rdoc/json.html files: https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/file.html there will be a little more work required for the automatic loading lib/main.rb and for the new default command 'save' lib/world_command.rb . also, just since i'm thinking of it, try to see if there's any way to detect faulty data that doesn't parse correctly during load_game . if this happens, catch the error, return nil, and then, in lib/main.rb, create the default player data which is specified by the programmer .
