 URL : "https://github.com/google/guava/issues/2782" TITLE : remove jsr305 dependency BODY : i tried to compile guava with java 9 and failed. the problem is the jsr305 dependency. it contains a package javax.annotation which conflicts with the same package in the java.base module javax.annotation.postconstruct annotation and others . java 9 is not released yet, but we can already start thinking what to do. is it possible to replace jsr305 annotations with similar annotations?
