 URL : "https://github.com/nullfunction/liquidsoap/issues/1" TITLE : does not run BODY : i am new to docker so it could be me. but, it seems broken. when i try and run this container, i get an error. docker logs <container> will spit out a single line: line 1, char 2 before / ; parse error! i am not sure if docker needs better logging or the container just isn't logging as it should or what. but that is very little to go on with zero documentation of the build.
