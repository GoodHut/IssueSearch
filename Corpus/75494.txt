 URL : "https://github.com/uber/horovod/issues/99" TITLE : horovod with tensorboard BODY : horovod does not seem to behave properly with tensorboard. during training, each gpu will write to the log directory when i run a for loop. is there a way to control such that only 1 gpu is writing to the log directory? below is a sample code python for epoch in range 100 : train_writer = tf.summary.filewriter logdir + '/train/{}'.format epoch , sess.graph for i in range 0, 10000, batch_size : d_batch_loss = sess.run d_loss g_batch_loss = sess.run g_loss x_g = sess.run x_fake writing generated image train_writer.add_summary x_g train_writer.close
