 URL : "https://github.com/Rabu932/PassMan/issues/13" TITLE : reminder update pop-ups BODY : from what i have understood currently we are pushing pop-ups when a password needs to be updated. however there may be cases in which multiple updates are necessary. pushing multiple pop-ups one after the other might not be a great idea. as an alternative we could create a list that holds the passwords that need to be updated and maybe push a signle pop-up that says there are passwords that need to be updated
