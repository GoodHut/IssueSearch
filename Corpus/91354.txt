 URL : "https://github.com/webjars/openseadragon/issues/6" TITLE : this repo is now obsolete BODY : with the latest openseadragon release the library is now available through bower and/or npm. i'd originally created this manual packaging for openseadragon, but it is possible to now just use the bower source for it. i've just triggered the deploy on the webjars site using the bower source and it seems to have worked fine. should this repo be deleted or a deprecation note be put in the readme?
