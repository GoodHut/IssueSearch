 URL : "https://github.com/ngrx/store/issues/463" TITLE : what exactly is a slice? BODY : hey, i am new to angular and especially ngrx, but i have built a working example with different components using ngrx/store counter and chat . i understood so far, the application state is cut into different pieces of states, i have a state defined for the counter and a state for the chat, both together is the application state. in my components, i select the corresponding properties and everything works fine. my question is: what exactly is a slice? is it a selected part of properties of a state or is it an emitted update of a selected state? hope somebody can explain it... greetings lukas scheerer
