 URL : "https://github.com/trailofbits/remill/issues/170" TITLE : fminv and fmaxv BODY : the semantics for fminv and fmaxv are incorrect in at least three ways: 1. when taking the min/max of a number and a nan, they should return the default nan value. 2. fminv should return the most negative version between +0 and -0 , i.e. -0 . 3. fmaxv should return the most positive version between +0 and -0 , i.e. +0 .
