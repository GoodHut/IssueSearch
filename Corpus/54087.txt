 URL : "https://github.com/dataversioncontrol/dvc/issues/359" TITLE : figshare integration ? BODY : not so much an issue than a feature suggestion. would there be an interest to interface the data storage part with figshare https://figshare.com ? they have a pretty extensive api doc https://docs.figshare.com/ . i'm very impressed with dvc, but for publication my institution has a very strong preference for putting the data on figshare -- and i think it's going to be true of a number of biology/physics/social science institutions. thanks for the great work anyway !
