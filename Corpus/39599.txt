 URL : "https://github.com/ahezard/nds-bootstrap/issues/133" TITLE : sm64ds sleep problem BODY : so on the latest commit as of writing this 06a4558 , putting the ds into sleep mode and letting the buh-bye! sound effect finish playing will cause the screens to be black when reopened. however, if you get into the options while the screen is still black and disable then enable the backlight, the screen will turn back on until you go into sleep mode again.
