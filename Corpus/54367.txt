 URL : "https://github.com/XAM-Consulting/SlideOverKit/issues/35" TITLE : fresh and slideoverkit BODY : i can only find a couple forum posts, but none give solution. how can i call a slidepopupview as in sample with popoverview , from the freshbasepagemodel, when i don't have the showmenu and other functions in the class menucontainerpage. i've tried to create my own menucontainerpage with a base of freshbasepagemodel but haven't been able to do it because the shoemenuaction is null when i attempt to call it assuming because that's part of the custom renderer. others describe using messaging, but i'm still not sure how to popup overtop of a model page. thank you for both freshmvvm and slideoverkit.
