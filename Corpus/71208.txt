 URL : "https://github.com/openresty/docker-openresty/issues/45" TITLE : add 1.11.2.4-stretch tag BODY : hi i see that you've recently added stretch support, congratulations and thank you for your hard work! however, most docker images based off of the openresty image should be tagged more specifically for compatibility reasons. i see that openresty doesn't use semver https://github.com/openresty/openresty/issues/168 which already makes it difficult to understand which images are non-breaking. all the more reason to use a specific tag.
