 URL : "https://github.com/Praqma/pretested-integration-plugin/issues/94" TITLE : fix workspace resolver BODY : there are two failing tests related to sum not being able to resolve the git workspace, if you have navigated into subdirectories. these issues have occurred before and have been fixed in these two issues: - https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/jenkins-25545 - https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/jenkins-25445 after we removed the build wrapper, the error occurred again, but this time it does not look like we can resolve it as before, since we relied on build wrapper specific methods. the error also happens in the post checkout step.
