 URL : "https://github.com/gopherjs/websocket/issues/18" TITLE : don't import fmt BODY : the only reason to import fmt appears to be because of the following line of code: go return fmt.sprintf closeevent: %s %d %s , cleanstmt, e.code, e.reason this could trivially be replaced by go return closeevent: + cleanstmt + + strconv.itoa e.code + + e.reason this would lead to smaller file sizes for the projects using the websocket bindings.
