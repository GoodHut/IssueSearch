 URL : "https://github.com/Profugo-Barbatus/TiberiumRim/issues/39" TITLE : tiberium item radiation BODY : so i thought that we should make the raw tiberium items deteriorate nearby items that are not tiberium related, so that the harvested tiberium still has some sort of danger to it instead of being as harmless as wood.
