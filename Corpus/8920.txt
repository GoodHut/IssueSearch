 URL : "https://github.com/klukule/merlin/issues/20" TITLE : skip keeper bug BODY : bot does ignore to skip keeper mobs . nothing printed in console, char does simply unmount and start to attack mobs 'round chest spawn spot. obviously, dies -_- i think problem is somwhere in pathing logic, cause char behavior is similar to loot-mobs: detects aggro, unmounts, attacks. before bug appeared char tried to avoid and changed it's way. sometimes it got stucked, but now it totally forgot how to avoid.
