 URL : "https://github.com/karlredman/dirp/issues/1" TITLE : add help system BODY : the dirp command/alias needs a help printout. the problem this presents is that commands and aliases might be overridden by the user. possible resolutions register all commands in an array with the respective help. probably kills the ability to use aliases. add a generic help printout at user's own peril if they change stuffs each function has it's own help option
