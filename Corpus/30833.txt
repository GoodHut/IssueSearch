 URL : "https://github.com/digitalbazaar/bedrock-angular-searchbox/issues/5" TITLE : redesign search box BODY : this search box is way too complex. we should strive for a google landing-page like search experience since that's what folks are used to. we should eliminate: the search button. the clear button. the help button. we should move: the search icon to the right and put it inside the box, if possible ultimately, the search box should just be a text input box. /cc @dlongley @mattcollier
