 URL : "https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula/issues/743" TITLE : open collective is a pain BODY : i tried to make a donation to tabula awhile back, and wound up getting subscribed by open collective to monthly donations. i complained about it and fixed it, but they continued to send me marketing emails. this is totally inappropriate . i don't care about open collective. i was trying to make a one-time donation to a totally different project. i've had more problems with open collective than i have with tabula. their latest email update brags about open collective v2 , which features like: - custom tiers: set up all kinds of sponsorship levels, backer rewards, special campaigns, or other creative ideas. - improved donation interface: see contribution amounts and frequency more clearly. etc. i'm not even subscribed to updates about tabula itself. i've unsubscribed now, again, which hopefully will work, but i shouldn't have had to unsubscribe to open collective twice -- once from monthly donations billed automatically, and once from email marketing about a product that i never expressed any interest in. dan
