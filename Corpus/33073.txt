 URL : "https://github.com/QijingZheng/pyband/issues/1" TITLE : a problem in 'pydos' BODY : dear qijing, an error occurred to me while executing 'pydos', and i found it's because there were too many bands 2800 , then no blank space left between : and 2800 , as shown below of k-points: 1 of bands:2800 of ions: 576 and using large number of k-points and ions will cause this failure as well, do you have any improvement to avoid modifying 'procar' manually? thanks a lot. best wishes, homleeguo
