 URL : "https://github.com/Docapost-Agility/mka/issues/33" TITLE : right click position BODY : i've got an issue with the rightclick function which seems to fix the position of the div i'm giving to. the issue is that it's an absolute position that doesn't take care of its wrapper-div parent width & height, so it's creating a scrollbar that only scroll up or down, right or left this div. here is a quick demonstration of this issue. ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17875419/32109389-e30e20ba-bb34-11e7-864b-52bac4ec26cd.png ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17875419/32109430-fdcc5e76-bb34-11e7-9f61-d897df2a4b09.png
