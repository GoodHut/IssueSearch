 URL : "https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/25013" TITLE : tooltips not centered BODY : i am getting bizarre results with my tooltips. they are not centered properly. please see this fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/uf0epmxm/6/ i have absolutely no idea why this is happening. i reproduced it in the fiddle. you can see that it is not centered when you hover over the add role button: <button type= button class= btn btn-primary data-modal= http://laraback.dev/roles/add data-toggle= tooltip title= add >add role</button> one thing i noticed is if i remove the top blue navbar entirely it centers correctly. thanks for the help.
