 URL : "https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/issues/2046" TITLE : retain page for treetable BODY : reported by pro user; > we are using <p:treetable paginator= true ../> with paginator. we noticed that after page navigation if the table is updated on any operation within the same view the current page of the tree table is reset back to 1. expected behavior: on update of treetable the current page should remain the same. noticed that this behavior works fine with <p:datatable/>. the current page is maintained.
