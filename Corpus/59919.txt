 URL : "https://github.com/cssinjs/react-jss/issues/109" TITLE : variables in js styles BODY : i've noticed that some frameworks like emotion https://medium.com/@tkh44/emotion-ad1c45c6d28b support dynamic css styles controlled by props. i'm not 100% sure if i think it's a good idea though i tend to use inline styles for anything dynamic . out of curiosity though, do you have any plans to support dynamic styles in react-jss ?
