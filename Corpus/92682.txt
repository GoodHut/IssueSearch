 URL : "https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/issues/528" TITLE : 0.11 empty graphiql.min.js BODY : hi, looks like the most recent build is missing graphiql.min.js file in the distribution. that is https://unpkg.com/graphiql@0.11.0/graphiql.min.js is empty but https://unpkg.com/graphiql@0.10.2/graphiql.min.js is fine. we reference it from the cdn as <script src= //unpkg.com/graphiql/graphiql.min.js ></script> which now redirect to 0.11, and thus breaks some of the pages. is it possible to still ship the .min file?
