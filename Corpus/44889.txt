 URL : "https://github.com/RedHatGov/ssg-el7-kickstart/issues/48" TITLE : fw additional entries BODY : hello, i am trying to add new firewall rules into the final iso image, but seems they are not taking into consideration. even the ssh port is not opened and needs to be readeed, once the new server is deployed. so far i have tried to add the firewall-cmd rules to the following files: ssg-rhel.cfg ssg-supplemental.sh menu.py none is taking into consideration the new fw entries. any suggestion on this one? thank you.
