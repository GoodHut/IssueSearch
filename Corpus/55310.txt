 URL : "https://github.com/mar10/fancytree/issues/761" TITLE : init error if no nodes BODY : $ ' div' .fancytree {source: } throws an error on init. your code expects the parent ul to have children, which it doesn't if there are no nodes. is this by design? what's the recommended approach for handling this? i don't want to display any placeholder, and it also seems you have to init/destroy fancytree each time it flipped between empty and non-empty if this is a design choice.
