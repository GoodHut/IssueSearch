 URL : "https://github.com/vercellone/vsts-f5-tasks/issues/4" TITLE : blue-green swap storage BODY : blue-green deployment - select task writes a clixml file to the $env:system_workfolder. if blue-green deployment - swap runs on a different agent with a different $env:system_workfolder, an error will be thrown and the swap will fail. i currently mitigate this by adding a demand and agent capability which forces both tasks to execute using the same agent.
