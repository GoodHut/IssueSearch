 URL : "https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg-examples/issues/7" TITLE : post data example BODY : hi andrew thanks for this examples but i wonder if you consider adding more examples in the future like posts block. there's latest post block in gutenberg and i try to do a similar block but i can't find a way to import a function from another files like it's done in latest post block var el = wp.element.createelement, registerblocktype = wp.blocks.registerblocktype, import { getdata } from './data.js'; when i add import getdata my block disappear in the editor and i can't understand why.
