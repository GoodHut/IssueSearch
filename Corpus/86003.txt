 URL : "https://github.com/flammy/fsapi/issues/11" TITLE : get currently playing uri BODY : not really an issue but a question: i studied the docs but found nothing about it. is there a way to determine the currently playing uri for mode 0 webradio ? either by querying the uri directly or getting it from the preset list? i didn't find a get-url query for this task. from where do you know all the possible get/set-urls? as far as i know there's no full documentation. thanks!
