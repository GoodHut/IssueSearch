 URL : "https://github.com/hkbakke/bash-insulter/issues/10" TITLE : mac os x workarounds BODY : maybe it will be helpful to others, making it work on mac os needs a couple of tweaks! the issues: - date line 69 doesn't format nano seconds properly %n is not available under macos - shuf line 74 doesn't exists either - for some odd reason the variable random gives unexpected results maybe it's a oh-my-zsh issue - error is printed twice again, could be a oh-my-zsh issue the solution: - i used brew, so let's first install coreutils brew install coreutils , that will make gdate and gshuf available - replace date with gdate line 69 and shuf with gshuf line 74 - rename random into rando or whatever - comment the echo on line 105 to avoid double error printing under zsh attached the file with my modification, hope it helps! : bash.command-not-found.txt https://github.com/hkbakke/bash-insulter/files/1491204/bash.command-not-found.txt
