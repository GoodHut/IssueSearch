 URL : "https://github.com/1up-lab/contao-mailchimp/issues/6" TITLE : enhancement: field sorting BODY : cheers, really enjoy your extension, thanks! i'm using it in a contao 3.5 and it works good. but there is one small thing i would like to see: if i add a field in mailchimp before the email field it doesn't show up in front of the email field in my website. mailchimp: ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6306291/29715141-60000ff4-89a6-11e7-862f-fed4924ecba0.png website: ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6306291/29715188-7dff1612-89a6-11e7-9754-ab58ba1718a3.png this is due to the code in modulesucscribe.php where you add the email field line 59 before you go over each field line 70 that is additionally added in mailchimp. would be awesome if you could change the code so that it looks for the order in mailchimp and outputs it to the website as well. if you need more info let me know. thanks, bastibuck
