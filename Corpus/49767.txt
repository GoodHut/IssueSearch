 URL : "https://github.com/felipeochoa/rjsx-mode/issues/47" TITLE : update license to gpl BODY : this project uses significant parts of the js2-mode https://github.com/mooz/js2-mode package. the js2-mode package is licensed under the gplv3 https://github.com/mooz/js2-mode/blob/master/license by the free software foundation. according to the license terms, this project is _de jure_ subject to the gplv3 license. saying otherwise would be misleading. see: if a library is released under the gpl not the lgpl , does that mean that any software which uses it has to be under the gpl or a gpl-compatible license? https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html iflibraryisgpl please update the license to clear confusion that may arise.
