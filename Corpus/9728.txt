 URL : "https://github.com/danpaulson/swgoh.gg.public/issues/16" TITLE : add chars to coi BODY : this would be very simple to do programmatically: add all the ls characters to the coi page such as here: https://swgoh.gg/g/15449/team-lnstinct/?stats=coi which will allow guilds to see who is where star/gear wise, and not just cls and hrs x2. later when ships get implemented, you can add those too! this is an extremely small fix to something that the swgoh community will find extremely useful once tb hits.
