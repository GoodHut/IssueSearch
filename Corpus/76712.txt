 URL : "https://github.com/explosion/lightnet/issues/1" TITLE : lots to do! help wanted. BODY : i'll make threads for the more specific issues, but in general: our use-case for this library is pretty limited --- we just want to get a good object detection system running for prodigy. there's a lot more that could be added that we won't get to for some time. if you're interested in darknet, i hope you'll consider contributing. in particular there are lots of open pull requests on https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/pulls that might be integrated here. some of them seem like very relevant bugs, including memory leaks etc. some of these things might be good tasks for someone learning ai, depending on your background. personally, i found the darknet codebase very helpful when i was learning neural networks. i'm not saying it's some sort of polished jewel --- there's plenty of inconsistencies, and some questionable decisions --- but it's not abstract. it's pretty simple and direct code. you can't get that from tensorflow or pytorch, which really hide the computation under many layers of abstraction.
