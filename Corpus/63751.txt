BODY : the script completes when running agaisnt nxos devices but i get the following error when the device is ios. i thought it was due to the output of show ip int brief in ios has interfaces with no ip addresses so i edited the command being sent from show ip int brief to sh ip int brief | i 1-9 \. this didn't work either. traceback most recent call last : file dns-crawl.py , line 440, in <module> main file dns-crawl.py , line 427, in main dnsdict = create_dns_dict interfacesdict file dns-crawl.py , line 387, in create_dns_dict interface_name = interface_identifier interface_string file dns-crawl.py , line 143, in interface_identifier if global_verbose: print unknown int type == + inttype nameerror: global name 'global_verbose' is not defined
