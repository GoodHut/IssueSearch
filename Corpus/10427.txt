 URL : "https://github.com/osmdroid/osmdroid/issues/548" TITLE : change cache dir BODY : since i moved to 5.6, with sqlite + partitions scanning, this moved my osmdroid path on the large external sd card. as expected. but i also observed a constant behaviour: as soon as the tiles/cache.db file reaches 7 mo, tiles display slows down incredibly. in fact, it's usually much more efficient to destroy this file completely and start again getting tiles from 3g network . i suspect my external sd card to be much much slower than the built-in sd card, but i've no evidence of that. or a perf issue on osmdroid sqlite cache system? but this should be well known now. i'm now trying to benchmark the internal/external perf aspect. i tried this: configuration.getinstance .setosmdroidbasepath new file environment.getexternalstoragedirectory .getabsolutepath + /osmdroid ; configuration.getinstance .setosmdroidtilecache new file environment.getexternalstoragedirectory .getabsolutepath + /osmdroid/tiles ; map = mapview findviewbyid r.id.map ; but it has no effect on the cache file location. the samplealternatecachedir is not really clear on what should be done. what i'm supposed to do?
