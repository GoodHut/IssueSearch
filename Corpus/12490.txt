 URL : "https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env/issues/455" TITLE : polyfill - usage BODY : i am trying to include polyfill based on my usage in the source code. ex: string.includes in file a.js my front end build: webpack: 3.8.1 babel-loader: 7.1.2 my .babelrc { presets : env , { modules : false, targets : { browsers : last 2 versions , ie >= 10 }, usebuiltins : usage , debug : true } } my package.json contains babel-polyfill : ^6.26.0 in the dependencies section. and finally my webpack config part of it is entry: {'app': './a.js' } expected behaviour: include the polyfill only for string.prototype.includes in the output bundle. actual behaviour: webpack build failure with error message can't resolve 'regenerator-runtime/runtime' . can you please let me know what i am missing in this setup or is my expectation not correct?
