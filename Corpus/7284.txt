 URL : "https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/issues/885" TITLE : fake takelatest BODY : what problem does this feature solve? all takelatest -like situations. a good example would be having an action that get a list from a server by sending a bunch of filters. if we debounce it by 500ms there still is a potential scenario when you change filters while request is in progress and there is a tiny chance that second action's request will come before first one so mutation with the second list that we want will happen before the first list that we don't want anymore . a fake takelatest would be an ability to mark an action as cancelled so that it can not call mutations calls no-op instead . it's not perfect but it would cover a lot of possible scenarios. what does the proposed api look like? i have no idea <!-- generated by vue-issues. do not remove -->
