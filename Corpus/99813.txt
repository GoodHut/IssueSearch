 URL : "https://github.com/coreos/kube-aws/issues/377" TITLE : no 'global' customsettings BODY : if a cluster configuration contains customsettings variables required by both controllers and workers alike, there is no way to reference the variables via {{ .customsettings.xxxx }} in both controllers and workers without duplicating the customsettings variables in cluster.yaml. related to: https://github.com/coreos/kube-aws/issues/346 i propose a 'global' customsettings to be defined in cluster.yaml which can be used in both controllers and workers in addition to nodepool/controller specific customsettings that would override and existing global values.
