 URL : "https://github.com/squidmedia/gf-entries-in-excel/issues/2" TITLE : regenerate download slug BODY : for security reasons we need to be able to change the download slug / hash for a form. although the hash is generated via the nonce_salt in the wp-config.php , this means that to invalidate the url, we'd be invalidating every url; which isn't ideal. a better solution would be to add a form specific salt, which can be updated / regenerated.
