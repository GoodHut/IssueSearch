 URL : "https://github.com/wesbos/keycodes/issues/217" TITLE : missing keycode 0 BODY : tell me what key it was or even better, submit a pull request! actually, this number seems to be associated with the play/pause button, the stop button, the rewind button, and the fast forward button on the logitech g19 keyboard. it's supposed to work with video players, but if it's assigned the same code to all four buttons, i couldn't tell you how it works.
