 URL : "https://github.com/espruino/Espruino/issues/1212" TITLE : stm32 neopixel output BODY : previously this disabled irqs during the send, but that could cause lost serial data. now, re-enabling them might cause glitches - although less likely now that all data to be sent is in one big, flat buffer. need to check this for 1v94 and potentially move to a dma-based spi send if needed.
