 URL : "https://github.com/phpmentors-jp/workflower/issues/29" TITLE : bpmn diagram editor BODY : can you recommend a bpmn editor for use with workflower? i tried to use the eclipse bpmn modeller as mentioned in the docs, but it doesn't seem to allow setting the id of components via the ui. i also tried using camunda but it doesn't seem to be able to set operations on send/service tasks only via it's custom extensions . i know i can edit the xml directly, but i'd like to find something that clients could use that supports the bpmn features workflower uses, thanks!
