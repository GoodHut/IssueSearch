 URL : "https://github.com/rusenask/keel/issues/100" TITLE : secrets are not found BODY : hi together, i'm currently facing some problem when trying to use keel. i have the following setup. + private repository in quay.io + robot account set up in quay.io + secret.yaml file provided by quay.io deployed to kubernetes cluster then i installed an own package via helm and set the imagepullsecret in the template file of the deployment. when i now push a new image to the quay.io repo keel should pull automatically the new version but currently it fails to authenticate against quay.io with the error message level=info msg= secrets.defaultgetter.lookupsecrets: no secrets for image found image=quay.io/group/myimage namespace=default pod_selector= app=myimageapp,release=dangling-aardvark pods_checked=0 provider=helm registry=quay.io is there another place where i should reference the secret or am i using it completely wrong? thank you in advance.
