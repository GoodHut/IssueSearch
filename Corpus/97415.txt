 URL : "https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/issues/584" TITLE : golang semicolon insertion BODY : currently golang.g4 grammar treats semicolons as optional in most cases, for example: //sourcefile = packageclause ; { importdecl ; } { topleveldecl ; } . sourcefile : packageclause ';'? importdecl ';'? topleveldecl ';'? ; which accepts code like this: package main func main { i := 1 i += 1} according to spec https://golang.org/ref/spec semicolons golang allows omitting semicolons using following rules: > 1.when the input is broken into tokens, a semicolon is automatically inserted into the token stream immediately after a line's final token if that token is an identifier an integer, floating-point, imaginary, rune, or string literal one of the keywords break, continue, fallthrough, or return one of the operators and delimiters ++, --, , , or } >2. to allow complex statements to occupy a single line, a semicolon may be omitted before a closing or } . i think i can fix this in a similar way as it was done ecmascript.g4 pr is on the way
