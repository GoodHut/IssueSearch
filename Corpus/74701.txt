 URL : "https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/858" TITLE : feature request: pg_trgm BODY : what do you want to do and how do you expect diesel to support you with that? i want to use the pg_trgm module, in particular the similarity , % and <-> functions/operators. diesel should allow the safe construction of queries involving these. how do you think this can be added to diesel? this'd hopefully be added with a similarity text, text function, and two text expression methods text <-> text distance and text % text is similar to , and maybe the other functions described on https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/pgtrgm.html to be comprehensive. it might also be a good idea to introduce another feature gate. what are possible alternatives? dealing with raw queries, but nobody wants that. :p are there any disadvantages? none that i can think of.
