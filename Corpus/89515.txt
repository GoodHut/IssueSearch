 URL : "https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-table/issues/152" TITLE : question expand row by id BODY : hello, is there a simple way to expand a row subcomponent by specific data id id from the database ? my theoretical but complex solution now is to calculate the page number first, where the item should be and set the page number manually and then set expandedrows property with the item index. a better way would be to check dataitem.id == row.data.id and pass a property expanded = true thanks for any help on this
