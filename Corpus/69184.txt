 URL : "https://github.com/thezbyg/gpick/issues/142" TITLE : suggestion about layout BODY : currently in version 0.2.5 there are only four layouts samples. i suggestion to add more samples to cover more design requirements and wider scope of demonstration such as blog layout, gallery layout, cart layout, etc. also, if is it possible, to allow user adding his/her own layout it will be so handy idea.
