 URL : "https://github.com/spadarian/docblock-python/issues/1" TITLE : tab through arguments BODY : hey jose, first of all, thank you so much for doing this. that's the one thing i've been missing after moving from vim to atom. it would be great if one can tab through the arguments like you can do in https://atom.io/packages/docblockr or ultisnips, but i have no idea how hard it would be to implement this.
