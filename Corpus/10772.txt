 URL : "https://github.com/golang/dep/issues/1446" TITLE : dep source usage BODY : what version of dep are you using dep version ? dep: version : v0.3.2 build date : 2017-10-19 git hash : 8ddfc8a go version : go1.9 go compiler : gc platform : darwin/amd64 what dep command did you run? i am running dep ensure . we have our code basically the same code with slight differences hosted on two different servers - a our code is on the public github.com b a second version of our code is in a privately hosted bitbucket not visible to the external world our go source files have statements like - import github.com/foouser/bar using gopkg.toml , i am trying to see if we can make our bitbucket version of the code hit our bitbucket version of some libraries, and not the github.com versions though the import statements in go files say github.com . i am trying - in gopkg.toml constraint name = github.com/foo/bar source = bitbucket.baz.qux.us:7999/foo/bar i also tried override what did you expect to see? i expect that, even though the go source files say import github.com/foouser/bar , the bitbucket version of the package github.com/foo/bar should be used what did you see instead? ensure solve : bitbucket.baz.qux.us:7999/foo/bar is not a valid import path
