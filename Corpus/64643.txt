 URL : "https://github.com/rippex/ripple-client-desktop/issues/52" TITLE : hanging, payment failed BODY : i'm using 1.4.1 of the client for mac, and i've been using it for months now without any issues, it's quite well designed in general. now every time i send a payment it hangs for up to multiple minutes between filling in each field, the recipient field, the destination tag and the amount, it just hangs and says checking . ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4825055/33912929-97c08814-df4c-11e7-890f-3cc14e21762b.png after wading through that for a few minutes, i finally press send when sending the payment, it hangs for another minute then says: payment failed ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4825055/33913050-12934bb2-df4d-11e7-909f-0a94405c5b5e.png i'm guessing this has to do with your servers, because i was able to send ripple quickly over the network otherwise, it's just this wallet which is very slow right now.
