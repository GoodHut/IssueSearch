 URL : "https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/884" TITLE : allow sorting by latest BODY : some of us replaced yt with newpipe entirely. in this case what i'm particularly missing is sorting feature that would allow me finding newly published videos. it's pretty handy while looking for latest news about some topic. normally it shows most viewed or trended.
