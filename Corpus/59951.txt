 URL : "https://github.com/epn-vespa/DaCHS-for-VESPA/issues/7" TITLE : versioning and updates BODY : hi, we just received a comment from the grenoble team. they tried to use the epntap2-2 mixin from this repository. the result of the discussion is: - the version of the epntap2 mixin of this repository must be clearly specified: this includes which version of dachs it has been tested on. - specifiy which features this mixin adds compared to the official mixin. we may consider change the name of the epntap2 mixin of this repository, in order to reduce the risk of errors and confusion. cheers baptiste
