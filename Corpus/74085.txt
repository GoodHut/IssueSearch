 URL : "https://github.com/EtonDigital/EDBlogBundle/issues/35" TITLE : doesn't work with sylius BODY : hello, we are currently using sylius http://sylius.org 1.0.4 with your bundle for our project, but are having a few problems. these are not problems directly linked to your bundle, but after implementation into our solution. we tried using the dev-symfony3 branch which fixes problems related to the composer.json, but are left with these : - annotations: @paramconverter article , class= ed\blogbundle\interfaces\model\articleinterface , converter= abstract_converter this is an exampltthis is an example, but every paramconverter crashes the application. - user bloguserinterface : we are using the sylius user class and are having a problem with the parameter’s type. if we remove the consraint in your bundle it works fine. the only solution i have found at the moment is to modify your bundle directly, but i’m not satisfied with that solution for many reasons... do you have a better solution ? i didn't know where to post this, but if you could help me i would be very grateful have a good day.
