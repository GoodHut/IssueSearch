 URL : "https://github.com/xoanmi/ansible-module-infoblox/issues/39" TITLE : add_host record issue BODY : hi there, after the update to 2.5, the example you give in the readme fails to create a host record, it now throws the following message: > exception: ip address for the host record is missing works fine with 2.4. i haven't checked all the other functions yet, but will start to write a set of test plays to try to catch this sort of thing. thanks, /andy
