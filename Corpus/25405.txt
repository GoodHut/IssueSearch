 URL : "https://github.com/childline-yoti/online-content-reporter/issues/53" TITLE : yoti app redirects BODY : the current system is working _fine_ on desktop. on mobile we have the following issue: 1 when using, the url which is built in 'mobile' for the href of a tag: const href = ${responseobj.qrcodeurl}?callback=${callbackurl}&id=${responseobj.application.id}&mobile=true https://code.yoti.com/caeajdmzywezyjmxlwrkogytnda0ys05zmi3ltm0mwy0mjrhzddjyjac... yoti redirects directly to the app and asks for pin: ! img_2632 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15717822/23645743/4769390a-0316-11e7-9934-4b64ed487332.png then a screen with button to 'allow': ! img_2633 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15717822/23645757/52d86cc0-0316-11e7-8e79-be72624a98ff.png and then an additional confirmation page ! img_2634 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15717822/23645771/62e96ee8-0316-11e7-8813-40e64db0f072.png this page now hangs and no redirect to the browser occurs... 2 however... when the href tag is: t.config.service + t.appid https://www.yoti.com/connect/appid the app redirects in the browser to the url first. this is a connect endpoint has a connect button. ! img_2635 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15717822/23645841/dc24d48c-0316-11e7-866e-60b294835ce7.png clicking connect then launches the app! the 'allow' page as seen above is presented. key difference: on allow, yoti now redirects successfully back to the browser to the callback url '/thankyou'... suggested issue: the url constructor provided by yoti: e.href = t.qrcodeurl + ?callback= + t.callbackurl + &id= + t.application.id + &mobile= + json.stringify !!n does'nt function as it should.. possibly an issue with the callbackurl? as no redirect occurs on sharing data with app.
