 URL : "https://github.com/codaco/feedback-site/issues/12" TITLE : new issue flow BODY : the initial idea for the new issue flow called for a wizard. - step 1 - log in or continue as guest allows the user to choose between two authentication options. emphasizes the trade offs associated with posting as a guest no email notifications, mostly . - step 2 - title your feedback during this step, the user titled their feedback. here, there is a realtime search happening of existing feedback titles, with fuzzy matching see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask for an example . if matches are returned above a given threshold, they should be shown and suggested to the user as alternative venues for their feedback. clicking on these titles should open that feedback thread in a new tab. - step 3 - feedback content and tagging i would still like to see this flow implemented, as i think it has quite a few advantages over what we currently have. at the very least, i think we need to have the fuzzy matching of new titles to existing issues to cut down on potential duplicates and try to streamline discussions.
