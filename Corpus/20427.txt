 URL : "https://github.com/kaj/rsass/issues/11" TITLE : changes in rustfmt BODY : the latest version of rustfmt changes the default formatting of rust code quite dramatically, personally i like the new defaults, but i guess it is a matter of taste. the pr i just submitted fails on travis due to these changes. this leaves us with a few options: 1. reformat everything to the new style 2. keep the existing formatting and apply legacy config so we can use the new version of rustfmt but keep the old style 3. keep the existing formatting and pin to an old version of rustfmt @kaj which do you think is the best option?
