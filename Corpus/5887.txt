 URL : "https://github.com/vkarpov15/archetype-js/issues/6" TITLE : throw on extra BODY : hi. currently, after defining a schema, if a user enters more fields than what is defined in the schema, the extra fields are dropped silently. ex: const person = new archetype { name: 'string', bandid: { $type: objectid, $required: true }, createdat: { $type: moment, $default: => moment } } .compile 'person' ; // first client on the website sends this let userobject = { name: 'wagner', bandid: '000000000000000000000001', ishacker: true } let user = new person userobject ; // user.ishacker === undefined i wonder if there are any plans to adding the feature of throwing on extra fields like what we currently have with mongoose strict mode http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html strict . thanks.
