 URL : "https://github.com/atom/github/issues/949" TITLE : standalone version ? BODY : hi everybody, thanks to the atom team and contributors for bringing git and github integration in atom, it's very simple and well made 👍 this package is so good that i'm very interested to see it also released as a standalone version as an electron app, for example . this would be an excellent alternative to existing heavy git clients sourcetree, gitkraken, etc. . what do you think ? any chance to see that happening ? keep up the good work ! 😉
