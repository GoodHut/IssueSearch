 URL : "https://github.com/clawpack/geoclaw/issues/264" TITLE : rework storm modules BODY : reorganize the storm modules so that there are now two types: - model-driven storms: a model for the wind and pressure is used to fill in the wind and pressure fields e.g. holland model - data-driven storms: a field of data from either observed winds or output from an atmospheric model is used and interpolated.
