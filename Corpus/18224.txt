 URL : "https://github.com/glacasa/Mastonet/issues/21" TITLE : status id too big BODY : on some of the bigger mastodon instances, the status ids currently being assigned have exceeded int.maxvalue . it looks like mastodon.social just crossed that threshold in the past few days. because mastonet declared status id to be an int, it causies an exception in the json parser when reading the values: ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3808901/31546140-1b295a50-aff0-11e7-9d50-95089ca0c7be.png it looks like _all_ mastodon keys are now 64-bit integers https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/pull/5088 , so really every id in the mastonet models should probably be converted to long s. however, _my_ project is currently only breaking on status id, so i would like to see _that_ fixed asap :
