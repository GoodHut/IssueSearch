 URL : "https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glslang/issues/731" TITLE : better cmake support BODY : i don't want to be harsh, but either the cmake scripts are not really good, or i did not understand the build at all. we should have: - correct dependencies glslang depends on osdependent iirc, it should be reflected in the cmake - correct includes using target_include_directories so that it is automatically set when using in another project - consistent target names why glslang then hlsl , spirv and finally spvremapper ? i can do all the changes listed above and create a pull request if needed.
