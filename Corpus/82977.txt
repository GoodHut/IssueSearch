 URL : "https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/dbhub.io/issues/74" TITLE : better markdown processor BODY : at present we're rendering markdown content using go-commonmark https://github.com/rhinoman/go-commonmark which doesn't seem actively developed any more. we should probably investigate using blackfriday https://github.com/russross/blackfriday instead, which looks simple to implement too and also supports more useful markdown extensions eg tables! .
