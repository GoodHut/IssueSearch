 URL : "https://github.com/anantmittal/kernel-jupyter/issues/3" TITLE : return new data BODY : update the kernel to return new data to the ipython front end. first, describe in this ticket what the datastructure is which is returned to ipython. then extend this to return on success or failure the number of characters in the code which was sent with do_execute . note: make use of inheritance wherever possible, e.g. chaining, where you are ideally just modifying the results of the ipythonkernel instead of redoing all of that code.
