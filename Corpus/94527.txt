 URL : "https://github.com/Newcomer1989/TSN-Ranksystem/issues/332" TITLE : cant send private messages BODY : i just installed the bot and set it up. but when trying to send a private message to it, i just get an error: insufficient client permissions gescheitert an i_client_needed_private_textmessage_power . but i have the permissions high enough. but when sending one via yatqa i get following error: invalid clientid. the bot uses the initial serveradmin password because i already have a bot which uses the normal server query login. so is there a way for me to get around this issue?
