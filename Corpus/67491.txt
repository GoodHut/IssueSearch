 URL : "https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3/issues/2190" TITLE : ppc with minibatch advi BODY : i have a question about doing the ppc with minibatch advi. the example here https://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc3/notebooks/bayesian_neural_network_opvi-advi.html sets up a shared theano variable ann_input , compiles and fits the model and then does the sampling on some new input by using the set_value method on ann_input . using minibatch, you pass the model a pm.generator . . how do i set the value on this object so i can do the ppc?
