 URL : "https://github.com/speckandtech/speckandtech.github.io/issues/21" TITLE : broken slackin script BODY : the slackin script http://slackin-speckandtech.rhcloud.com/slackin.js does not load, remains in a _pending_ state until it eventually times out after almost 2 minutes. as a result, we don't have our join slack badge anymore. moreover, on some browsers chrome on windows this is shown as an endless loading in the tab section. who created the slackin application and could verify this?
