 URL : "https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/42378" TITLE : debian 7 package support BODY : this is a followup to 34115 and 31764 sorry for stressing this, but as debian 7 is still lts i have to ask again. why is the support of salt canceled? i know, it's not oldstable anymore but i would guess there are still thousands of installations out there and not all of them are upgradable to debian 8 or 9 in the next weeks.
