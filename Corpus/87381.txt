 URL : "https://github.com/recalapp/recal/issues/328" TITLE : lazily load semester data BODY : currently, all semesters displayed have their data loaded on page load. this means that switching later on is fast, but the initial load is terribly slow. instead, only the latest semester's data should be loaded initially, and the rest of the data is loaded lazily. by lazily , i mean that the data for a given semester should be loaded once that tab is clicked.
