 URL : "https://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot/issues/651" TITLE : bug in datetime parsing BODY : hello, as i use the parsing module for datetime conversion, in the function ' date_from_relative_week_year ' the ordinal value that is being passed into the function is not being used. for example if the text input was next 3 weeks... the output is being of only one week. i believe this is because ordinal is not being used here. i tried to fix it my myself i adding the ordinal value to the relative date, but i am unsuccessful in doing so. any help on this issue is appreciated.
