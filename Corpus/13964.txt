 URL : "https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/issues/5351" TITLE : access true label BODY : i am a beginner and try to use a pre-trained resnet. i have a problem of accessing the ground truth label. i looked at some tutorial and still got quite confused: sym, arg_params, aux_params = mx.model.load_checkpoint 'resnet-152', 0 all_layers = sym.get_internals net = all_layers 'flatten0'+'_output' net = mx.symbol.fullyconnected data=net, num_hidden=num_classes, name='fc1' net = mx.symbol.softmaxoutput data=net, name='softmax' this softmaxoutput layer doesn't seem to take the true label as a argument which is described as a non-optional parameter on the website . how the loss is calculated when label is not passed to the softmax output layer? i looked at the input list of symbol sym the pretrained resnet model and found softmax_label is in there. i want to scale the loss contribution of each sample based on their true labels. how can i access the labels under this circumstances ? and how can i access the loss it seems the loss is computed in the softmaxoutput layer but not outputted.? for bugs or installation issues, please provide the following information. the more information you provide, the more likely people will be able to help you. environment info operating system: compiler: package used python/r/scala/julia : mxnet version: or if installed from source: mxnet commit hash git rev-parse head : if you are using python package, please provide python version and distribution: if you are using r package, please provide r sessioninfo : error message: please paste the full error message, including stack trace. minimum reproducible example if you are using your own code, please provide a short script that reproduces the error. steps to reproduce or if you are running standard examples, please provide the commands you have run that lead to the error. 1. 2. 3. what have you tried to solve it? 1. 2. 3.
