 URL : "https://github.com/mkdo/kapow-sass/issues/11" TITLE : globbing for sass partials BODY : to shave off a few more seconds during development, it would be useful if globbing could be introduced to reduce the need for adding new partials to the main site.scss file. this would need to exclude settings/plumbing/config folders which need to be particular when it comes to loading order. recommend keeping this to component, module and page folders etc.
