 URL : "https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/issues/2325" TITLE : for -each loop BODY : summary: stan should support a foreach loop syntax: for x in xs { ... } for example, for x in { 1, 2, 3 } print foo , x, = , foo x ; matrix y; ... for y_i in y target += bar_lpdf y_i | theta ; description: as with for loops, the loop declares a local variable x , whose type is given by if xs is a vector or row_vector or matrix , then x is real , and if xs is an array of type t , then x is of type t the variable x here can be any identifier, but it must not be a reserved word or defined in the containing scope i.e., no masking . the underlying implementation should just rely on the c++11 foreach, with foreach x in xs body x translating to for const auto&& x : xs body where xs and body are the translations of xs and body . the body should not allow assignment to x . i haven't tried it, but the translation is intended to pass x by constant reference. reproducible steps: please report steps to reproduce the issue. if it's not possible to reproduce, please include a description of how you discovered the issue. if you have a reproducible example, please include it. current output: the current output. knowing what is the current behavior is useful. expected output: describe what you expect the output to be. knowing the correct behavior is also very useful. additional information: provide any additional information here. current version: v2.15.0
