 URL : "https://github.com/mefellows/muxy/issues/6" TITLE : add support for dns chaos BODY : dns issues are are not so common but the severity can be extremely high https://www.itnews.com.au/news/revealed-ibm-error-caused-nab-outage-438970 . add support for hosting a primary zone with the following hl requirements: ability to proxy another zone ability to miss records at a given rate e.g. simulate rr dns failure ability to delay or add latency a lookup at random or fixed rates test local dns caching ability to blacklist certain records, by not returning a dns entry ability to corrupt certain records, by returning an invalid response _note_: some of the features could be implemented using the tcp network symptom, however a dedicated dns component that can target specific records and types of failures is preferred. see the following for inspiration: https://github.com/miekg/dns https://github.com/looterz/grimd https://github.com/slene/dnsproxy/blob/master/dnsproxy.go
