 URL : "https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-skipper/issues/304" TITLE : add oauth support BODY : as a user, i'd like to secure skipper's rest endpoints backed by a oauth provider. goals: - reuse the generalized security library https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-common-security-config - port just the oauth support no need to include ldap/file - no role definitions are necessary for the first release. if the oauth token is valid and it is authorized, we will allow access to all the endpoints - verify to make sure skipper shell behavior is consistent with the rest endpoints
