 URL : "https://github.com/mage-mzax/emarketing/issues/20" TITLE : not sending emails BODY : i thought it was working because i seen that two test emails were sent. everything seems to be working, test mails send out, cron is running fine, i noticed domain_throttle.data and geoip.sess is being updated, no errors or javascript errors. i installed it on a fresh magento 1.9.2.2 and still the same thing. everything seems to be in order but it just doesn't seem to send out emails. i've tried running all kinds of different campaigns. i just can't get it to work. any ideas? thanks
