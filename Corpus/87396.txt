BODY : the red led inside ws2812 leds is typically not as bright as the blue and green. i've noticed that it takes very little green to make the color orange. instead of hue 30 orange is actually hue 15. and to make yellow the hue is 28 not 60. is this the same with most leds? can we change the values in ledstrip.c hsvcolor_t hsv so that the colors are accurate. or should we change colorconversion.c so the hue values are correct? maybe just decrease the strength of green for case 0? can other people confirm that their leds do not correctly produce the color orange. i would like to make sure this is a common issue and not just my leds before changing it.
