 URL : "https://github.com/sillyfrog/SonOTA/issues/8" TITLE : feature: autojoin networks BODY : i was flashing 15 devices so far and it's annoying to switch wifis. cant we do sudo iwlist eth0 scan | grep itead and if there is some return than we take that one with something like nmcli d connect itead {id} then we disconnect from that or join the original one and then we listen for the finalstage and join and rejoin. just an idea ;
