 URL : "https://github.com/engram-design/FeedMe/issues/198" TITLE : better asset error logging BODY : speaking of logs, with the new hash check, feed me generates errors like: > 2017/04/13 01:41:29 error plugin forced asset error: http://www.domain.com/path/toimages/ - the file “d20a3d5f6eaa679f8e49511edee6db82.jpg” does not appear to be an image. it'd be great if there was some indication of the original url in the log too, so the user can track down the bad source image. ✌️
