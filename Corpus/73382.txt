 URL : "https://github.com/gophercises/urlshort/issues/3" TITLE : create a student example BODY : look over the readme.md https://github.com/gophercises/urlshort/blob/master/readme.md then attempt to complete the exercise and submit your solution as a directory inside of the students directory. eg if you have a github username of joncalhoun then place your code in students/joncalhoun/your_code.go for more info on how these are used see the readme in the students directory. note: i am accepting multiple submissions and recreating the issue for this, as i am looking for multiple student-solutions to use in the casts.
