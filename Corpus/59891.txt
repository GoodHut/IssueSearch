 URL : "https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter/issues/207" TITLE : v1.2 release timeline? BODY : hi, is there a timeline for the release of 1.2? i see there are still a few outstanding commits on the milestone https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter/milestone/2 , but 1.1 https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter/releases/tag/v1.1 points to a commit about two years old. users of dependency managers like glide will likely pin their dependency on httprouter to the latest release 1.1 and get a very old version of httprouter . is it reasonable to either finish the 1.2 blockers soon or push them to a later release?
