 URL : "https://github.com/Factorio-Xander-Mod/Xander-Mod/issues/17" TITLE : stone brick furnace bug BODY : i'm testing/playing from the github master branch repo, and i'm noticing a bug: when pick up a stone brick furnace it becomes a stone furnace vanilla in my inventory and viceversa. i tested in a clean save with xander mod only so its not from others mods, i wonder if could be something related to migration from the last version update...
