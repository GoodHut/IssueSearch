 URL : "https://github.com/PiNet/PiNet/issues/90" TITLE : supporting old pc-s BODY : in the script pinet the word armhf is used 130 times. there are also the variables cpuarch and ltspbase which are never used. if the variables were used instead, it could be easier to adopt this script for other architectures for example i386 . if i replace armhf with i386 everywhere, do you think that these scripts will work for old pcs as well?
