 URL : "https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.cheatsheet/issues/45" TITLE : space after all commas BODY : the python cheatsheet has several places where there aren't spaces after commas i noticed while i was reading some of the notifications this morning : https://github.com/quantecon/quantecon.cheatsheet/blob/master/python-cheatsheet.rst iterating https://github.com/quantecon/quantecon.cheatsheet/blob/master/python-cheatsheet.rst user-defined-functions https://github.com/quantecon/quantecon.cheatsheet/blob/master/python-cheatsheet.rst numpy and others... we should have spaces after all commas in both python and julia i didn't notice any missing spaces in julia but it wouldn't hurt to check . the fact that our team is growing also probably means that we should move the style guide out of our heads and onto paper at some point -- we started a julia version https://github.com/quantecon/quantecon.jl/issues/58 awhile back.
