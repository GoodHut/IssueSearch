 URL : "https://github.com/SPLAT-VO/starjava/issues/32" TITLE : status of this repo BODY : can you please explain why this fork exists of starjava without it being a proper github fork of starjava? i wasn't aware of its existence until it was pointed out by @olebole on the starlink mailing list. it is confusing to have the repos in multiple places when they aren't connected as siblings.
