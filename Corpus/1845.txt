 URL : "https://github.com/gobuffalo/plush/issues/1" TITLE : i18n and i10 BODY : wondering if plush should support some of the localisation features people need ? maybe it should not go into plush, but rather before it at the users golang app level ? example: - language - currency - datatime there are some good golang libs that make a good job of this now. i think this holds the best promise right now: https://github.com/vube/i18n then there is the workflow for managing a project where you need en and then other languages. curious what your think as your closer to this than me.
