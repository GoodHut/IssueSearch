BODY : i could be totally blanking here, but where do you configure the mysql db/user/pass? i see no reference in the config file or docs. and when i looked through the code, i saw both: hardcoded db/user/pass, and reference to some yml keys i havent seen. this seems like an amazingly crucial piece of documentation, as mysql is necessary for cross-server support which is why i liked this one . thanks!
