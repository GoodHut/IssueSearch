 URL : "https://github.com/chriso/lru/issues/31" TITLE : backed by redis BODY : i'm loving this lru cache implementation, but i need use it out of my main node process. i'm playing with the idea of move the cache in a redis service, so i want to ask: do you think that could be more or less easy create a memory laye abtraction, using memory as default, but making possible use specific implementation like redis? ðŸ˜„
