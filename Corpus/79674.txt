 URL : "https://github.com/red6/pdfcompare/issues/12" TITLE : specify a diff threshold BODY : i'm regression testing a lot of pdfs that are rendered to and from many different formats, so there will always be a certain diff. at the moment i have to go through every file manually to ensure that the diff isn't too large, which is quite time consuming. it would be very useful if i could specify that a 2 mm difference would be ok, for example. would this be possible to implement?
