 URL : "https://github.com/nosmokingbandit/Watcher3/issues/124" TITLE : loose title matching BODY : i've recently noticed an issue with parsing movie titles, where a movie may include results from a completely different title. for example, the movie dunkirk and the movie operation dunkirk are both released in 2017 , but operation dunkirk is misinterpreted as dunkirk and included in the results; all the while being a completely different movie.
