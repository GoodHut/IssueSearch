 URL : "https://github.com/sneakypete81/updatescanner/issues/137" TITLE : cookie not used in v4.0.0? BODY : in previous versions of update scanner and ff it was possible to check for updates of pages where user had/is logged in to. probably based on cookies saved by ff i might be wrong . in new version of update scanner this feature doesn't work anymore and update scanner discovers the login page instead of content which is available for logged in users.
