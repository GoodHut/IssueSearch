 URL : "https://github.com/fisharebest/webtrees/issues/1393" TITLE : bootstrap - nuts and bolts BODY : the first thing i will say is that i don’t fully understand how bootstrap works as it dynamically changes screen sizes to match the device. having said that i do have some questions that perhaps you more knowledgeable folks can handle. i have two examples of displays displays seem quite out of line with others. one is my tablet in portrait mode 900 x 1280. the other is my mobile phone in landscape mode 732 x 412. mobile phone: in landscape mode, there is a lot of space waisted on the screen with white space. using the webtrees demo site, webtrees theme, home page as an example, about 25% of the horizontal screen is waisted. this is caused by the bootstrap.mn.css .container @media mix-width: 576px;} with a max-width: 540px; tablet: same thing, again a lot of waisted space due to bootstrap.mn.cs .container @media mix-width: 768px;} with a max-width: 720px; so, my question is, who establishes these parameters for different size screens, us guys or the bootstrap folks? are we as developers expected to fiddle with these things or should be leave it alone. i guess the real reason i ask is that on my page and the home page, there are a lot of optional blocks that have wide data in them. there are different ways to handle these but the variable width’s on different displays makes it a moving target.
