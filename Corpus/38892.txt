 URL : "https://github.com/locationtech-labs/geopyspark/issues/69" TITLE : refactor catalog api BODY : there are currently different catalog classes for each type of backend. we should remove these classes and instead just keep the three functions: read , query , and write . this can be accomplished by using a single uri input format across all backends. an example of this can be seen in 63 . by doing this, we will greatly simplify catalog and make it easier for our users to use.
