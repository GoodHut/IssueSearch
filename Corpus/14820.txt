 URL : "https://github.com/ccd0/4chan-x/issues/1378" TITLE : captcha v2 broken BODY : when all legacy captcha settings are disabled, i am unable to submit any replies. when legacy settings are on, replies work fine. i've tested most possible combinations of captcha settings, and am completely unable to get v2 to work. other sites that use v2 are fine, as is 4chan with the extension disabled.
