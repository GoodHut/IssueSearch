 URL : "https://github.com/Alec-WAM/CrystalMod/issues/1" TITLE : 1.10.2 problems on startup BODY : first of all, it would be better if you make your mod needing tconstruct and enderio on curse. with this option, curse would download automatically both mods. that would help for some people who can't read crash logs. if tconstruct and enderio aren't important for this mod, you should change your code, that your mod doesn't try to load things from both mods as long as they aren't installed. second, i have another unsolved crash on startup: http://pastebin.com/ppuzudtk using forge 12.18.3.2221
