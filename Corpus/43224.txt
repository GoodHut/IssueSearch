 URL : "https://github.com/billstclair/archmage/issues/8" TITLE : complete game history BODY : players will probably eventually request a full game history, replay-able, and restartable at any point. this issue is about how to do that. a move may be encoded as <actor><subject><target><piece> , e.g. a1b2c3h . that's 7 characters. the <actor> will be blank for the initial 14 setup moves. each turn can be stored in a separate key/value pair in the local storage, with keys of archmage-<index> , where <index> is an integer from 1 to the total number of turns. the journal for the current turn is all the undo information that is necessary, and all that needs to be saved on each update. it's a maximum of 14 long, since a move turns that move's actor the other player's color. that's a maximum of 14 7 = 98 characters per turn just append together the fixed-length moves i don't know how many turns it takes to finish a game, but if a piece is captured only once every 10 turns, and i've never seen it take anywhere near that long, then there are a maximum of 13 10 = 130 turns in a game, which is a maximum of 13,000 characters.
