 URL : "https://github.com/drewkeller/pipresents-gapless/issues/2" TITLE : missing more_utils module BODY : installed your version and tried to run the pp_mediashow_lp2.py example of kt's and it throws 4 errors last of which is: file /home/pi/pipresents/pp_medialist.py , line 8, in <module> from more_utils import processfilename there is no more_utils.py in pipresents directory. if i edit the pp_medialist.py file and comment out the import statement containing more_utils .... when i try to run it i get even more errors as it cannot find pexpect which i know is loaded/installed . i'm sure i'm blind to something obvious and simple, but i just don't see it. where is the more_utils located? i don't see it listed as one of the libraries/programs to install. thanks!
