 URL : "https://github.com/nosami/XSVim/issues/11" TITLE : s has no change in xs BODY : pressing s in normal mode in xamarin studio does not delete the current character and move to insert mode. i did a quick check through the source code and saw that it should do this. xamarin studio 6.3 build 863 vim xsvim that is version 0.13 let me know if there is more helpful information i can provide, i'm just glad were getting a well-functioning vim on xamarin studio/vs4mac
