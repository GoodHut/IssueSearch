 URL : "https://github.com/i40-Tools/SemCPS/issues/23" TITLE : writting proper comments BODY : ideally, we should follow best practices to write comments the description has not to be that long, but the parameters, as well as, the input and output should be as in the example as described here http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/index-137868.html . format of a doc comment a doc comment is written in html and must precede a class, field, constructor or method declaration. it is made up of two parts -- a description followed by block tags. in this example, the block tags are @param, @return, and @see. / returns an image object that can then be painted on the screen. the url argument must specify an absolute {@link url}. the name argument is a specifier that is relative to the url argument. <p> this method always returns immediately, whether or not the image exists. when this applet attempts to draw the image on the screen, the data will be loaded. the graphics primitives that draw the image will incrementally paint on the screen. @param url an absolute url giving the base location of the image @param name the location of the image, relative to the url argument @return the image at the specified url @see image / public image getimage url url, string name { try { return getimage new url url, name ; } catch malformedurlexception e { return null; } }
