 URL : "https://github.com/ga-wdi-exercises/project3/issues/525" TITLE : nested route id issue BODY : we have pushed our latest code to the 'development' branch for reference, but: - we are trying to nest the artwork show views under museum show parents - on the museum show page http://localhost:8080/ /museums/1 , each artwork is rendered properly, but the routes are pulling the artwork id instead of the museum id. e.g. when you hover over image 1, it says http://localhost:8080/ /museums/1/artworks/1, but artwork 2 says http://localhost:8080/ /museums/2/artworks/2 - weirdly, the view is rendering properly on the artwork show pages, but we are getting errors in our console because the app is looking for museums/2 which does not exist. any guidance on pulling the correct id for the parent element?
