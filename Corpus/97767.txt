BODY : hello! first of all, thank you for the awesome library! it's been really fun to use. : i have a question regarding comments: how would i go about implementing them? would i need to make a custom lexer? because the language i'm trying to implement has multicharacter tokens, and i'd figure it would be hard to implement the lexer because of that just to add comments. possibly it's a setting in the grammar; statement of the lalrpop file and i'm not aware of it. speaking of which, where can i read about the grammar; statement and params? :+1:
