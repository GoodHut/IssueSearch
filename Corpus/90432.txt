 URL : "https://github.com/rdesktop/rdesktop/issues/214" TITLE : shell command not working BODY : i am unable to get the -s shell parameter working. e.g. the following does not work: rdesktop -u <user>-p <password>-s calc.exe <ip> it does connect an rdp session, but never launches calc.exe . testing against windows 7 and windows server 2008 r2. can someone confirm this is supposed to work out of the box on a windows 7/windows server 2008 r2 machine? since i do not find issues with this on the internet, i suspect there must be something specific to my test machines. are there any conditions required for this to work? how can i further debug this?
