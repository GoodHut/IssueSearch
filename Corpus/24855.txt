 URL : "https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-weekly/issues/29" TITLE : truncated rss feed BODY : i'd love to read the entire nixos weekly in my feed reader. is there a reason why you don't allow that? i know many commercial websites only use a truncated feed to force you to click on their site and watch the adds, but there is nothing here, so i don't see any harm in putting the whole article in the feed.
