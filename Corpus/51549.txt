BODY : hi, i wonder if it could be possible to re-assign the gryo functions? if i select the 'use as mouse' option under the gryro menu, tilting the controller left and right only works if i hold it with the light bar facing straight up towards the ceiling. would it be possible to have the tilt left and right function work if i'm holding the controller with the light bar facing straight ahead, towards the monitor? thanks again.
