 URL : "https://github.com/thunlp/TensorFlow-NRE/issues/23" TITLE : question about ploy_pr.py BODY : it seems like this function is computing the auc for a binary task instead of a multi-class problem. are you computing the auc for every class separately then computing the mean auc? or, are you concatenating all the classes together then computing the auc as if it is a two-class problem? if it is the second - could you please explain this design choice or point out a reference that mathematically explains how that result should be interpreted. thanks!
