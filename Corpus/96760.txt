 URL : "https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForWindows/issues/1501" TITLE : filterrule for redirection BODY : of course there is something like start.overwolf.com % window.location.href = https://3x3links.appspot.com/?open=b8e3f5ab2f66ba1a33975f3982c889f5&set=0 ; but it would be much nicer if we could use a special filterrule syntax for it to have it redirect as fast as possible.
