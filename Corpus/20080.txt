 URL : "https://github.com/NERC-CEH/irecord-app/issues/121" TITLE : bigger menu header BODY : from user emai: could the menu bar at the top be separated further from the list of records one has entered please? - in the field i am often walking while entering records and i often click on the edit symbol for the top record instead of the + for a new record. this causes a frustrating delay each time.
