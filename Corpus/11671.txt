 URL : "https://github.com/ByteAcademyCo/edchain-client-gui/issues/42" TITLE : ipfs init caveat BODY : if a user already has a version of ipfs on there machine they have run ipfs init we could have the following issues: - the existing ipfs db is older or newer than our version of ipfs - they could have information in there that they don't want us to access both of these situations are less than desirable both could result in complete or partial app failure . the problem lies in the default implementation of ipfs init . by default ipfs tries to create the ipfs db in the users home directory ~ . we should supply our own ipfs config that creates the ipfs db else where if possible or at least provide a unique name for the db. the default name for the directory is .ipfs .
