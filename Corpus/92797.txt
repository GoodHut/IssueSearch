 URL : "https://github.com/june07/NiM/issues/40" TITLE : 503 error after installing BODY : when installing nim in a new chrome canary profile, http://june07.com/blog/nim-install opens in a new tab served by heroku with a 503 application error . the nim icon still appears in my toolbar and the popup still displays properly, so i'm guessing it's just a server issue in your post installation site.
