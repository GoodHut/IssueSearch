 URL : "https://github.com/tsherif/picogl.js/issues/31" TITLE : 3 style change proposals BODY : @tsherif let me preface this by saying these ideas are in the realm of very trivial style changes. if you don't want to pursue them no big deal. that said, would you be open to removing unnecessary semicolon use and switching to single quotes? e.g., javascript this.canvas = canvas this.gl = canvas.getcontext 'webgl2', contextattributes looks slightly cleaner than: javascript this.canvas = canvas; this.gl = canvas.getcontext webgl2 , contextattributes ;
