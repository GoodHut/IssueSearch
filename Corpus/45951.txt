 URL : "https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/issues/174" TITLE : janus as an rdf store BODY : there seems to be a significant difference in the implementation of graph/property stores and rdf stores . is janus a graph/property store or an rdf store ? or can it work with both models? for example, can i load rdf dumps such as dbpedia and wikidata, and submit sparql queries to it?
