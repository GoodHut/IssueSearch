 URL : "https://github.com/DataTables/Buttons/issues/124" TITLE : complex headers in exports BODY : complex headers containing multiple rows and columns with varying colspan does not show up in exports. it would be great if we got an exported version of the table containing all information in the table. currently, only my last header row shows up. the colspan in .csv issue could be solved by appending empty cells, or by adding the same content-holding cell _ colspan _ times for instance.
