 URL : "https://github.com/alexchiri/format-sql-alfred-workflow/issues/2" TITLE : copy to clipboard BODY : this works great! but is there any possibility of getting a copy to clipboard behavior, instead of only pasting to the active app? sometimes i would rather, when the api sends back formatted sql, have that formatted sql automatically copied to clipboard replacing unformatted sql ... so i can paste it myself somewhere.
