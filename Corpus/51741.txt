 URL : "https://github.com/osrg/gobgp/issues/1457" TITLE : better api for addpath BODY : i was able to use gobgpdas a tutorial for a nanog hackathon, however there were a couple shortfalls when using a gobgpd as a base for automation. the largest issue was how difficult it was to add new routes using the grpc api. minus the lack of package level documentation . https://github.com/nemith/nanog71/blob/master/pkg/bgpctrl/main.go this was difficult when using go, but near impossible when using other client languages. i would imagine this would take a lot more modeling of routes and attributes required inside protobuf. any may help here? https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3 any
