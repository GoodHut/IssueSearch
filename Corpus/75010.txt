 URL : "https://github.com/ac2cz/FoxTelem/issues/412" TITLE : fox-1e experiment labels BODY : the named experiment windows on the vu rad tab for 1e are labelled wrong. they do not match up with the active board number, the vu experiment n windows nor with what vanderbilt calls them. lepf is experiment 2. lep is experiment 3. rem is experiment 4. of course they still don't have data in them either, but i realize you are waiting for vanderbilt to provide that.
