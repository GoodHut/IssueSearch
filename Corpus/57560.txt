BODY : first of all. thanks for sharing this : i have modeled a part in solidworks and i have access to a cnc machine controled by mach3 software. see this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ntruodfmau for what i'm trying to do. if i understand correctly. to use this postprocessor. i need to install it as instructed in the readme file, choose the mach3 machine in solidcam and then export the gcode. is there a way to simulate the code outside of solidcam, using the exported gcode files, for verification before taking them to the machine? does the postprocessor support face and milling operations from solidcam? those kind of operations are the ones i'm using thanks in advance for any help! :
