 URL : "https://github.com/joyent/pgstatsmon/issues/3" TITLE : need a test suite BODY : we should add a test suite to pgstatsmon. my thought is that we could require the user to have a postgres instance set up and configured in the etc/config.json config file. the tests would: stand up an instance of pgstatsmon pointing to the postgres instance in the config file create some tables in postgres to use for testing write some dummy values to the testing tables make sure pgstatsmon is able to pick up the correct stats this will probably mean the test suite runs the same queries that pgstatsmon tries to run, and compares the results we should probably implement joyent/node-artedi 9 to make this easier tear down the testing tables, close the testing connection to pg, and shut down pgstatsmon we'll have to make doubly sure that the teardown steps run even in the event of failures. this might end up looking a lot like joyent/moray-test-suite.
