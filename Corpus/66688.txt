 URL : "https://github.com/desktop/desktop/issues/2609" TITLE : new feature: custom css BODY : concept: with lower quality monitors and bright ambient lighting, the github desktop file-diff colors can be difficult to differentiate from the white background because of the low contrast. so i started developing a pr which would allow users to pick a custom css file and wanted to get community feedback on the new feature before continuing. right now github has plans to develop a dark mode see a pr request for a dark mode https://github.com/desktop/desktop/pull/2111 and another discussion https://github.com/desktop/desktop/issues/2557 issuecomment-325230725 , but the limiting factor is their bandwidth to implement the feature compared to other higher priority tasks. feature: what if the alternative styling was user contributed? users could create custom css file and share their version through a github gist. in github desktop, my pr adds a text input box to the advanced pane of the preferences ui. in the text box, any user can paste the link to a github gist or path to a local css file and the file would be downloaded and loaded by webpack. since the css file could be shared as a gist, the latest version could be pulled to keep all users up to date. examples: there are several examples of custom css such as nylas/n1 https://github.com/nylas-mail-lives/nylas-mail themes , a plugin for safari/chrome/etc. called stylish https://userstyles.org , and not to mention all of the customization for atom, sublime, and other code editors. i think this would be a cool feature and would be kind of fun to see what the open source community comes up with <!-- ! from the pr https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7467062/27514004-63d87f88-5942-11e7-8cad-a234ffe1733f.png -->
