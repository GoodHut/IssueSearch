 URL : "https://github.com/sahib/rmlint/issues/227" TITLE : exit if invalid path given BODY : thanks for this great software. i'd suggest that rmlint should exit immediately if any of the paths given on the command line is invalid, rather than continuing to scan as it currently does. this could be overridden by a command-line option to ignore invalid paths, but i think the default behavior should be to exit so that time isn't wasted on a scan if the user made a typing error. a related issue is that when the -g switch is given, error messages for invalid paths are not shown. since i was in the habit of always using the -g switch to show the progress bar, it took me several minutes to realize that i had a spelling error in a pathname, because i wasn't seeing any error message. take away the -g switch and the warning message appears.
