 URL : "https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues/1601" TITLE : python 2 import ssl BODY : on a fresh 64-bit install of anconda2 4.3.1 with python 2 2.7.13 on windows 10, i get the following error: >>> import ssl traceback most recent call last : file <stdin> , line 1, in <module> file c:\users\username_redacted\anaconda2\lib\ssl.py , line 133, in <module> protocol_sslv23 = protocol_tls nameerror: name 'protocol_tls' is not defined i realise there are a few postings about ssl problems with python in anaconda that could be related: i've already tried running things like conda update openssl , i don't have certifi installed, and pip install ssl doesn't work since ssl is bundled with python now, i guess . does anyone have any ideas? i'd be very grateful for some advice, and i'm sorry if i've missed something obvious. i may be a little slow to reply as i'm about to go travelling for a while. thank you!!!
