 URL : "https://github.com/webrecorder/webrecorder/issues/450" TITLE : docker install problem BODY : i'm having trouble with the docker install. all appears to go ok, but accessing localhost:8089 gives me a 500 error. if i look through the docker logs the only container showing any errors is webrecorder_app, which has: traceback most recent call last : file ./webrecorder/main.py , line 4, in <module> from webrecorder.appcontroller import appcontroller file ./webrecorder/appcontroller.py , line 17, in <module> from pywb.rewrite.templateview import jinjaenv importerror: no module named 'pywb.rewrite.templateview' unable to load app 0 mountpoint='' callable not found or import error docker-compose doesn't seem to have had any problem with pywb, eg: building app step 1 : from webrecorder/pywb ---> 0ac4e6bb4d3a so i don't see why this would be, and i don't have the experience with docker to know how to debug further. this is on centos 7, which defaults to python 2.7; i have installed python 3.5.4 and symlinked /usr/bin/python to python3.5 ditto with pip . there is a version of pywb installed with pip for python3.5. i'm running the docker commands with sudo as it seems to be the only way it will work.
