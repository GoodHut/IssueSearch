 URL : "https://github.com/dangrossman/bootstrap-daterangepicker/issues/1625" TITLE : ranges and apply BODY : hello, i successfully implemented ranges with ng2-datarangepicker / bootstrap-daterangepicker. they are correctly displayed and when i click on them, the range is selected. i would like to change a bit the behavior and not close the range picker dialog when clicking on a range but only display the range on the picker. the ranger dialog would be closed when clicking on the apply button... is something possible using configuration only? thanks very much for your answer!
