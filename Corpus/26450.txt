 URL : "https://github.com/evilsocket/bettercap/issues/412" TITLE : avoid using rubydns BODY : it seems that rubydns is not well supported. there is a nasty crash which has been reported a year ago and hasn't been fixed. see the following 2 links: https://github.com/ioquatix/rubydns/pull/57 https://github.com/ioquatix/rubydns/issues/61 rubydns also depends on buggy celluloid which also unable to resolve major issues for the last two years: https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid/issues/698 so the whole story looks very messy. i would suggest to find an alternative solution.
