 URL : "https://github.com/kikinteractive/kik-python/issues/43" TITLE : resource not found BODY : hello, my issue is not necessarily with the package but rather the api. since there is not ticketing system on kik to be found anywhere, i've opted for this route. maybe you guys can bother them better. if i accidentally use a wrong url i'll receive the following html content: b'<html> <head> <title>404 not found</title> </head> <body> <h1>404 not found</h1> the resource could not be found.<br /><br /> </body> </html for example: https://api.kik.com/v1/user/ wrong_user_id for an api this really annoying, as i'd rather have a json in every event.
