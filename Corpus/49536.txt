 URL : "https://github.com/tosher/Mediawiker/issues/118" TITLE : turn off/delay popups BODY : the popups that come up when the mouse is over certain wiki markup elements are useful in many instances but they can also be very distracting and even may cause the configurator gui to hide sometimes . could there be an option to turn them off completely or at least a setting to adjust its delay?
