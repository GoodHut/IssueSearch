 URL : "https://github.com/vispy/vispy/issues/1348" TITLE : gimp as vispy context BODY : hello everyone. i wonder if it's possible to use a gimp drawing as the context to open vispy, how if so, and if not, if this will be implemented and when. excuse me for asking here, but this may be the only question i have about vispy and creating an account for just 5 usage minutes is not an option for me.
