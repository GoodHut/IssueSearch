 URL : "https://github.com/hrydgard/ppsspp/issues/9596" TITLE : custom settings patches BODY : when creating custom settings, it saves all settings for that game so when a user changes something for all games, i wouldn't apply to the custom settings game . i would rather see something like patches , where you could change everything but when one game needs something like control changes or a hack it would overwrite that on top of the global settings.
