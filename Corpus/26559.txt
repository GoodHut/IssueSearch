 URL : "https://github.com/twigjs/twig.js/issues/519" TITLE : blocks in for-loops BODY : hello, it seems that if i use embed in a for-loop any blocks are ignored. twig file1 <div>{% block content %}file 1{% endblock %}</div> twig file2 {% for i in 1..3 %} {% embed 'file1' %} {% block content %}file 2{% endblock %} {% endembed %} {% endfor % the expected result would be html <div>file 2</div> <div>file 2</div> <div>file 2</div> but it is html <div>file 1</div> <div>file 1</div> <div>file 1</div> my twig.js version is 1.10.4. i think i read a closed issue on something like that but thought it was fixed at the time. now can anyone tell me if i am doing something wrong?
