 URL : "https://github.com/Yalir/sfeMovie/issues/103" TITLE : huge texture update queue BODY : if video stream is not updated every frame or process was resumed after suspension, opengl command queue will be filled with huge amount of texture updating commands. situation is common if you use debugger in my case, vs debugger and gdebugger . maybe it is how it should be, but this situation is not good for my project. http://i.imgur.com/xeinz0r.png
