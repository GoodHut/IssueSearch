 URL : "https://github.com/mrmckain/annoBTD/issues/1" TITLE : licence for annobtd BODY : we would like to use annobtd to automatically annotate plasmid sequences. therefore, i am interested how annobtd is licenced? i would suggest to add a licence file or include the licence into the source code. that would allow us to decide if we can use it or not. thanks in advance!
