 URL : "https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/DynamicalBilliards.jl/issues/39" TITLE : create true finitewall BODY : 1. rename finitewall to infinitewall 2. create a finitewall . 3. the collision time will return inf if the collision happens at a point which does not belong to the actual length of the wall. 4. this will be only a small amount of additional operations, and will allow the creation of non-convex billiards, like the mushroom one.
