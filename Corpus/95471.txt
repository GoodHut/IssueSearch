 URL : "https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/2968" TITLE : dataloader and halftensors BODY : this snippet is from dataloader: numel = sum x.numel for x in batch storage = batch 0 .storage ._new_shared numel out = batch 0 .new storage if batch = torch.floattensor 4,10 it works perfectly but if batch = torch.halftensor 4,10 it throws: > typeerror: torch.halftensor constructor received an invalid combination of arguments - got torch.halfstorage , but expected one of: > no arguments > int ... didn't match because some of the arguments have invalid types: torch.halfstorage > torch.halftensor viewed_tensor didn't match because some of the arguments have invalid types: torch.halfstorage > torch.size size didn't match because some of the arguments have invalid types: torch.halfstorage > torch.halfstorage data didn't match because some of the arguments have invalid types: torch.halfstorage > sequence data didn't match because some of the arguments have invalid types: torch.halfstorage maybe there is some version of the halftensor constructor missing, or am i missing something?
