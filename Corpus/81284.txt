 URL : "https://github.com/box/box-java-sdk/issues/446" TITLE : where's the jwt support? BODY : i would like to do jwt authentication using the sdk, and it would be extremely helpful if there were some features that helped me generate the required jwt using the box-specific parameters such as box_sub_type, the correct iss value, and most importantly, support for rs256 keys. right now, i'm wallowing in a swamp of code trying to get this thing working with jwt and i know that this would not be happening if there were proper support for this in the sdk.
