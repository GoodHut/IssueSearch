 URL : "https://github.com/osevg/openshifter/issues/6" TITLE : ssh host key checking BODY : for the use-case of the tool we ignore host key checking, as gce very often gives the same ip address when tearing down and setting up the cluster in a short period of time and asking the user for validating the change of the a hostkey would be counter-productive. imho in the case we prefer simplicity over strict security. @mhausenblas @jorgemoralespou what do you think?
