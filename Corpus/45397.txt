 URL : "https://github.com/danvim/Procal/issues/10" TITLE : hyp trigonometric key BODY : ideally: if hyp is off {key sin has shift asin, key cos has shift acos, key tan has shift atan} key hyp changes these three buttons to point to another json object respectively: if hyp is on {key sinh has shift asinh, key cosh has shift acosh, key tanh has shift atanh} simpler way: make hyp shift {sinh, cosh, tanh, asinh, acosh, atanh} issue being popupwindow may not be able to handle all these in one row.
