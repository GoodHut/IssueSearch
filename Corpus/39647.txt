 URL : "https://github.com/rotty/zmq-tokio/issues/1" TITLE : some api suggestions BODY : hello i was reading through the code as it is already written because i might find a use for it sometime soon and i'd have a few suggestions, if i may i wanted to discuss them first, before i start making pull requests . basically, it's almost what i need, except that i'd like to be able to both receive and send multipart messages â€’ not only receive them. would you agree if i provided the code? furthermore, i noticed some todo notes about using a codec https://github.com/rotty/zmq-tokio/blob/master/src/lib.rs l122 . i believe codec is wrong thing to do because it handles framing and zmq does framing already . i think the right thing to do is simply return the vec's and convert them using .map on the stream.
