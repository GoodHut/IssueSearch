 URL : "https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/issues/2095" TITLE : inline svg not displayed BODY : i noticed an issue with this so i made a simple test case. take the following .adoc file: = svg bug? |=== | regular | image:lo5.svg width= 100% |=== |=== | inline | image:lo5.svg width= 100% ,opts= inline |=== i exported a libreoffice draw document as an svg and named it lo5.svg. zipped up here https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/files/861663/lo5.svg.zip the top one displays just fine, the bottom one is empty. looking at the source, the svg looks to be there. am i doing something wrong or is there some weird thing about how lo generates svgs that breaks this? i'm running 1.5.5 from gem on debian jessie.
