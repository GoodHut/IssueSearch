 URL : "https://github.com/Sonarr/Sonarr/issues/2151" TITLE : webui stops responding. BODY : the sonarr webui appears to stop responding when running on systems that also use mono based applications such as radarr and jackett . restarting the nzbdrone service works temporarily. checking the main log shows no errors and the underlying application works fine, grabbing releases and processing them, it is only the interface that fails. happy to provide anything you need.
