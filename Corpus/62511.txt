 URL : "https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js/issues/4325" TITLE : component shown events? BODY : java swing had component events and a method specifically: componentshown. i do see that pixi has events for 'added' and 'removed'. but is there currently a strategy in pixi to know when a displayobject is currently fully visible and connected in the display hierarchy? i want to be informed when a display object has been added and is visible - and then be able to look up an ancestor display object to attach an emitter to that ancestor. my actual goal is to emit 'view-has-entered' after a tween. i'll keep searching for an answer but i wanted to ask. if i use my own higher-level pubsub implementation i don't encounter this issue - but i'm trying to use eventemitter3 properly in pixi.
