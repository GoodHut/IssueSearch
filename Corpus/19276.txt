 URL : "https://github.com/Radarr/Radarr/issues/1793" TITLE : 3d quality profile BODY : radarr doesn't check for 3d tags, or have a separate quality profile for it. i could block the tag, but i do desire some movies in 3d making it a chore to manage in radarr as some titles are mistakenly downloaded in 3d, while others that i want in 3d i have to get manually. related; 3d comes in full/half sbs side by side and top/bottom. radarr should know the difference between these 3 formats and only download the correct one. radarr version: radarr ver. 0.2.0.778 logs: n/a
