 URL : "https://github.com/dutchsteve/prj-rev-bwfs-dasmoto/issues/5" TITLE : id vs class BODY : don't repeat ids. you have 3 elements with the same id of price . i assume it's because you copy/pasted the repeating content, but you have to keep in mind that an id is supposed to be unique to the page. if you have duplicate ids, you will run into some unexpected behaviour later on when dealing with things like js. just use a class instead. https://github.com/dutchsteve/prj-rev-bwfs-dasmoto/blob/f21816f492302d49214381f3b622dd8821633613/dasmoto/index.html l14
