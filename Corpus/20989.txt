BODY : hi there, thanks for the cool library. i have an issue with labels maybe i just need a pointer at the right example/documentation . as i understand, in the examples, only the ids of the nodes are displayed i.e. converted to text elements in svg . labels from the json graph are ignored. is that right? if so, how would i display the labels instead of the ids? cheers, alex
