 URL : "https://github.com/vatlab/SOS/issues/474" TITLE : definition of dryrun mode BODY : dryrun mode is very difficult to define because of the dynamic nature of sos. it currently, 1. does not report error is no input file is available, but the behavior is undefined if the input is provided by another step. 2. does not execute most actions action return none . 3. does not verify output file 4. does not check or save signature i am wondering if we should get rid of 1, because a dag cannot be built correctly without 1. then 3 would have to be a touch function to generate intended output so satisfy the input of next step .
