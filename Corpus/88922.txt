 URL : "https://github.com/kframework/plutus-core-semantics/issues/1" TITLE : parsing a list of numbers BODY : the two sample programs in test , int-addition.plcore and float-addition.plcore fail to kast. the issue seems to be that the list delimiter is a single space as defined in syntax tmlist ::= list{tm, } which causes an ambiguity when combined with the regular expression for float s. for example, parsing the following expression builtin addfloat 2.0 results in an ambiguity between __ token float@float-syntax, 2.0 ,.list{ __ } and __ token integer@plutus-core-syntax, 2 ,__ token float@float-syntax, .0 ,.list{ __ } help would be appreciated. /cc: @msaxena2 @cos @daejunpark @radumereuta
