 URL : "https://github.com/magit/magit/issues/3015" TITLE : verifying tag signatures BODY : magit provides some support for verifying commit signatures they are shown either in green or red in the log if the option -s is provided . however no such feature exists for tags. there is a tool git-verify-tag https://git-scm.com/docs/git-verify-tag whose output looks like this: $ git verify-tag v0 gpg: signature made 03/02/17 16:38:10 paris, madrid gpg: using rsa key 8dd4d303141f56b7 gpg: can't check signature: no public key alternatively, the -v option of git-tag provides an output similar to this one. could it be possible to integrate that into magit?
