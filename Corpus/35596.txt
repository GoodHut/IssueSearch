 URL : "https://github.com/uecode/qpush-bundle/issues/123" TITLE : error queue fallback BODY : hello, is it possible to define in config the error queue fallback when messages are deleted after n failed retries ? it seems that the option exists on ironmq interface, but i haven't seen in it nor in qpush-bundle, nor in qpush bundle nor in ironmq library the parameter to set it. if such an option exists, is there an api to query this error queue to get informations about failed messages ? thank you for your help.
