 URL : "https://github.com/wrey75/johannes/issues/4" TITLE : create a data manager BODY : a data manager is necessary to save data dynamically like users and other stuff . the idea behind is to have an agnostic data manager able to link with both document-oriented databases like mongodb or sql tables when possible mysql or postgres databases . we have 2 solutions: - having a very smart way to manipulate values like key/values. this is a good way to do with very simple index capabilities but who cares? - relying on dao data access object interfaces providing a set of capabilities to expand manually. the second solution based on interfaces doesn't seem the good way because we should offer capabilities to third party plugins and themes.
