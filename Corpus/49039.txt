 URL : "https://github.com/howtowhale/dvm/issues/169" TITLE : support edge releases BODY : docker has stopped publishing experimental builds to a static location. now they publish edge https://docs.docker.com/edge/ builds to https://download.docker.com/linux/static/edge/x86_64/, under named releases. the edge builds are only vaild for a month, and older edge releases will not match the eventual stable release under the same name. so we only care about the latest edge release. i'm thinking that we should drop experimental now that docker is calling it edge , something like: dvm install edge that will list the edge versions available and install the highest one.
