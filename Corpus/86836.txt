 URL : "https://github.com/grant-strayvoltage/gameoff/issues/2" TITLE : improve platform movement BODY : setup moving platforms so the platform itself doesn't collide with static map tiles/etc. possibly use sensors or another approach to move and line up properly with stop points. right now they have friction against walls etc. and don't move correctly. also probably need to make sure they are very large mass, otherwise players on them etc. will make them move different than expected.
