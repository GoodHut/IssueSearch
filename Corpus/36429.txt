 URL : "https://github.com/richdynamix/magestead/issues/96" TITLE : help! hard disk full BODY : i now have a few magento installs, which are remotely mounted but i think the mysql databases have grown quite large and i've just installed elastic search which has maxed out the drive. i've been able to login to the box and remove temp files but services are still not starting, is there a way to increase the disk size? thanks
