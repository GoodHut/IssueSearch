 URL : "https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/issues/5537" TITLE : bots are getting banned BODY : i've made a bot account for hot products from product hunt - @producthuntbot, and it has been deleted. i'm trying to figure out why, it didn't break any rules as far as i know. a very similar bot, @hackernewsbot keeps working without any problems. i would really love to be able to subscribe to a timeline of ph updates, and maybe make similar accounts for some rss and twitter feeds i want to follow. are there any guidelines for making bots that i should know about? can you guys help me find out what went wrong? - x i searched or browsed the repoâ€™s other issues to ensure this is not a duplicate.
