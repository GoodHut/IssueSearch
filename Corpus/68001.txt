 URL : "https://github.com/databricks/spark-redshift/issues/327" TITLE : redshift load - timeout BODY : hi, i am loading a redshift table ~300+ million records into hdfs in parquet format, but my job is getting timed out after 5 minutes. i am running spark-redshift job on in-house cdh cluster not on ec2 , and i set tcpkeepaliveminutes=6000&tcpkeepalive=true in jdbc connection url. but after every 5 mins it's starting a unload statement and eventually failing. is there any configuration i am missing ? i am using spark-1.6.0 and redshiftjdbc4-1.1.17 .jar
