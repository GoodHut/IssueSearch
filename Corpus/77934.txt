 URL : "https://github.com/zserge/webview/issues/21" TITLE : osx: several ui nitpicks BODY : - when the window starts, it would be nice to detach from terminal and set focus on it - mouse pointer to change its shape to resize when it is close to the window edges - just like all other windows behave - when above the web view, mouse pointer does not change its shape as it should - e.g. above the hyper links, i expect it to change to the pointer shape
