 URL : "https://github.com/PopcornTimeTV/PopcornTimeTV/issues/365" TITLE : unable to install BODY : i tried installing too and have similar issues. first of all the documentation seems incomplete. when doing swift install.swift i'm asked to enter a version number. docs didn't mention this so i just picked the highest 3.0.0 . during installation i get a few red messages like - swiftkvc ~> 3.0.1 required by podfile . in the end i also get this: opening xcode... -c , open popcorntime.xcworkspace the file /users/nick/documents/xcode/popcorntimetv/popcorntime.xcworkspace does not exist.
