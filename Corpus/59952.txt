 URL : "https://github.com/fenneclab/hugo-bin/issues/33" TITLE : versioning and updates BODY : although hugo-bin is very useful and helps me build my website easily it's versioning is confusing. i'd like to propose mirroring hugo versions, so hugo-bin v0.29 would ship hugo v0.29. old versions < 0.17 might be left intact. i think this would ease reasoning about hugo-bin and would allow development of auto-publishing mechanism.
