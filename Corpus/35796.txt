 URL : "https://github.com/Just-Some-Bots/MusicBot/issues/919" TITLE : feature shuffle play BODY : hey, i found this bot recently and started using it for discord and really liking it, but i am wondering about something. is it possible to add a shuffle play and or shuffle skip command? the basic reason i'm asking is because i'd like to randomize playlists before they start playing. currently i can't do that, because it starts playing the first song in the playlist before i can pause or shuffle the playlist.
