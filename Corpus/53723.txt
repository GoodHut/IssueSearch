 URL : "https://github.com/Raylehnhoff/XMR-Stak-Monitor/issues/10" TITLE : error object... errors BODY : just noticed that the error counts are off. on my one miner, it's had 7 errors, but on the dashboard it shows it only having two. it looks like the json from the api isn't being parsed appropriately as it only lists object object when i bring up the details for the host on the dashboard. there are two of those and i'm assuming those are the error types as this host has had 1 error of one type and 6 errors of the other. the json for the error log that it's parsing: error_log : { count :6, last_seen :1514389514, text : block expired },{ count :1, last_seen :1514386419, text : amd invalid result } }
