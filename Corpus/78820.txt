 URL : "https://github.com/CCI-MOC/GUI-Backend/issues/15" TITLE : removal of admin account BODY : there are a few functions the admin account is used for that can be done with using either the user account or data that is currently in the database. these are: 1 initial retrieval of images 2 creation of user accounts and quotas when a user logs in. 1 can be done with data that is in the database when there is no valid auth token before someone has logged in . i have coded for 2 with the previous version of our code base and am in the process to confirm that is fully merged with our current code base.
