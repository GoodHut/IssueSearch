 URL : "https://github.com/2graphic/sinap-ide/issues/175" TITLE : tsfmt is doing weird shit BODY : it seems like it is trying to change every file when i build on my desktop. i have absolutely no idea what it is doing because when i look at the diff, i can not find out what has changed. it works normally on my laptop which is also windows and this happens even with a fresh clone from github.
