 URL : "https://github.com/mverleg/pyjson_tricks/issues/34" TITLE : enum support by default BODY : hi, since python 3.4 we can create enum natively with the enum package. this feature is also available with enum34 https://pypi.org/project/enum34/ for previous versions of python. i think this can be useful to include enum support directly in json-tricks. since i had to write an implementation for that today, i'll gladely contribute if you want.
