 URL : "https://github.com/etherdelta/etherdelta.github.io/issues/299" TITLE : ed smart contract orders BODY : from the api docs: > etherdelta's orderbook is an off-chain mechanism a list of cryptographically signed orders that you can only access through this api. the api allows you to see existing orders or place a new one. i notice that the smart contract has an order method and order event. is this unused/not recommended? i'm interested for two reasons 1 testing my code on ropsten and 2 listening to the order events directly rather than using the web socket. forgive me if my assumptions are wildly off. i'm new to working with ethereum.
