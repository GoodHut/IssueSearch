 URL : "https://github.com/I2PC/scipion/issues/1115" TITLE : volume wizards issue BODY : i might be missing something, but in 1.1 version the filter wizard shows incorrect image on the left panel - it looks like masked something... this is the case with all wizards working on volumes. when i look at the volume itself it looks fine. ! screenshot_20170712_155500 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6952870/28128891-32641f58-6729-11e7-9546-c444941b7492.png
