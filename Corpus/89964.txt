 URL : "https://github.com/BohemianCoding/developer.sketchapp.com/issues/105" TITLE : resizing mask information BODY : it's possible this exists within the sketch api already and i just can't find the documentation - but is there any way to access information on resizing masks programmatically via the api? the availability of that information opens up a ton of possibilities for things like design -> prototype.
