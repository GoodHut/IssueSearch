 URL : "https://github.com/suiji/Arborist/issues/32" TITLE : state of py-lang support BODY : rudimentary python support appears to be available. thanks go out to @mjuarezm for independently testing the code and, especially, to @fyears for the working implementation. kudos also to chetan mishra, who first studied the problem. the working implementation is built from an older version of the core code, so suffers from some important deficiencies: sparse data is not supported. one-hot encodings, in particular, will run more slowly and consume much more memory than running under the r counterpart. restaging employs an older greedy algorithm. high-dimensional data sets will run noticeably slower in the py versions, especially in classification. more recent versions of the core have cut down significantly on irregular memory accesses. in particular, the py versions are not expected to scale as well. a peppier version of pyborist , then, awaits some refactoring.
