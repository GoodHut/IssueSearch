 URL : "https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/kaiju/issues/20" TITLE : kaiju and conda BODY : hi, i've been trying to get kaiju to work as a package in bioconda, but i've been having some problems with the makedb script. the issue is explained here: https://bitbucket.org/snakemake/snakemake/issues/465/conda-and-symbolic-links. could you maybe consider other solutions than using e.g. $scriptdir/convertnr, such as first checking if it's on path? or maybe there can be a solution with readlink? thanks! cheers, rasmus
