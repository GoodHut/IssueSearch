 URL : "https://github.com/GreatEmerald/UT3Vehicles/issues/132" TITLE : cicada rocket launchers BODY : - animation related - launchers come disconnected from the metal bar when turning - in ut3 the launchers only move up and down while in ut2004 they move in every direction, might explain why they disconnect so badly in ut2004...also want to mention it looks like only the 2 launchers move and the bars they are attached to don't....launchers are also slightly in a slanted outward direction at all times in ut3 - sound related - alt fire missile loaded sound is there on 32 and 64 bit but it's very quiet unlike ut3 which is very easy to hear, sound file might need volume increase if it can't be done in code - rocket explosion sound isn't the same as ut3, ut3 sounds like a ut3 rocket
