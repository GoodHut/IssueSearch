 URL : "https://github.com/rodrigosetti/stamps/issues/15" TITLE : add z-order adjustments BODY : this example would really benefit from a z-order adjustment: https://github.com/ericclack/racket-stamps-examples/blob/master/examples/eye1.rkt ...so that the pupil appears in front of the iris. i'm going to explore adding this adjustment, maybe by storing a dictionary of queues in path-record, keyed on z-index. let me know what you think... -eric.
