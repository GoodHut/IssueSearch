 URL : "https://github.com/Lora-net/LoRaMac-node/issues/376" TITLE : class c and join issue BODY : if i set my device as class c before initiate join procedure, after a successful join the radio is in sleep mode. in other words, i will have to set my device to class c again. i've tracked down the issue. once i receive a rxdone interrupt loramac execute onradiorxdone . that function puts the radio in sleep. at the end the function starts the onmacstatechecktimer. onmacstatechecktimerevent checks for class c only if loramacflags.bits.mcpsind is set. if loramacflags.bits.mcpsind == 1 { if loramacdeviceclass == class_c { // activate rx2 window for class c onrxwindow2timerevent ; } if loramacflags.bits.mcpsindskip == 0 { loramacprimitives->macmcpsindication &mcpsindication ; } loramacflags.bits.mcpsindskip = 0; loramacflags.bits.mcpsind = 0; } as this was a join request the flag isn't set hence rx2 indow is never open. so my question is, is this a bug or m i supposed to change class only after a join?
