 URL : "https://github.com/information-artifact-ontology/IAO/issues/199" TITLE : dc:member does not exist BODY : what is wrong: importing http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/iao.owl results in dc:member being added as an annotation property. why: member is not defined for dublin core elements http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/ . http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/member -> 404 error. how to fix it: remove this line from ioa-merged.owl https://github.com/information-artifact-ontology/iao/blob/master/releases/2017-03-24/iao-merged.owl l620 . the underlying cause is not entirely clear to me, but it might be related to this line in generate-obo.lisp https://github.com/information-artifact-ontology/iao/blob/master/src/tools/build/generate-obo.lisp l153 . when importing http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/iao.owl i noticed a spurious dublin core annotationproperty dc:member . as far as i can tell this is not a 'real' dublin core element. this is directly cauesd by <owl:annotationproperty rdf:about= http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/member /> which occurs in ioa-merged.owl on line 620 https://github.com/information-artifact-ontology/iao/blob/master/releases/2017-03-24/iao-merged.owl l620 . i think that this is somehow being pulled in by this line in generate-obo.lisp https://github.com/information-artifact-ontology/iao/blob/master/src/tools/build/generate-obo.lisp l153 , but i could be mistaken.
