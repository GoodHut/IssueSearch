BODY : issue description: i have mekanism on 2 different modpacks both in 1.10.2. one has the wind generator in it but the other doesn't and theres probably an easy explanation but i cant figure it out lol one mod pack i downloaded the one that does have the wind gen and the other is a smaller one i put together for myself does not have wind gen when i compared the two configs the one missing the wind gen didn't have the generators section at all. i tried downloading a newer version of mekanism and even copying over the same file from the other modpack and removing the config but neither worked. the config did have a generators section after trying this but despite wind gens being enabled they still don't show up in game. steps to reproduce: _unsure ?_ version make sure you are on the latest version before reporting : forge: 12.18.3.2185 mekanism: 1.10.2-9.2.4.103 other relevant version: before was using mekanism 1.10.2-9.2.2 sorry this is more of a personal problem than a bug, just not sure where else to ask for help x.x
