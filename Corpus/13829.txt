 URL : "https://github.com/TechReborn/TechReborn/issues/1328" TITLE : 1.12.2 lesu limit BODY : if you exceed your limit with lesu blocks, your lesu will show an negative number of energy! i changed now that a lesu is 1/10 worth of energy so this happens not so early in my modpack main focused on tr, so lesu will be the first big storage . could it be limited to if max = nothing more will be added? instead of going into negative numbers.
