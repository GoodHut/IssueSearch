 URL : "https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/issues/1037" TITLE : how to hide parent header? BODY : this is my navigation architecture stacknavigator -> splash, login, signup, home home -> tabnavigator -> pageone, pagetwo, pagethree, pagefour pageone -> stacknavigator -> pageonelevelone, pageoneleveltwo, pageonelevelthree my issue is that when i'm on pageonelevelone i see 2 headers. i can hide the child header if i put { header: { visible: false } } in the screen's navigationoptions, but then if i navigate to pageoneleveltwo, i won't see the back arrow because the back arrow is in the header that i just hid the child header . i really want to hide the parent header at this point, but i can only turn it off for all screens with headermode: 'none'.. i don't really want to do that either because i need the headers for the login and signup screens. not sure what the optimal solution for this is.. is there a way i can hide the parent header on individual screens?
