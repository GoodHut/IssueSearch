 URL : "https://github.com/foliant-docs/foliant/issues/25" TITLE : remove raw latex support BODY : looks like the full latex syntax support inside a markdown file can be redundant and dangerous. it's better to remove raw_tex extension from pandoc wrapper and change it to latex_macros . we'll still have tex_math_dollars for latex math, anyway. the only flaw that blocks this issue â€” ewpage command that's used a lot in the project.
