 URL : "https://github.com/omz/Pythonista-Issues/issues/457" TITLE : the trash is missing BODY : obviously you're aware of this, but i wanted to have it listed here. the trash is a useful safety feature so that you won't lose anything if you tap the wrong button in the swipe menu. of course backups and version control exist, but it's always good to have an extra layer of protection against accidental data loss. i'm guessing part of the reason why the trash is currently missing is that it might be more difficult to implement well for the icloud folder, and because ios 11's files apparently has a built-in trash? my devices are still on ios 9/10 and many of my pythonista files are not in icloud yet, so i would find a pythonista-internal trash very useful even if it only works for local files .
