 URL : "https://github.com/jarrekk/imgkit/issues/19" TITLE : xvfb-run failed to start BODY : after using this package, i have run into an issue with the invocation of xvfb-run under the hood. each virtual headless server xvfb-run spins up will have spin down time. my script calls imgkit synchronously with repetitious invocations of the xvfb-run. the default server it tries is always the same :99 of which each new one tries this server and fails as the process is still open in memory. a sleep of 100ms has been the work around. the solution would be to tell xvfb-run with the option -a, --auto-servernum try to get a free server number, starting at 99, or the argument to --server-num. is there a way currently to pass this option down from imgkit to the xvfb-run process being called? if not, i will submit a pr of this possibility.
