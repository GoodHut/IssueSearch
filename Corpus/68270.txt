 URL : "https://github.com/einaregilsson/Redirector/issues/104" TITLE : request: comment field? BODY : i could really use a free-form comment field for each redirect. i've got some complicated regexps that need documentation because i won't be able to easily understand 6 months from now. is there any chance of a multi-line textbox for comments getting added to the edit form? thanks
