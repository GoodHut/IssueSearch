 URL : "https://github.com/mmieluch/laravel-vfs-provider/issues/4" TITLE : laravel 5.4 support BODY : with laravel 5.4 out and little to no effect on this package's compatibility, i suggest changing the composer.json from... illuminate/support : 5.0. |5.1. |5.2. |5.3. , illuminate/filesystem : 5.0. |5.1. |5.2. |5.3. , to... illuminate/support : 5.4. , illuminate/filesystem : 5.4. , and tagging this version v0.0.4 . if anyone needs 5.0-5.3 compatibility, they can use the v0.0.3 release without issue.
