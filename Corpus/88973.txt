 URL : "https://github.com/whatwg/html-build/issues/128" TITLE : pdfsizeopt is too verbose BODY : https://github.com/whatwg/html-build/pull/126 introduced a problem, namely that the logs are so verbose that travis doesn't want to load them all. that's because pdfsizeopt is very verbose, but unfortunately it doesn't have a --quiet flag or similar. @izh1979 @pts, any advice on how to get less verbose output without also hiding errors?
