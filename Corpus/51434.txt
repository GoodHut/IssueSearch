 URL : "https://github.com/stm32duino/Arduino_Core_STM32/issues/37" TITLE : analog pins definition BODY : hi all, i would like to open a discussion around the analog pins definition ax currently, we mainly defined a0 to a5 but stm2 mcu provide more than 6 adc. and in pinmap_adc https://github.com/stm32duino/arduino_core_stm32/blob/master/variants/nucleo_f429zi/peripheralpins.c l40 we make available more than a0-a5. so, constant value max_analog_ios https://github.com/stm32duino/arduino_core_stm32/blob/master/variants/nucleo_f429zi/variant.h l75 and num_analog_inputs num_analog_inputs are not aligned. questions are: is it required to define more than a0 to a5 by default ? if not then, only comment the other pins in pinmap_adc. if yes, extend the ax to the same number of pins defined in pinmap_adc. this will imply to duplicate some pin definitions in digital_arduino https://github.com/stm32duino/arduino_core_stm32/blob/master/variants/nucleo_f429zi/variant.cpp l28 array or reordering it. furthermore, after discussion with arduino developper, the analogread a0 == analogread 0 should be the same while analogwrite 0 == analogwrite d0 . for constant values, it should be changed to not use sizeof to avoid issue: define max_analog_ios aend - a0 define num_analog_inputs max_analog_ios any feedback are welcome
