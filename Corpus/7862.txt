 URL : "https://github.com/koekeishiya/khd/issues/66" TITLE : key reader mode BODY : it would be convenient if the command line tool could output the keycode or alias of key that user has just pressed. then i can throw away the above char and just type something like khd -r for read , press the keys and see what i need to put into the config file. fish does something similar with fish_key_reader .
