 URL : "https://github.com/smpallen99/ex_admin/issues/353" TITLE : error with hound.app BODY : i'm using ex_admin with github option in mix.exs. after updating ex_admin, i can no longer start my application. got this error: > mix could not start application hound: could not find application file: hound.app the issue seems related to this 346 because i tried using ex_admin with the commit right before 346 and it worked fine. i don't understand why hound is only required in test environment and it still bugging me when i'm running my application in dev mode
