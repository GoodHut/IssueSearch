 URL : "https://github.com/NCRCounterpointAPI/APIGuide/issues/63" TITLE : api 2.0 install BODY : i've been installing the updated api for several customers and it has been great. today i ran the install for a customer and it noticed that the system did not currently have .net 4.5.2 installed and had to install it first. once the install reached 99%, the system restarted without prompt. could this be enhanced so that a prompt is included before the restart or perhaps before the install is even started?
