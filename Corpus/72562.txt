 URL : "https://github.com/vecnatechnologies/quick-sip/issues/27" TITLE : can't add another bundle BODY : it seems to me that two things are preventing me from adding another bundle. 1 quick-sip doesn't return anything, therefore i can't add another bundle to it afterward 2 there are no configurations to add another bundle. to me, this highlights the biggest flaw of quick-sip. it provides quick setup but doesn't expose the configurability available in browserify.
