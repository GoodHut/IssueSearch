 URL : "https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer4.AccessTokenValidation/issues/46" TITLE : token expiry on v3 vs v4 BODY : hey, i'm using jwts. i have a project using identityserver3.accesstokenvalidation and some newer ones using version 4. if a token expires, version 3 complains in the exact amout of time that the token is invalid. on the other hand, version 4 accepts the token even some minutes after expiry. is this by design? is there a setting to controle the time padding ?
