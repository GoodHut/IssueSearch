 URL : "https://github.com/webdriverio/wddoc/issues/4" TITLE : $ instead of browser.$ BODY : for $ and $$ commands we don't need to call them within the browser scope. these commands are accessible in the global scope. people still get confused because and write browser.$ based on what is shown in the api docs http://webdriver.io/api/utility/$.html usage . we should modify the template https://github.com/webdriverio/wddoc/blob/master/templates/template.md.ejs l25 to not prepend browser in case of these 2 commands.
