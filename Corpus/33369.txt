 URL : "https://github.com/Keats/gutenberg/issues/176" TITLE : add logging to serve BODY : going off of this 166, it's a little difficult even with the available theme as to how to actually use themes. i'm making my own site with a theme that i'd like to eventually publish, but i'm having a bit of difficulty getting started still getting a white page for some reason . unfortunately, the given examples aren't of much help since they all just use templates instead of the theming system. i'm 99% sure it's user error but debugging is a little difficult! it would be nice if gutenberg serve could display a little more information either optionally or all the time - for instance, when getting a request / rendering a page if it could say what template it was rendering from, etc, to make debugging stuff easier. right now, i just get a blank page and i'm lost on what is happening behind the scenes. perhaps there's a better way to do this that i haven't found, so let me know!
