 URL : "https://github.com/meteorwebcomponents/synthesis/issues/21" TITLE : reactive data and masonry BODY : hello arun, i'm using synsthesis and trying to use masonry http://masonry.desandro.com/ to lay out my grid. but it seems there is a timing problem. if i do something like that: <div id= grid > <template is= dom-repeat id= items items= {{items}} as= item > <paper-card class= grid-item heading= item.name > <div class= card-content > <div> item.text </div> </div> </paper-card> </template> </div> how do i know if the dom is ready to initialize masonry, and how do i know if data changes are finished, because i need to perform an masonry action if items array changes. if i initialize masonry in the ready funktion i need a timeout to about 200 ms to properly lay out my elements. if i observe changes or call masonry in tracker function i also need a timeout. timeout is not optimal because you see the rearrangment of elements especially when new elements are added and sometimes it doesn't work with hot code push. do you have any ideas how i can fix this? i think meteor with blaze has onrendered for stuff like that? thank you for your time.
