 URL : "https://github.com/SpartanRefactoring/Spartanizer/issues/1081" TITLE : bug in name generation BODY : public int non int i, double b { b = i; return i; } turns to public int non int i1, double d1 { d1 = i1; return i1; } but public int non int i, int b { b = i; return i; } turns to public int non int i1, int i1 { i1 = i1; return i1; } in renaming expander 979 - which points that the problem might be in the generation of 2 different variable names of same type. i remembered that this issue was already open but couldn't find it, so if such exists, feel free to reference it and close this
