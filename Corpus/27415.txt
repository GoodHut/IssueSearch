 URL : "https://github.com/Bungie-net/api/issues/172" TITLE : d1 character lookup BODY : i was using the following endpoint to pull d1 characters for a given user: https://www.bungie.net/platform/user/getbungieaccount/<membershipid>/tigerpsn/ after the update the d1 characters are no longer there, and i'm unable to figure out a new way to pull d1 characters. i was running a competition in my clan to see who had helped the most people get a 390 raid clear. people put in a lot of work, but i did not run the final tally before the api was changed so i am trying to fix it. any advice would be helpful! thanks, john
