 URL : "https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/1226" TITLE : set image size BODY : i am using pandoc to migrate some docx files to a static site using markdown and mkdocs. however, the images are translated like this: ! images/media/image1.png {width= 3.15in height= 4.668055555555555in } we have two issues: 1. width and height attributes are not supported > ok, i can remove it. 2. if i remove the width and height attributes, there are display issues if the image is larger than expected. i would like know if there is a way to add image width and height, in a similar way pandoc is doing right now.
