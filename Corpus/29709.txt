 URL : "https://github.com/bodleian/medieval-mss/issues/104" TITLE : missing date fields BODY : i'm not sure of the effect on the web site, but the xquery script that controls what is indexed for manuscripts is looking in the tei for history/origin/date elements within msdesc and mspart sections, and finding nothing. that means nothing is being indexed in the following solr fields: ms_date_stmt_s ms_date_earliest_i ms_date_latest_i maybe these aren't needed any more anyway? or the configuration in blacklight to use them isn't there yet. either way, it isn't a current problem, but i'm creating this issue to note it for clean up or more development work later.
