 URL : "https://github.com/FSX/misaka/issues/59" TITLE : built-in xss protection BODY : in misaka 1.0 there was a safelink flag that provided a decent protection against xss attacks, but it seems to have disappeared from upstream <https://github.com/hoedown/hoedown/issues/209> . misaka 2.0 could fill the gap by providing a renderer subclass with custom autolink , image , and link methods that check urls. here's the one i've written: markdown.py https://github.com/liberapay/liberapay.com/blob/156/liberapay/utils/markdown.py . if i submit a pull request to integrate that class into misaka, will you merge it?
