 URL : "https://github.com/pardeike/CameraPlus/issues/3" TITLE : googled to get here. BODY : maybe change the name to unlimited zoom or zoom infinity or something instead of camera+, just because to find this i tried several words that would unrestrict the zooming view. i had to read 2 forums to come across a suggestion of this camera+ mod name. in all if you keep camera+ it will become recognized and more commonly known so it is awesome!
