 URL : "https://github.com/wikimedia/openzim/issues/10" TITLE : inaccessible js file BODY : every other js file that is referenced in html with a script tag is fine. however, in javascript, if you decide to request a file locally using xhr related methods , you are stuck requesting from a/ . you cannot specify a root path in this xhr request because the root path always leads to the kiwix-serve home not the individual zim's home . therefore we are stuck referencing the filepath relatively. eg: /assets/iframescripts-dff78024c9.js . tl;dr: because this is a asset file not html , it is placed in -/ where it belongs. however, javascript xhr can only relatively point to a/ and deeper. ps: i don't have a solution. but xhr in javascript is common. and ripping cc/publicdomain sites use this often and makes a pain out of this process.
