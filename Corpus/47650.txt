 URL : "https://github.com/dxinteractive/bitshift/issues/14" TITLE : preset-ish thing: lfo BODY : this'll be useful not as a preset to use directly, but as one that other presets can use, and therefore get standard paramvaluestring , setanalogparam and setmenuitemparam abilities. might need something to say not to use as a regular preset, like it's a new kind of entity that follows mostly the same api as a preset, but can not be used as a preset.
