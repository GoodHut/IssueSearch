 URL : "https://github.com/coreos/bugs/issues/1821" TITLE : support for metadata BODY : issue report feature request desired feature in order to use dynamic metadata e.g. cloud-provided ip addresses in configuration, a reasonably complex process setup must be done. ct should understand how to do this instead and allow the user to use environment variables in their config. this would also require ct knowing the target environment in order to use the correct coreos-metadata names . this removes the burned of understanding coreos-metadata from the user. off the top of my head, something like: yaml systemd: units: - name: etcd2.service enable: true dropins: - name: metadata.conf contents: | service execstart= execstart=/usr/bin/etcd2 \ --advertise-client-urls=http://{public_ipv4}:2379 \ --initial-advertise-peer-urls=http://{private_ipv4}:2380 \ --listen-client-urls=http://0.0.0.0:2379 \ --listen-peer-urls=http://{private_ipv4}:2380 \ --initial-cluster=%m=http://{private_ipv4}:2380
