_originally opened as https://github.com/compevol/beast2/issues/30_ ---- the nexus parser beast.util.nexusparser only handles a minimum subset of the nexus format. i suggest we switch to the jebl nexus parser which is much more complete handles taxa and characters blocks etc. . the wrapper class beast.app.beauti2.util.beautiparser shows how to use this to load multiple partitions from a nexus file.
