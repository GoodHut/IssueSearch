 URL : "https://github.com/ICCM-EU/BOF/issues/5" TITLE : prepare unit tests BODY : this obviously depends on the programming language we use. when that decision has been made, we can start using the spec https://github.com/iccm-eu/bof/wiki/specs-of-the-bof-application to define unit tests for various issues: calculating the order of voted sessions, calculating the rooms and slots creating a new user account etc we could prepare the code classes beforehand, with methods that don't have any functionality, but can be called from the test code. this way we have test driven development during the hackathon!
