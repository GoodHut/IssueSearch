 URL : "https://github.com/calliope-project/calliope/issues/59" TITLE : data consistency checker BODY : it would be good to create expressions to which each constraint/cost must fit e.g. text, float, integer, bool . that way, on loading a model, they can all be checked against the relevant expressions, for data consistency. this consistency checker could also check and warn about possible issues e.g. if a technology is defined, but hasn't mentioned e_cap.max/equals/min so will be ignored, or a milp tech defining units.max/min/equals hasn't defined e_cap_per_unit , etc. .
