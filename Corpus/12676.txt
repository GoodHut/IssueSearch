 URL : "https://github.com/toggl/toggldesktop/issues/2317" TITLE : record idle time BODY : there should be an option to record idle time similar to recording pomodoro breaks . this should automatically start when there's no active timer including pomodoro break running for 10 seconds or so. the elapsed 10 seconds should be recorded as well just like how pomodoro break records the 5 seconds it takes to kick in . idle time would also be logged in the same workspace with the name idle and with a tag idle-time . again, just like pomodoro break . idle time could show up as a smaller bar below the main timer bar, showing how long i have been idle for. and of course, idle notifications should show up as usual on the set schedule. since you already have idle detection, this should be easy to plug in. it would also help somewhat with the comment here https://github.com/toggl/toggldesktop/pull/1951 issuecomment-263313372 . 1951
