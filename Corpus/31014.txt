 URL : "https://github.com/Arckenver/Nations/issues/140" TITLE : request nearby flag BODY : hello, this request is to create a nearby flag on nations to allow other nations to claim nearby. this will be mostly helpful to allow new players to claim around inactive ones usually people who have been offline for +30 days . it would also be cool not completely necessary if all of the players in a nation have been offline for +30 days configurable the flag would automaticly change to true. thanks! - alice sellars dragontechmc http://dragontechmc.com btw i have been learning and practicing java a lot over the last few months, i hope to be able to make pull requests eventually instead of keep asking you to do everything!
