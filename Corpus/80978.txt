 URL : "https://github.com/UniSharp/laravel-filemanager/issues/465" TITLE : using filemanager in api BODY : hi i'm using laravel mainly as a backend service. the project's frontend is written in angular 2 and communicates through api. i wanna use the file manager in ckeditor in my frontend, admin panel mainly . but i'm stuck on what to do for it. the default web and auth middlewares will fire the error 'route login ' not found which is logical. i haven't used them . if i use only the web middleware, the error 'trying to get property of non-object' comes. for our own use, we have a custom middleware called custom_api, and when i use that, i get an error class custom_api does not exist . so basically, how can i totally disable the authentication, and write my own?
