 URL : "https://github.com/notus-sh/chapecron/issues/6" TITLE : optimize array functions BODY : array::search and array::merge in chapecron are pretty slow. the current implementation was good enough when the only use was to merge middlewares config entries from system and user configurations but take forever to deal with longer lists as the declared function list used to detect the ones that have been introduced by plugins. there should be a faster way to do that.
