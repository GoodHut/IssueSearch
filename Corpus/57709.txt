 URL : "https://github.com/DecipherNow/gm-fabric-dashboard/issues/1044" TITLE : refactor components to BODY : in our current project structure, complex components are structured as follows: /myawesomecomponent - /components - /index.js in this model the container component logic for the myawesomecomponent container is in index.js. the problem with this approach is that searching for myawesomecomponent in most editors doesn't seem to match on directory names, so it's difficult to search for the term myawesomecomponent . to address this issue, we should move the myawesomecomponent container logic into a myawesomecomponent.js file in the myawesomecomponent directory and turn the index.js sibling file into a simple file that just imports the main file and exports it back out: js import icon from ./myawesomecomponent ; export default myawesomecomponent; if there are files like index.test.js or index.stories.js , these should be renamed to myawesomecomponent.test.js or myawesomecomponent.stories.js to match, leading to a structure that resembles the following: /myawesomecomponent - /components - /myawesomecomponent.js - /myawesomecomponent.test.js - /myawesomecomponent.stories.js - /index.js
