 URL : "https://github.com/mholt/caddy/issues/1506" TITLE : add oauth2_proxy support BODY : i came across oauth2_proxy https://github.com/bitly/oauth2_proxy and was thinking it would be a really nice feature for caddy to support oauth2 authentication... since it would take yet another server and/or configuration detail away from something that needs to be added/maintained/developed.
