 URL : "https://github.com/Montana-Media-Arts/341-work/issues/17" TITLE : webpage doesn't display BODY : i change my repository to a website and pushed my index.html onto my github repository under week-3-hw directory. i can see it there and open it up. however, when i click on the page address it's a 404 error and reads: the site configured at this address does not contain the requested file. https://aroomfullofbees.github.io/341-work/week-3-hw/ could this have something to do with the .gitattributes & .gitignore files? what are those? they seem to come out of nowhere when i sync from gitdesktop. should i delete them?
