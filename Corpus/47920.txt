 URL : "https://github.com/djangopackages/djangopackages/issues/494" TITLE : rate limiting broken? BODY : i read in this issue comment https://github.com/djangopackages/djangopackages/issues/485 issuecomment-328275359 that the rate limiting is 2 per second. i'm not sure if this is working as expected because i reach this limit just by opening https://djangopackages.org/ and submitting a search e.g. https://djangopackages.org/search/?q=shop and get the 429 too many requests error which is certainly not within the same second. if that's not broken maybe an increase might be considered so the page can be used normally ? thanks!
