 URL : "https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/issues/2490" TITLE : job stats bug BODY : these are the logs from one job in pachyderm 1.6.3: started : 2017-10-30t15:27:50.073855757z , finished : 2017-10-30t16:10:57.077443322z , outputcommit : { repo : { name : xcmsfindpeakstest }, id : 3ab40acbb8c543ffa1b5ce4bc39898ec }, state : job_success , outputrepo : { name : xcmsfindpeakstest }, outputbranch : master , dataprocessed : 25 , datatotal : 25 , stats : { downloadtime : 113.759952525s , processtime : 7156.397069079s , uploadtime : 28.758669872s , downloadbytes : 1896638187 , uploadbytes : 25625050 }, note that the downloadtime+processtime+uploadtime do not match with the real total duration of the job, which can be deduced from the started and finished values. what seems to be happening is that the stats data is accumulating when reprocessing a pipeline using update-pipeline --reprocess, despite a separate independent job is created.
