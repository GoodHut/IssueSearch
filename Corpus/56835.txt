 URL : "https://github.com/tangzx/IntelliJ-EmmyLua/issues/42" TITLE : openresty remote debug BODY : when i debug in openresty it always disconnect immediately after connecting. ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14816818/29876319-fe26412c-8dce-11e7-9f7f-e464fe0aff09.png as mentioned in http://notebook.kulchenko.com/zerobrane/debugging-openresty-nginx-lua-scripts-with-zerobrane-studio > i first tried to use the non-blocking socket api that openresty provides, but couldn't get the debugging to work because socket calls that were supposed to be blocking were returning too early, which was breaking the interaction between the debugger in the application and the ide. based on advice from yichun zhang agentzh , the maintainer of the openresty bundle, i then tried to use the same luasocket library that zerobrane studio is using and got it all working. is it possible that the luasocket library in luaj engin dont match openresty
