BODY : greetings, i am the developer of the like button library you included in the xamarin android project. i am sharpening my xamarin forms skills and i have been using your code as a guide for the past few days. i was so surprised when i saw the twitter like button renderer and realized it was using my library haha. it's amazing how this platform allows us to help each other in ways we don't even know. open source rocks!
