 URL : "https://github.com/littlevgl/lvgl/issues/55" TITLE : confuse of memory defining BODY : 1. lv_mem_size this is for lvgl working needed, there are lots of dynamic ram to be allocated. 2. lv_vdb_size, lv_vdb_adr i use rgb interface in my stm32f4, so this memory is my display area. the screen will change immediately as i change something in this area. 3. screen, lv_vdb2_adr the same as vdb, another parellel memory for double buffering. when i operate vdb1, lcd controller will fetch from vdb2, and swap in next cycle. is that right?
