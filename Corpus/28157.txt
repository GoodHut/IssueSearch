 URL : "https://github.com/BSData/hobbit/issues/18" TITLE : file format problem BODY : @edhorsman i'm not sure why but it appears one or more of the hobbit files is broken, preventing the data being available on the site. have you used some external tool to modify any files? the problem is the one described here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4569123/content-is-not-allowed-in-prolog-saxparserexception basically some extra character/data has found it's way into the start of one or more files, which causes the data site to throw an error. i've seen this issue before, but i'm sure it's fixed on my end. can you make sure you have the latest version of battlescribe and go through each of the files, opening and re-saving each one. hopefully this should resolve things.
