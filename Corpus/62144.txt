 URL : "https://github.com/learning-unlimited/ESP-Website/issues/2303" TITLE : captcha in contact form BODY : we're in the 21st century, we should have a captcha in our contact form to prevent spam from non-humans. and yes, this is coming from experience somehow we are getting 5 forms submitted every minute by some chinese bot, even after overriding the template . i'd imagine it would be fairly easy to use an optional tag to implement one at least through google, it requires a domain-specific key .
