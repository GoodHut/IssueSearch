 URL : "https://github.com/rivermont/spidy/issues/20" TITLE : linux version of crawler BODY : so far spidy has been developed on windows for windows, but obviously that won't work. after doing some testing, it seems that on linux ubuntu 16.04, at least the crawler interprets folders such as config/ with the slash as part of the folder name, whereas on windows the slash is needed to indicate being a folder.
