 URL : "https://github.com/Plastix/Kotlin-Android-Boilerplate/issues/16" TITLE : fragment example on mvvm BODY : i like the boilerplate and i plan on basing my app off it, however i have a bottom navigation view with multiple views for my app, so i'd like to see a fragment example for mvvm. i'm still learning and i fear i will do it wrongly then i end up leaking and only finding out while in production.
