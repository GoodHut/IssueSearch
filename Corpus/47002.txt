 URL : "https://github.com/dmamontov/rararchiver/issues/5" TITLE : no actual compression BODY : hi, i tried this library, it nicely creates a rar archive with all files, but the compresion rate is zero - the size of the rar archive is the same as the total size of uncompressed csv files. while the size of the rar archive is e.g. _6 674 951_ bytes, the zip archive size of the same files is _377 568_ bytes. am i doing something wrong? thank you!
