 URL : "https://github.com/data-skeptic/dataskeptic.com/issues/32" TITLE : add pagination to blog BODY : blog pages should only retrieve the first 10 items. if 10 or fewer entries exist for the category, show no navigation. if 10 or more exist, show a typical navigation like this: previous 1 2 3 4 5 6 ... 99 next your changes should be confined to the files listed below, although you may introduce new files for the new navigation element. the nav should appear at the top and bottom of the list of entries. style.css add styles for the new navigation element. https://github.com/data-skeptic/dataskeptic.com/blob/master/shared/components/blog.js this file contains the logic for showing the blog and also makes a call to the get_blogs_list function. you will likely need to edit the parameters required by this function. it can be found in: https://github.com/data-skeptic/dataskeptic.com/blob/master/shared/utils/redux_loader.js this file will use my_cache when it's server side, or use the site's existing api if client side. the api supports pagination already. it accepts limit and offset . example: https://dataskeptic.com/api/blog?limit=2&offset=3 however, the api does not specify the total number of items, which will be required to determine the number of pages. you will need to enhance the api to add this feature. the function with handles the api call shown above is: https://github.com/data-skeptic/dataskeptic.com/blob/master/shared/backend/get_blogs.js
