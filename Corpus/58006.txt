 URL : "https://github.com/dulvie/emmy/issues/284" TITLE : revamp container ideas BODY : previous idea/target: - make all containers readonly, with only the required directories rw - log to host's syslog - use custom bash script to orchestrate containers - use grsec kernel during the process, i've ran into a few issues: - some daemons is tricky to get to log to stdout, they really want a /dev/log. - i was unable to get a --read-only container to have /dev writable, or even /dev/log as a volume, especially on a grsec based system. - grsec based kernel requires lots of maintenance, and the author have said that the plan is to stop the release of test-patches, which means the package in debian backports have an uncertain future. - read-only container also means no updates, to get security fixes into the container, the image have to be rebuilt and a new container started. new idea: - drop grsec, just go with the vanilla kernel. - move to debian:stretch as the base - drop --read-only and enable unattended-upgrades to get automatic security upgrades into the containers with minimal maintenance - use rsyslogd inside the containers the reasoning for this is to lower the maintenance burden. automatic upgrades are a deal-breaker imho
