 URL : "https://github.com/zibings/stoic-php-chain/issues/5" TITLE : generic dispatch proposal BODY : this proposal is to create a generic dispatch that could store dynamic data in an array. the dispatch could then pass that dynamic data along the chain. this generic dispatch would basically serve as an out of the box solution for developers to get started with. the dispatch would need to have methods to set, retrieve and clear the dynamic values, along with the option of retrieving the sanitized values. below is a suggestion for the interface. $dispatch->set $name, $value ; $dispatch->get $name, $default ; $dispatch->getall ; $dispatch->getarray $name, $default = array ; $dispatch->getbool $name, $default = true ; $dispatch->getfloat $name, $default = 0.0 ; $dispatch->getinteger $name, $default = 0 ; $dispatch->getstring $name, $default = '' ; $dispatch->clear ; thank you for reading this proposal. please leave any comments or suggestions below.
