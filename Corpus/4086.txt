 URL : "https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Klooni1010/issues/29" TITLE : add new themes BODY : design and contribute your own theme for klooni! the only requirement is it has to be playable and not hurt players' eyes : to create a new theme, clone the repository, open themes/create-theme.html on a browser, and start designing. then, show me your result and if it's pleasing enough we can integrate it in the application. i'm a bit busy so i'll write more details if you need them.
