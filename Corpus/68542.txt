 URL : "https://github.com/EuroPython/epcon/issues/424" TITLE : saving stripe charge.id BODY : actually we don't save the stripe charge.id. this would at least in my mind simplify the refund process. this is where the charge is actually made: https://github.com/europython/epcon/blob/ep2017/assopy/stripe/views.py l85 'charge.id' is what we need to save in the db. basically i think we should add a new field here: https://github.com/europython/epcon/blob/ep2017/assopy/models.py l553 and put the value of charge.id inside of it
