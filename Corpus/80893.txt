 URL : "https://github.com/toddams/RazorLight/issues/123" TITLE : use page model in layout BODY : i know you discussed this in the issue https://github.com/toddams/razorlight/issues/4, but i would like to revisit it if you don't mind. i understand what you mean about a layout can be used by multiple views, which could have different model types, but i am hoping that you could still look at changing the code to follow exactly what mvc does today. currently mvc can do this, which is quite helpful for having a base class your models use, which can then be used directly in the layout by setting the model to the base class. mvc will throw an error if the view model can not be cast to the layout model. since this is the default behavior of mvc, i don't think it would be to much to ask that everyone using this to generate templates outside of mvc to follow the same guidelines. plus, there should be nothing stopping someone from doing what they do today. just have the layout inherit from templatepage, not templatepage<>, without specifying the model, and they should have access to viewbag. also, the model would be there but would return object instead. thoughts?
