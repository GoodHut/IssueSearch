 URL : "https://github.com/fuse-box/fuse-box/issues/513" TITLE : sourcemap files path BODY : when making bundles in subdirectories, the sourcemappingurl gets the path based on the dist root folder example: with fuse.bundle server/express ,the last line of dist/server/express.js is: // sourcemappingurl=server/express.js.map i am using the module source-map-loader as it seems nothing was planned natively in node nor fuse-box to use the sourcemap server-side, but therefore that relative path is problematic : the relative path to the map is express.js.map instead of server/express.js.map did i miss something about using the sourcemap on the server-side?
