 URL : "https://github.com/bzf/dotfiles/issues/20" TITLE : add ./bin/setup script BODY : formatting computers and installing all dependencies to get the dotfiles working is pretty annoying, so adding a script for fetching dependencies like rcm and installing tools like nvim , tmux etc would be nice. it will have to be host specific, maybe just uname will do but won't differentiate between linux distributions. maybe could use the _host_ tags in rcm for having platform dependent configurations, so this script maybe should generate the ~/.rcrc as well which can add the appropriate tags and stuff. something close to https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop would be nice.
