 URL : "https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/issues/9" TITLE : publish benchmarks app BODY : i'd love for the app the readme benchmarks are based on to be published, so that these can be analyzed and improved. personally, any time i see benchmarks i want to see: - how can i reproduce? - how many runs are the benchmarks based on? - was best run or average run considered? - what were the configurations? caching in the parcel config was mentioned, but what about caching capabilities of webpack, babel, etc...?
