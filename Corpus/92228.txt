 URL : "https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools/issues/547" TITLE : waiting for roots to load BODY : out of nowhere today, react devtools in electron no longer works. i have removed and reinstalled the devtools extension, confirmed the file is loaded via webpack, all the things i can think to check. i get this related error in my terminal the first time i try to open the react devtools tab in the chrome/electron developer tools : 60944:0217/193116:error:console 12406 uncaught typeerror: cannot read property 'get' of undefined , source: chrome-extension://react-developer-tools/build/panel.js 12406 strangest of all to me is that i am able to get the developer tools to show the properties of individual react elements if i select them with the element selector tool. the tree does not show though, and i don't think i am seeing the full properties of the objects i select when they do show. any help would be greatly appreciated, as i am dead in the water and out of ideas to try. thank you!
