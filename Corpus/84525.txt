 URL : "https://github.com/varnishcache/pkg-varnish-cache/issues/78" TITLE : debian stretch 9 support? BODY : i'm glancing around in the packagecloud.io repositories, but i'm not able to find any packages for debian 9 'stretch'; i'm trying to get some things updated to support debian 9, but right now it seems varnish is the main package that's unavailable through packagecloud it seems to only be available through system repos, is that correct?
