 URL : "https://github.com/denizyuret/Knet.jl/issues/243" TITLE : knetarray newbie question BODY : what's the difference between julia w = any 0.1f0 randn float32,10,784 , zeros float32,10,1 w = map knetarray, w and julia w = any knetarray 0.1f0 randn float32,10,784 , knetarray zeros float32,10,1 , of which the 2nd one throws error for a lot of built-in functions about type mis-match
