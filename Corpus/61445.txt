 URL : "https://github.com/dragotin/re/issues/9" TITLE : attributes for sections BODY : it would be good to have a way to define the sections in the config, and assign attributes to the section tempates to influence how re treats the sections. possible attributes so far: - persistent - copy the entries underneath this section to the new week - don't send : do not include this section in the mail when calling re -s both switches would be helpful for todo lists.
