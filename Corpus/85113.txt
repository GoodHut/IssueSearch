 URL : "https://github.com/moT01/pinterest/issues/1" TITLE : env variables not loading BODY : the dotenv setup is in the index of the server file. however for some reason, the authroutes file executes before the index file causing the env files not to load in the authroutes. i setup the env files in the authroutes too so i could use the env vars in the authroutes for now but ultimately, we should fix that.
