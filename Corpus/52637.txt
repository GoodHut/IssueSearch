 URL : "https://github.com/DaGenix/rust-crypto/issues/421" TITLE : continuing the project BODY : hello, this is not the best platform for this discussion but i had no idea how to contact you otherwise. i am a developer with an interest in cryptography and a relatively recent interest in rust. i'd like to contribute to this project; i need to sort out a couple of things before i can be 100% sure of this, but it's likely. in the meantime i forked the repo and i am going to play around with the code; mostly writing tests or more examples to get familiar with the codebase. what do you think?
