 URL : "https://github.com/shymonk/django-datatable/issues/65" TITLE : editable table entries? BODY : it doesn't look like there's support for editable tables, i was wondering if that was on the agenda. something like this - http://django-datatable-view.appspot.com/x-editable-columns/ i think i might want to work on that if that's at all possible, although i may need some guidance on where to start.
