 URL : "https://github.com/yDelouis/selfoss-android/issues/57" TITLE : check sub domain BODY : hey there, when i add my account, it doesn't matter if i use http s ://www.example.com/selfoss or http s ://example.com/selfoss, it will connect and get data only the first time. but if i later open the app, it does not sync because of the www. in domain-name. could you please throw an error during install or try both urls for updating? i know that there are no activities last months, this is just for people with the same problem. it may also be solavble in webserver-settings, but i have no access to it due to a webspace-only package exception is thrown from file c:\users\xxx\.gradle\caches\modules-2\files-2.1\org.springframework.android\spring-android-rest-template\1.0.1.release\a3f165f517617361739eeaf2e0e7dc1cf701cab8\spring-android-rest-template-1.0.1.release-sources.jar!\org\springframework\http\converter\json\mappingjackson2httpmessageconverter.java , line 126, so it may be a problem of the springframework
