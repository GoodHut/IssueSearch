 URL : "https://github.com/nourelhoda89/pojo/issues/1" TITLE : bad repo name BODY : @nourelhoda89 - what is your artifact? that should be the repo name. pojo is a general acronym. it doesn't describe anything but the fact it is a plain old java object. just delete this repository and create a new one with an appropriate name. if you have already done work locally that you haven't pushed, you can rename it but will need to do the following: git remote rm origin git remote add origin <new-path-for-renamed-repo> git pull origin master -- then you will have to commit the pull if you put anything in here eg readme . simply type : then wq followed by enter to exit vim with saving. git push --set-upstream origin master
