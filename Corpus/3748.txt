 URL : "https://github.com/TypeStrong/tsify/issues/227" TITLE : tsify is slow BODY : i'm wondering if i haven't made a glaring mistake, but tsify is taking around a minute and half to build our codebase's js whereas with just flow and babel it would take around 7 seconds. i've also noticed that if i get any typescript errors, i'll usually get around 6 repeated of the same error for the same line and column. are there any caveats i should be aware of, or is tsify just flow? ! capturfiles-aug-25-2017_09 28 51 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4743179/29723210-8f2e0e1c-8978-11e7-8a4a-daa044177877.png
