 URL : "https://github.com/zero-os/0-core/issues/390" TITLE : pub/sub for logs BODY : concept: we would like to improve the logging mechanism present in 0-core currently, any process that output a certain format is considered a log and is catch by 0-core to be put into a ledis queue. the improvement that we want to bring is to provide the possibility to subscribe to the log of a specific process see https://github.com/zero-os/0-core/issues/388 requirements: - possibility to subscribe to the log produce by any process/vm/container/... - the logs should not be lost if the subscriber is not yet listening to the publication when the log is emited with some limits, after a certain amount of logs we clean ledis to not explode memory - the subscriber need to be notify when a new log is available - this is done by 0-core that send a event to all subscriber with the location of the new log implementation idea: when a log entry is created by 0-core, logs is added to a hset and and notification is sent to all subscriber. some logic can be lua script in ledis that deal with cleaning log when memory limit is reach or if all subscriber have consumed the log
