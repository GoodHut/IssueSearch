 URL : "https://github.com/LSST-nonproject/sims_maf_contrib/issues/49" TITLE : tutorial histogram issues BODY : not sure if anyone else is getting these. i've been running a lot of the tutorials within these notebooks, and first brushed off this issue, but now am starting to question it. the introduction notebook does not actually plot anything for certain histograms, such as the one for airmass vs area. it is just a blank graph with a y-axis going from 0.000 to 0.001. my colleague and i noticed this when we were running the transientasciimetric tutorial from science/transients, as the graphs would have y-axes ranging from 0.000 to as high as 0.215 still showing nothing on the plot if we put the healpix nside down to 4, but keeping it at 16 as the tutorial has it makes the y-axis go only from 0.000 to 0.013. it only happens with histogram plots in which the y-axis is area 1000s of square degrees but i'm not sure why these plots aren't showing up as the notebooks suggest they should. is there something in the program for the metricbundle that filters down to these plots which i need to change? thanks for any help and i'm happy to explain more if needed. ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29585404/27455648-8da29ecc-578d-11e7-9b5a-6b04981f596d.png ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29585404/27455655-93248c34-578d-11e7-91a5-2739f0fe7cf7.png
