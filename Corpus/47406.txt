 URL : "https://github.com/sciter-sdk/go-sciter/issues/92" TITLE : passing window parent BODY : hello, would it be possible to tweak this function a bit: https://github.com/sciter-sdk/go-sciter/blob/master/window/window_windows.go l16-l29 so it could accept win.hwnd from github.com/lxn/win package as window parent or nil or 0 by default which could fallback to sciter.bad_hwindow and create window without parent? my use case here is: i'm using lxn/win to create tray icon, which uses its own window already hidden and not used, its only for main loop of tray atm. . i would like to use this window as a sciter parent, to be able as i understand to show sciter main window without taskbar icon. am i on good track here with my thinking process?
