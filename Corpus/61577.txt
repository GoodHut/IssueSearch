 URL : "https://github.com/kayex/sirius/issues/8" TITLE : batched message updates BODY : message updates should be batched, allowing quick extensions to get their edits across instantaneously while still allowing slower ones to finish. in order to put as little load on the rtm api as possible, we shouldn't do more than two updates per message invocation. the first update should happen after a short fixed time deadline perhaps 200ms . the second update should happen after 5 seconds have elapsed or all extensions have finished executing, whichever happens first.
