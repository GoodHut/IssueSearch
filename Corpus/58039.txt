 URL : "https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/issues/6958" TITLE : rfc: no wand, no magic BODY : right now, defining gettitle or settitle on a dataobject or viewabledata will hook into property override magic, affecting the behaviour of $obj->title . definition of methods that start with get/set is pretty common and i think that sometime people trip over the magic behaviour inadvertently, leading to unpredictable code. my recommendation we tie the magic behaviour of viewabledata to __get<name> and __set<name> , e.g. __gettitle and __settitle . in other words, put a wand before the name, from which the inspired humour of the issue title comes. should we retain the old behaviour? if we could get away with dropping it, that would be ideal. if we retain the old behaviour we will still have room for confusing bugs. potentially, we could introduce a configuration flag on viewabledata what would enable/disable the old behaviour, or throw a warning when the old behaviour was triggered. is it psr compliant? does putting __s in method names break psr-1? psr-1 http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/ overview says use camelcase without explaining more. it's clear that defining __get is mandatory for the phpcs linter for psr1/2 will allow any method that starts with __ as a magic method, so it will pass the linter. so... kind of? i think it's up to us to decide whether passing the linter is close enough.
