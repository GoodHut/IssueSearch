 URL : "https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-grid/issues/6464" TITLE : rowclass for grid options BODY : something that i feel should be present... we already have cellclass, which is quite useful, but if i want to do the same for the row, i either need to implement a row template which is overkill when you just want to conditionally apply a class , or put cellclass on each column - which add a lot of fluff to the code. not to mention that the default row template did not even work for me, so i was forced to use cellclass, as it took far less time rather than debugging the template.
