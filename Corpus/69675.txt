 URL : "https://github.com/IQ-Inc/foosball-scoreboard-demo/issues/1" TITLE : too much business in ui BODY : there's too much business logic and state in the ui. the current design allows multiple clients to subscribe to the same stream of foosball events and interpret the events individually. if clients want to watch the same game, it would be up to clients to sync themselves with each other and with the current game. a better design may be to have the game state held in the server, and the ui is a reflection of that state. we would need to handle who controls the new game button, so that spectators don't restart a currently running game.
