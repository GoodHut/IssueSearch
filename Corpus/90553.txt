 URL : "https://github.com/keathley/wallaby/issues/271" TITLE : small default window size BODY : the default phantomjs window size is 480 x 800, which isn't terribly useful for taking screenshots. i added a line in my featurecase to resize the window, but maybe it would be a good idea to increase the default size.
