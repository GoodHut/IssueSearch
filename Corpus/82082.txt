 URL : "https://github.com/dbs-leipzig/gradoop/issues/648" TITLE : add edge centric grouping BODY : the traditional grouping is vertex centric which means that the properties of vertices are considered where similar vertices form a group and will be represented by one super vertex. the edges of the normal vertices are then adjusted to the supervertices. in the edge centric grouping it is vice versa where similar edges will be grouped first. if, for example, there are two vertices with a lot of similar edges between each other two users which writes messages to each other , these edges could be represented by one super edge one conversation edge .
