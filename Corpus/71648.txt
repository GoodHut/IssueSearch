 URL : "https://github.com/pkulchenko/ZeroBraneStudio/issues/768" TITLE : add support for luacheck BODY : the reason i'd like to support luacheck is because it's more feature complete and can handle cases luainspect can't. i've added initial support for this in a fork https://github.com/capsadmin/zerobranestudio to enable this set staticanalyzer.luacheck in config to true or table to configure it. in this implementation i've made it use an environment based on the apis the current lua interpreter uses. ie corona and baselib . i would also like to add defined globals from other files but i'm not sure how to go about doing this. maybe something from the autocomplete api? see comments in inspect.lua for more concerns and questions.
