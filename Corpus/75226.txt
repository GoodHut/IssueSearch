 URL : "https://github.com/Jire/Charlatano/issues/137" TITLE : glow esp is not working. BODY : first of all i would like to thank for the update. now we get to the problem. since update 1.0 the opengl window doesn't appear in task bar and the glow doesn't work i don't know if the window has something to do with the esp no console errors . so i couldn't use it and stayed on 0.9.8. now the same problem for the latest release. another question: is it fine if i moved the new offsets to version 0.9.8 and continued using it? thanks.
