BODY : currently enabling vsync locks the fps 60, which it great for games that run at such speeds, but with games that run at 30fps then run at twice the speed intended, making in almost unplayable like turok . i propose that an option to lock games to 30fps or 60fps would be a much better solution. even if it locks to you vsync of your monitor as vsync is supposed to 30fps doesn't work on modern screens and actually requires a crt meaning setting a virtual refresh rate won't work as well
