 URL : "https://github.com/lipis/github-stats/issues/6" TITLE : change heading color BODY : the current heading color, 317eac , is a light blue which is quite similar to the link color, 2fa4e7 , and especially to the link hover color, 157ab5 . this makes it easy to confuse them: ! screenshot from 2017-12-01 13-28-11 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/478237/33484770-a14ab616-d69b-11e7-9ad7-b00be35c9a50.png i would suggest either using a slightly off-blue color e.g. a greenish blue like seagreen to make the distinction clearer, of even going the extra mile and using a complementary color fropm the orange-ish side. in this case i'd suggest in increasing order of saturation : peru , chocolate , or darkorange . i would propose a pr myself but i wasn't able to figure out which file to edit.
