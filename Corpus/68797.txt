 URL : "https://github.com/rmzelle/ref-extractor/issues/13" TITLE : show selected csl style BODY : i'm not sure how mendeley stores this information, but zotero apparently stores it in docprops/custom.xml see https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/comment/268566 comment_268566 . zotero users currently don't have an easy way to identify the style used to render references in word documents, if the style in question isn't installed. dependent on 8 need generic unzip and xml parsing .
