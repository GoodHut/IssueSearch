 URL : "https://github.com/CoinCapDev/CoinCap.io/issues/87" TITLE : price is incorrect. BODY : as of a few minutes ago: http://coincap.io/page/xrp is returning price :2.50953 the price on the front of the site is 2.0. that api page is simply returning mktcap / supply and not the volume weighted average of all prices reported at each market. please resolve this as it's fairly annoying. i'm currently having to use this api alongside binance's simply because i can't get an accurate price reading. same issue with every currency, btc currently reads $13210 on the front page but the api returns $13542 as i write this.
