BODY : i think it would be helpful if there was a more librarian/archivist description of why it is useful to know how to navigate the shell. i think the current description is good but, speaking as someone who does not do a lot of their own programming, the current description doesn't really speak to why it is important for someone like me to know the shell. instead of the motivations for wanting to learn shell commands are many and various. , perhaps something like, even if you do not do your own programming or your work currently does not involve the command line, knowing some basics about the shell can be useful. for example, you may find yourself working with a scholar who primarily works through the shell or you may discover down the road that it is the best way to interact with a repository or archive.
