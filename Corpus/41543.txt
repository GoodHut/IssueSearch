 URL : "https://github.com/yahoo/memcached-binary/issues/2" TITLE : access removed by bot BODY : @gyehuda , looks like my access to this repository was automatically removed by some process. was i incorrectly removed, or is this going to be a recurring problem? it looks like i still own the npm entry, and i've prepared a new repo at https://github.com/jimbly/memcached-binary , if you think it would be easier to just migrate it out of the yahoo org, i can just send a pull request that changes the readme to indicate where people should send new pull requests.
