 URL : "https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/521" TITLE : docs link is broken BODY : hi, i don't know if this is the right place to notify someone that the links on https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html that points to http://jacquev6.net/pygithub/v1 are dead. both links are in the what's next? section. perhaps they should point to https://pygithub.github.io/pygithub/v1/reference.html instead? if this isn't the right place, could you please let me know whom i should advise?
