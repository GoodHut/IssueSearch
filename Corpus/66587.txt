 URL : "https://github.com/NLeSC/research-software-directory-frontend/issues/2" TITLE : name of this repository BODY : there are two repositories within the nlesc github organisation called 'rsd....' and one called 'research-software-directory....'. it would be easier if naming could be kept consistent, even if it is 'just' for internal communication. so, if you could rename this repository that would be good.
