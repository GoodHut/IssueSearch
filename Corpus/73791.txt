 URL : "https://github.com/wbsoft/frescobaldi/issues/1045" TITLE : dependency download link BODY : the download link on the frescobaldi download page for pyqt5 points to the page for pyqt4. sure there are links on that page to download pyqt5, but it would be far less confusing to people if it pointed directly to the pyqt5 page, especially since many users are having problems with dependencies on ubuntu 16 and above, and this matter just adds one more piece of confusion to the puzzle. simple to fix!
