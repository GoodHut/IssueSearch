 URL : "https://github.com/BuiltBrokenModding/site/issues/28" TITLE : fix grammer and spelling BODY : anyone can do this but it needs to be done sooner than later. we need to go over every section and adjust it to sound good. pass it through www.grammarly.com if needed to check if everything works. the goal is to make the site look professional. right now there are issues with some words being capitalized in the middle of the sentence. as well try to keep everything as short as possible. we just need a hook to bait people into clicking the button to learn more about each item.
