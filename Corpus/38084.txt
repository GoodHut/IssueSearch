 URL : "https://github.com/gio1135/chromedeveditor/issues/1" TITLE : node and npm support BODY : this isn't an issue as much as it's a question and didn't know where else to put this. how hard would it be to add gitpush support? it already has git clone. and i've been wanting to port over some apps that use node. and i'm wondering how hard it would be to add npm support so i don't have to put my chromebook in dev mode.
