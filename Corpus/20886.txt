 URL : "https://github.com/jbgraug/postbuild/issues/6" TITLE : define output root BODY : hi, i'm testing postbuild with npm scripts to inject js and css bundles into a base html template. the problem is that the injected urls are not relative to root, so they only work 1 place in the url hierarchy of our site. adding / to the path results in build failure, and i cannot get the -g option to do any good. there should be an option, as @xtreemrage suggests in an earlier issue, to define root or prefix to the output url. otherwise it works great, thanks!
