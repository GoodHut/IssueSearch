BODY : https://github.com/greenroses/readable/blob/7aee751e6dac1861dd324ee9b59525fdb355315a/src/reducers/index.js l73 the bug is that you don't return the object but whatever javascript return when asigning a value to a property which i think is the value at the right of the '=' to better understand it; javascript let foo = {} console.log foo oneattribute = some value // prints 'some value' as that is what the //assignation operation returns . this allows to daisy chain and assign one value to multiple properties: // let a = b = 5; will assign 5 to a and b as b = 5 returns 5 console.log foo // prints { 'oneattribute' : 'some value'} so in your case you must do the return only after the assignation.
