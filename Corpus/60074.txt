 URL : "https://github.com/kernelsauce/turbo/issues/328" TITLE : websocket url matching BODY : the websockethandler's :open does not seem to support url matching, like the web.requesthandler does. i'm writing an application that generates a token on an login page and also uses websockets to communicate with the server. at the moment i need to send the token to the server via websockets to authenticate the newly opened websocket, as i don't want to send my token with every request. supporting a syntax like the web.requesthandler would allow me to add the websocket to the trusted list of websockets on open.
