 URL : "https://github.com/Luracast/Restler/issues/569" TITLE : would like a uuid type BODY : it's pretty common to use a uuid type as the 'key' for url components. what do you think about providing a {@type uuid} modifier, or even easier just having '@param uuid $uid' for the type. right now all my uid params have to put {@min 36} {@max 36} on them. i'm thinking that could be built in, as well as maybe even doing a regex match to make sure it's in the right format.
