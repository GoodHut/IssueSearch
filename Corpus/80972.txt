 URL : "https://github.com/developmentseed/landsat-util/issues/234" TITLE : usgs soap api deprecated BODY : from the usgs python client docs http://kapadia.github.io/usgs/ : > as of may 15, 2017 the usgs has deprecated their soap api. this library has been updated to use their json api. as a result most, if not all, responses through this client will have a different structure compared to the older soap version. this is most probably the reason why the error message could not be parsed in 233 needs to be fixed in the usgs_eros https://github.com/developmentseed/landsat-util/blob/362d5b046f8c33112652b0a167e96332e9da4630/landsat/downloader.py l96 function - but not the reason for the error.
