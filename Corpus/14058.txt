 URL : "https://github.com/Keypr/helium/issues/11" TITLE : add afterall hook BODY : we have a way to define some common, unrepeatable actions before a group of specs. we need just place the code inside description - it would be run before nested context. unfortunately, we cannot do something similar as a result action after all nested specs - it would be anyway performed before nested specs. let's see an example. consider, i need only one affiliate for some group of specs - all next action would be about reservations and they do not require re-creation of the affiliate. but if i want to clean up my db modifications after all, there is no way except to create affiliate before each spec and delete it after each spec. with afterall hook i could escape redundant calls and improve reliability: groovy describe 'test' spec { createaffapi describe 'add reservation' spec { //... } describe 'modify reservation' spec { //... } afterall { deleteaffapi } } i would even recommend introducing 'beforeall' hook for consistency and restrict performing any code without wrapping in hooks or specs.
