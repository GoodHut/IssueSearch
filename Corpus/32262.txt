 URL : "https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/issues/1309" TITLE : unlimited core mode BODY : hey @nico, i am looking to add a new mode, possibly a value passed to -j or reading an environment variable to decide to enable this special or not that runs as many parallel tasks as possible. the easy way would be to just pass -j 1000 or something silly but i would like to actually get the number of concurrent tasks possible, which depends on the project, it could be limited by one part of a build depending on something previous being built and linked by the same project looking through the code wanted_edges_ and command_edges_ pop out in src/build.cc could i get your input on how i would achieve this mode? i assume this is not possible because ninja just does what the it is told by the script but is there a way to differentiate between compile and link jobs for this also. best, martell
