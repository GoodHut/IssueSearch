 URL : "https://github.com/maison-notman-house/notman-entrance-dashboard/issues/59" TITLE : allow for video overlay BODY : look at providing a solution for displaying a full screen video once in a while, which when finished playing automatically disappears. avoid using youtube for this. this because based on previous experience the video will tend to show play controls or fail to loop properly. it would be simpler just to have an mp4. support both landscape and portrait, recognising it won't be the same video. maybe use sheets as a form of playlist.
