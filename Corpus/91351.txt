 URL : "https://github.com/Megabyte918/MultiOgar-Edited/issues/405" TITLE : this is for @megabyte918! BODY : @megabyte918 i am looking into a solution on making my server great. you made a comment on the multiogar page ages ago: https://github.com/barbosik/multiogar/issues/333 when you made 4 solutions on how to make it better, well first off, you forked this off the original multiogar. on the 3rd solution change number from 2, to 2.5 , i can't find this line in my gameserver.js: var splitmass = curmass / 2; how do you change the value from 2, to 2.5? because i can't find this? i tested all of this on the original multiogar, and the popsplits are amazing for me but i want to have the same physics on the multiogar-edited. hope you can help! i want to know, and if it works, i'll be extremely happy.
