 URL : "https://github.com/spacejack/mithril.d.ts/issues/6" TITLE : add this to types repo BODY : hello, i see in this issue https://github.com/lhorie/mithril.js/issues/1402 that you suggested adding this directly to mithril.js, too bad that didn't happen : but i see you suggested adding it to dt, but i'd like to suggest instead of that, or maybe in addition to that, you add it to types https://github.com/types so typings can be used for managing.
