 URL : "https://github.com/LMFDB/lmfdb/issues/2202" TITLE : hmf redundant url's BODY : hello, in the hilbert modular forms url's there is some redundancy, as one uses the long label that also contains the field label, e.g.: http://beta.lmfdb.org/modularform/gl2/totallyreal/3.3.469.1/holomorphic/3.3.469.1-266.2-a however, for bianchi modular forms we avoid this redundancy, e.g.: http://beta.lmfdb.org/modularform/gl2/imaginaryquadratic/2.0.8.1/100.1/a/ is there a reason for this inconsistency? should we fix it? if so, perhaps we should use: http://beta.lmfdb.org/modularform/gl2/totallyreal/3.3.469.1/holomorphic/266.2/a thank you, edgar
