 URL : "https://github.com/IcecrownServer/Icecrown/issues/54" TITLE : tower of althalaxx BODY : bug: magthrull's pet succubus is doing an unrealistic 200 damage per hit even in bear form while being a quest around level 22 this is seriously wrong. magthrull's shadowbolts deal 100 damage alone, but that pet should not be doing 200 per hit how to reproduce: fight the mob at a level ~20-22 how it should work; a succubus of that level should be doing damage around 40-60. source: other npc's around the npc, other demons, felguards and felhounds, etc.
