 URL : "https://github.com/ad-m/python-anticaptcha/issues/3" TITLE : managing a proxy server BODY : google accepts ip address mismatch. however, in the future this can be changed. anticaptcha supports the connection of workers via a proxy. the library could be responsible for launching a local proxy server for this purpose. when needed, this will be implemented. please signal if i missed the change.
