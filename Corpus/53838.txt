 URL : "https://github.com/pinqy520/mobx-persist/issues/6" TITLE : example for list array BODY : i am unable to get the serialization/de-serialization to work with list in react-native asyncstorage, can someone provide example how to do this? i was able to make it work with objects, maps and primitives but never with list array . i declare list inside a class @persist 'list' @observable @serializable numlist = 1,2,3,4 and an action to get it @action getnumlist {console.log this.numlist } but the result from the console.log is always empty object. also if i do an empty list and than call the setter action to push values inside the array nothing happens and i have again empty object.
