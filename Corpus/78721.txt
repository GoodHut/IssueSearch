 URL : "https://github.com/keybase/client/issues/9092" TITLE : red line in keybase chat BODY : this may seem like a small thing, but in keybase chat, a red line is shown to indicate where new messages begin in a given chat. the problem is that when the window gains focus, this line does not reliably get removed after a short delay, and there appears to be no way to remove that line without either switching chats and coming back, or sending a reply. it would be nice to have an option to disable the red line altogether, if possible.
