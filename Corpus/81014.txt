 URL : "https://github.com/dj-nitehawk/Pandorian/issues/30" TITLE : v2.9.6 first impressions BODY : install over previous version went well. however, i am still getting the following error - or rather warning message from windows defender smartscreen filter https://www.howtogeek.com/123938/htg-explains-how-the-smartscreen-filter-works-in-windows-8/ : > windows defender smartscreen prevented an unrecoginzed app from starting. running this app might put your pc at risk. more info clicking more info allows you to proceed with no further complaints. i fully understand pandorian is safe but some new users trying this out may be put off by the message and hesitant or even unwilling to proceed. i don't know what it takes to get put on microsoft's whitelist i would hope and expect no money but i feel that should be looked into. the window position being remembered across restarts works perfectly - glad to see that addressed! : i like pandorian to sit in the lower left corner of my no 2 right side monitor and it is nice i don't have to pull it from the center every morning. :+1: not sure what the problem was previously with multimonitor positioning support. perhaps it was tied to the position remembering issue above but i have been using pandorian on my no. 2 monitor since day one with no problems. i start pandorian from a shortcut icon i keep on no. 2 monitor and every time, it has started on no. 2 monitor as expected. now it still starts correctly on monitor no. 2 but is already positioned in the lower left corner, right where i last left it! sweet! : pandorian just keeps getting better and better! : :+1: :+1:
