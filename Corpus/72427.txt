 URL : "https://github.com/HoraApps/LeafPic/issues/439" TITLE : build error - dimensions BODY : dunno if it's just me or if it's a common error. anyway, just wanted to check out the current state of development. i checked out the dev branch. a simple gradlew build wasn't successfull. thus i tried it using android studio. immediately i found out you're working with the 3.0 builds of android studio. well, i downloaded it instantly and replaced my 2.3 version. however, even having this setup i get build errors telling me there are errors with the dimensions. is this an error on my end or is it common? thanks for your help in advance!
