 URL : "https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/issues/3502" TITLE : build arm packages BODY : i'd really love to be able to easily use the datadog-agent on some raspberry pi's. there's a guide in https://help.datadoghq.com/hc/en-us/articles/208163513-deploying-the-agent-on-raspberrypi with information on building the datadog-agent from source, which works, but is incredibly slow compared to an apt-get install datadog-agent on an amd64. are there any plans to build arm packages? any plans to re-build the datadog-agent with go for 6.x? :
