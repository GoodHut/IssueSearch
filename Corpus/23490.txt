 URL : "https://github.com/mikeal/bent/issues/5" TITLE : post body is empty BODY : i'm trying to send some json via post like this: javascript const bent = require 'bent' ; const postjson = bent 'post', 'json' ; const token = 'xxx'; const user = await postjson 'http://localhost:3000/endpoint', { token } ; i'm running a restify-server that is hosting the endpoint - including the bodyparser-plugin: javascript const restify = require 'restify' ; const server = restify.createserver ; server.use restify.plugins.bodyparser { mapparams: true } ; server.post '/endpoint', req, res, next => { console.log 'endpoint', req.body ; res.send {a: 'ok!'} ; } ; server.listen 3000, => { console.log '%s listening at %s', server.name, server.url ; } ; but req.body is undefined . tried the same with a small expressjs setup - results were the same. saw in the test, that you're doing something similar with put : https://github.com/mikeal/bent/blob/e018c13f096b610ab0ac82d462456534f90e7e93/tests/test-basics.js l141-l142 this seems to work. any ideas why it isn't working with restify/express?
