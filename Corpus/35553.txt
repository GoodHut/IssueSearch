 URL : "https://github.com/RyanBayne/WordPressBugNet/issues/1" TITLE : error identity class BODY : this must happen very early in bugnets development. i need to consider a template approach to collecting system errors and attaching custom responses to them. this includes hard-coded notices i.e. like a range of api responses and we'll have messages prepared for generating friendly user- notices. it will also include the storing environment errors. when an error is encouraged it will be compared to those already stored. if it is a duplicate then it will not be stored again. this could be complex where errors include line numbers or filenames so what we would do is discard any notices that sit for too long without a custom notice being linked to it. administrators will be able to apply custom reactions to specific errors. - send an email and who to send emails to. start with a pool of pre-selected admin accounts - notice message for basic users and more detailed ones for administrators. - ability to encourage a report form to be complete. user reports class - environment snapshots at different levels. admin decide how much information is stored - report notice to wordpressbugnet or not. use bugnet api to compare errors to other sites
