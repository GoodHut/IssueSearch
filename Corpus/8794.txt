 URL : "https://github.com/ServUO/ServUO/issues/2259" TITLE : runic atlas bug BODY : the runic atlas is like an enhanced runebook. the problem is you can not have two rune books open at one time so i would be willing to bet that you should not be able to have a runic atlas and a runebook open at the same time. reported by: tasanar report thread: http://servuo.com/threads/runic-atlas-bug.7562/
