BODY : hi, first of all, thanks for the great work put in this randomizer, i have lots of fun watching races and playing it. in your 2.5 version changelog, you wrote wall jumping up to early gauntlet without hi-jump will no longer be enforced for completion. note that going there early if you can is still going to be a good choice most of the time . is that still true? because if it is i got a seed that did not enforce this tx5756082 . i went everywhere i could without speed or high jump, except gauntlet i did not know how to get to it before this : - crateria minus gauntlet - all of brinstar but waterway - all upper norfair - only 2 items in wrecked ship : right super+gravity. not the etank since i didn't have high jump or speed to go through the first room with water before spiky death room . so the only place i could theoretically go to was gauntlet. and i did, after half an hour of learning the not so easy walljumps to get there. and there was high jump, that unlocked litterally everything : - lower norfair lava dive - ws etank where gravity was - suitless outer maridia which i did, since i forgot about ws etank : so, long story short, is that a bug or did you change that logic at some point?
