 URL : "https://github.com/GLab/ToMaTo/issues/1468" TITLE : create an editor.js BODY : it's nice for development to have the editor split into many files, but it has the drawback that it takes the broser .5 seconds to load this. instead, we should create a single js out of the splitted editor plus dependencies to speed things up. this is created by the django server on startup and cached.
