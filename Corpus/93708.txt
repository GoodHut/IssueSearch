 URL : "https://github.com/text-mask/text-mask/issues/649" TITLE : angular2: dynamic textmask BODY : i have a form which i create dynamically with specific control types. so a phone type will create a textbox with necessary validation for phone numbers and a phone text mask. while a date of birth type will create everything necessary for dob. there may also be types which don't require a mask such as name. the challenge comes with dynamically creating the textmask. it is possible to create the mask portion dynamically, but i haven't found a way to create the whole thing mask, guide, keepcharpositions, pipe, etc dynamically. as well as have the option to not have any textmask at all. something like this would be nice: html html <input textmask = mask type= text /> component javascript get mask { switch controltype { case 'phone': { return {mask: ' ', / 1-9 /, /\d/, /\d/, ' ', ' ', /\d/, /\d/, /\d/, '-', /\d/, /\d/, /\d/, /\d/ }; break; } case 'dob': { const autocorrecteddatepipe = createautocorrecteddatepipe 'mm/dd/yyyy' ; return {mask: /\d/, /\d/, '/', /\d/, /\d/, '/', /\d/, /\d/, /\d/, /\d/ , keepcharpositions: true, pipe: autocorrecteddatepipe }; break; } default: { return null; // this causes errors within text-mask and so does returning {} break; } } } anyone know a way to do this currently?
