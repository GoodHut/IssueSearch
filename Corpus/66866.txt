 URL : "https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/issues/736" TITLE : nonce gets out of order BODY : i do sometimes issue requests simultaneously and rely on the rate limiter to serialize them. let's say i use ava testing framework and my testfile looks something like this: for / list of exchanges / { const exchange = new ccxt exchangeid keys exchangeid ; test ${exchange.id}: insufficientfunds , testinsufficientfunds, exchange, symbol, amount, price ; test ${exchange.id}: invalidorder , testinvalidorder, exchange, 1 ; } ava runs its test s concurrently and quite seldom but still i get something like: > invalid nonce parameter, you sent: 1512312887, you should send: 1512312889 obviously, requests get mixed somewhere between signature and actual fetch. and the only place i can think of where they can be mixed is inside executerestrequest . it doesn't put fetch es in sequence explicitly so might it happen that node mixes them?
