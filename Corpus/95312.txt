 URL : "https://github.com/DarkFlamex1/RoomPlugin/issues/9" TITLE : create unity example scene BODY : while trying to write tests, i've found that it's hard to get an idea of what the behaviour should be so it ends up being hard to actually write the tests. i think having a scene in unity that has a button for each api function would be good. i'll do this to help me out with the tests, and probably put it in a separate repo.
