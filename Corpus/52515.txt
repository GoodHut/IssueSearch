 URL : "https://github.com/nbnuk/nbnatlas-issues/issues/222" TITLE : common name conflation BODY : searching for soprano pipistrelle mostly returns information about moth with that name: https://species.nbnatlas.org/search?q=&fq=commonname:%22soprano%20pipistrelle%22 however, the 'alt-names' box has information relating to a bat with the same common name: soprano pipistrelle, 55 khz pipistrelle, 55 khz pipistrelle, brown pipistrelle, white oak midget seems like the moth and bat records are being conflated in some way on this page?
