 URL : "https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/issues/253" TITLE : swift 4 protection level BODY : hi, when i include the latest pod into my xcode project, at compile time i get several issues as a result of swift 4.0. private variables/properties cannot be used in class extensions unless they're marked as internal instead of private. i've since downloaded the swift 4.0 grdb branch and embedded it into my xcode project as a framework, made the private/internal protection level issues and it resolves the issue s . i would however prefer to have this done via your accepted code or update pod. unless there's something i'm not doing right with the swift 4 grdb branch now known as grdb 2.0.1 . can you please advise?
