 URL : "https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate/issues/1726" TITLE : npm run build fails BODY : react boilerplate facing a very weird issue...basically i have some react code needs to be loaded as a node module . it is not compiled from react/es6 javascript. so i have configured internals/webpack/webpack.base.babel.js file in modules section like following. js { test: /\.js$/, loader: 'babel-loader', include: /arc-grid/, query: options.babelquery, } with this change, i was able to load & run application successfully with npm start . but when i run npm run build getting following error. ! image https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1515160/25343146/cb5b661c-292b-11e7-8aba-fe3ee70d2aa0.png not sure if i need to add same config some where else...can any one point where i got it wrong? as far as i know, even internals/webpack/webpack.prod.babel.js is loading config from internals/webpack/webpack.base.babel.js only. but somehow it is not understanding about my new loader sorry to spam. glitter group didn't provide any answers. had to create it as an issue here. versions - react-boilerplate see package.json : 3.4.0 - node/npm: 6.10 - browser: chrome
