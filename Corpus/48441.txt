 URL : "https://github.com/hps/heartland-magento-extension/issues/109" TITLE : save token is session BODY : i can't think of any great reason why the token shouldn't be saved in the user's checkout session data instead of just on the user's page. currently if the user goes back to any of the previous checkout steps their payment data is lost and they have to re-enter it again. i propose that the token, cc type, cc expiration, cc last 4 and length of cvv be saved in the checkout session so when the payment step is loaded if a token is already present a new one will not be required. to support this for the iframe method when loading the payment step with session data present rather than try to populate the fields with masked data the form could just be hidden and a link could be displayed that when clicked would display the form and if it is not clicked then the existing token is used. ! screenshot https://content.screencast.com/users/colinmollenhour/folders/jing/media/6d2bb121-9089-42e6-b9f0-5ab508bd9a42/2017-05-22_1236.png
