 URL : "https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/issues/1762" TITLE : fix transliteration import BODY : where ever getslug is implemented, in browser and server we should be able to use slugify from transliteration https://github.com/andyhu/transliteration as an import: import { transliterate as tr, slugify } from transliteration ; this works server side, but the functions do not work client side. as a temporary solution to this, we included /client/lib/transliteration.min.js . the goal of this issue is to remove the min.js, and get the imports to work. as is, the import works, but the tr, slugify functions do not. as a quick attempt to test this again did not work, this might need some src debugging.
