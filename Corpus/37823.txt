 URL : "https://github.com/aurora-pro/apex-sigma/issues/580" TITLE : music abruptly stops BODY : cause: the current data stream is a direct stream connection to youtube via ytdl. this can get interrupted due to unknown reasons, just regular network hiccups, and will mark the stream as finished, cycling to the next song. fix: make ytdl first download the song in it's entirety and play that via ffmpeg player instead of ytdl.
