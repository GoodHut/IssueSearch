 URL : "https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/fluent-plugin-google-cloud/issues/124" TITLE : format json doesn't work BODY : my application generates a log file which is formatted as per fluentd json format config one json object per line this works when i set format to none but entire json is sent in textpayload . when i set format as json , the logs are not even forwarded to google stackdriver logging at least i can't see them in the ui . <source> @type tail format json path /var/log/my-app/json-formatted.log pos_file /var/lib/google-fluentd/pos/my-app-json-formatted-log.pos read_from_head true tag xxxxx </source> there is no error/warning in /var/log/google-fluentd/google-fluentd.log . i could find similar question asked on stackoverflow here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41034377/format-json-not-working-in-google-fluend but the suggested solution also didn't work for me.
