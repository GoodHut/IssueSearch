 URL : "https://github.com/just-boris/create-preact-app/issues/5" TITLE : css class as object BODY : hey. i've had trouble using an object as a class in jsx with this package. according to the preact docs and the repl on preactjs.com what's supposed to happen is that the object keys with truthy values get used as classes. instead, i just end up with a class of object object . suggestions?
