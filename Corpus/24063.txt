 URL : "https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/issues/113" TITLE : schema id proposal BODY : hi all! our schema must be able to identify different features. we need to agree on the way to identify these. we have a few constraints: we would like not to rely on the file structure we choose, as it is unclear how it will be in the future 1 large file, numerous small files, or even in a db . for the moment, the experiments showed 2 kind of file structures that we are using: - 1 file for a large set of features like webextensions . we privileges here the simplicity to do batch changes. - 1 file for each interface for apis, or for each property for css. we privileges here the simplicity to do individual changes. we don't know which of these file structures will be the best in the long term, so we need to have a identifier that works in both cases without to much added complexity . the proposal is the following: we put the id inside the json: e.g. css.properties.line-height would be the id for the line-height properties and written: { css : { properties : { line-height : {...} } e.g { webgl2renderingcontext : { api : { webgl2renderingcontext : {...}, webgl2renderingcontext.beginquery : {...}, ... } } to indicate the bottom of the id, the idea would be to use a special keyword __compat or similar to indicates that what follows is the compat information. what do you think of this idea?
