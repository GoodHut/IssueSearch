 URL : "https://github.com/ilich/MvcReportViewer/issues/194" TITLE : causing site to hang.... BODY : i'm connecting to a remote ssrs server and running a report and returning it. when my view is calling @html.mvcreportviewer my site becomes unresponsive for a bit no requests will work . i ran a performance profiler on it to check for concurrency and it reported a blocking issue on system.web.ui.page.process called by asp.mvcreportviewer_mvcreportviewer_aspx.processrequest. i'm at a loss for what it could causing these issues. i've tried release version as well as debug without any affect. has anyone else had this issue?
