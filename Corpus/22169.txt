 URL : "https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens/issues/833" TITLE : indenting on wrap? BODY : sp-unwrap-sexp re-indents the contents of the unwrapped pair. sp-wrap-with-pair with a region will reindent the region wrapped. however, manually wrapping selecting a region and typing { doesn't reindent the region. indenting is a bit out of smartparens domain, but auto-indents support for pairs doesn't work or i don't get how it's supposed to and aggressive-indent doesn't work particularly well for me. so how about and option that'll make smartparens reindent wrapped region? or is there an easy way to add a post-handler to all pairs?
