 URL : "https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-sdk-py/issues/187" TITLE : retina with static api? BODY : hello, it seems i can't choose the retina format for my static generated maps. if i look in the code: if auto: pth = '/{mapid}/geojson {overlay} /auto/{width}x{height}.{fmt}' but if i look at the global documentation, the url scheme is {width}x{height}@2x.{fmt} so the is not the possibility to add retina images here?
