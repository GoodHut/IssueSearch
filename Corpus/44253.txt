 URL : "https://github.com/skypjack/entt/issues/6" TITLE : error in code example BODY : hi! i wanted to bring your attention to a potential issue in the code example in the readme. i am trying out entt and noticed i was getting a compilation error on the following loop: for auto entity: ecs.view<position> .exclude<velocity> { std::cout << registry.has<position> entity << / << registry.has<velocity> entity << std::endl; } specifically, 'registry': undeclared indentifier. switching registry to ecs seems to make the example work as expected: for auto entity : ecs.view<position> .exclude<velocity> { std::cout << ecs.has<position> entity << / << ecs.has<velocity> entity << std::endl; } i only dabble in c++ so i didn't want to submit a pr for this fix in case i am missing something obvious.
