 URL : "https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs/issues/1715" TITLE : network load order BODY : why does systemjs always load the requested dependency on import first and then its dependencies? with scriptload: true this fails, plus this is a deviation from how requirejs works and i don't see the use. after name resolution, why can't systemjs look at the meta , check deps and follow the tree right down to the leaves and then load in reverse order? before you ask, i'm using scriptload: true here because i am trying to get around a server that does not have cors enabled and that i do not control.
