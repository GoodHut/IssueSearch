 URL : "https://github.com/prestodb/presto/issues/8094" TITLE : add uuid type BODY : there are very many use cases i've hit where a uuid is a column in the data -- some data provides split it into two longs like adobe , many send it in base 16 as a string, some upper case some lower case, some with hyphens, some without. then there's this cool variant by adobe: 128-bit number that consists of 2 signed, positive, 64-bit numbers in base 10, both padded to 19 zeros, and then concatenated . sitecatalyst https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_us/sc/clickstream/analytics_clickstream.pdf the code for decimal is very similar for what a uuid might look like. it's just two 64 bit longs.
