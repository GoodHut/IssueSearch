 URL : "https://github.com/GMDevinity/Flood/issues/231" TITLE : idea - ticket submission BODY : i'd like to propose the idea of a ticket/mail system overview ___________ a place on the forums where staff members mod rank or lower and players can submit their problems anonymously. these messages would only be accessible by admin+. ___________ q: why? a: an idea like this can serve multiple purposes like a github for everybody . i mainly intend it to be used as a box where players and staff members alike can tell their problems. admin+ can then assign other staff members ie: bug related = donk/bay, drama related = me/countercraftz
