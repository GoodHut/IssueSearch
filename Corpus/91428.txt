 URL : "https://github.com/yishn/Sabaki/issues/314" TITLE : toggle color in edit mode BODY : when in edit mode, and with select tool set to stone tool, as far as i can tell you have to click on the stones at the bottom to change colour. it would be very convenient if the same hotkey cmd+1 in macos, i'm assuming ctrl+1 on other oss could also toggle the colour.
