 URL : "https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/issues/1247" TITLE : error accessing accounts BODY : versions node: v9.3.0 npm: 5.6.0 web3@1.0.0-beta.27 problem i'm following the voting dapp tutorial https://medium.com/@mvmurthy/full-stack-hello-world-voting-ethereum-dapp-tutorial-part-1-40d2d0d807c2 which is pre web3v1.0. i'm unable to get any accounts from web3. i have testrpc running on a separate terminal. in the current terminal, i opened node and created the web3 and web3 variables correctly. when i run web3.eth.accounts 0 , i get back undefined . yes i can see the 10 testrpc accounts when i run web3.eth.getaccounts .then console.log but i would like to have the account set automatically. this also seems to affect any contract i create as mycontract.options.address always returns null . any idea what's wrong?
