 URL : "https://github.com/andymikulski/nES6/issues/19" TITLE : render target option BODY : currently, nes6 creates a canvas element and drops it on the page. there should be an option to target a specific dom element to render to. questions should the option be to render to a container element, or should the dev provide the actual canvas that nes6 should attempt to render to? should we provide options for both?
