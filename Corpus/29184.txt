BODY : i have been trying to run a hybrid assembly with long minion and short illumina reads, but i am getting an error that java is too old, although i just used brew brew cask install java to install the latest version today 9.0.1 . thanks in advance, and i can't wait to see what this can do for our genome after a stellar assembly with just long reads that only took an hour or so!
