 URL : "https://github.com/brailleapps/braille-utils.pef-tools/issues/2" TITLE : table detection algorithm BODY : the table detection algorithm is flawed in that it includes 8 dot patterns when it shouldn't. perhaps this line is incorrect: https://github.com/brailleapps/braille-utils.pef-tools/blob/releases/v2.0.0/src/org/daisy/braille/pef/textinputdetector.java l138 in addition, the encoding is unknown causing some 6 dot tables to produce a thumbprint with more than 64 characters.
