 URL : "https://github.com/elytra/FruitPhone/issues/13" TITLE : new crash and suggestion BODY : - v1.7 - mc 1.7.10 - forge 1614 crashlog: http://pastebin.com/nau4kwhr while just going around and looking at things i got this crash when i made it to a generator i had, im thinking it happened with the iron pipe from magneticraft. also, my suggestion is possibly the configuration option of the removal of the inventory slots when looking at things. but i think thats the one probe's option, but that'd remove the bars, which i do want.
