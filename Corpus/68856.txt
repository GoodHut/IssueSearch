 URL : "https://github.com/xhqiao89/hydroserverlite_test/issues/80" TITLE : site details page issue BODY : <b>1019fowler codeplex </b> <br />the site details page is not working for any of the sites. to view this issue simply select a site and click on the link quotclick here for site details and data.quot it will bring you to the details page for that site. it seems like the ajax isn't loading because there is extraneous information in displayed on the right side of the screen and at the bottom left corner of the page. the table tab no longer works nor does the graphing option. i have marked this issue as a quothighquot impact issue because not being able to view the site details and information defeats one of the purposes to the worldwater site.
