 URL : "https://github.com/raptorjit/raptorjit/issues/97" TITLE : unique trace abort codes BODY : idea: use a unique trace abort error code for each distinct point in the jit source code where a trace can be aborted. this way the trace abort reason will unambiguously lead to the specific line of c code where the abort was made. this is to avoid ambiguity e.g. when the abort reason is leaving loop in root trace and there are four different points in the source code that could have generated this error. this will help users to dive into the jit source and understand why a jit error occurred. could either extend lj_traceerr.h with more codes or say automatically log the function/file/line where the abort is invoked.
