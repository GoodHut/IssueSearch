 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/AL/issues/614" TITLE : scope - application areas BODY : hi, i see quite some changes in the application areas . can anyone point me in the right directions on the documentation on this. i have questions like: - how are we supposed to use it in an app - should we/can we create our own application area - how do customers add/remove application areas ... and many more ... it's all quite unclear - but probably very important for the customer journey .. .
