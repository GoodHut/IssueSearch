 URL : "https://github.com/Silv3rPRO/proshine/issues/105" TITLE : enhancement onlevelingup BODY : problem there is no easy way for member specific evolving. description assuming we want to level fast and disable autoevolver and reach the level range of around 98. at that point we would love to enable the auto evolver function again, to get a fully evolved pokemon once we reach lv 100. there are several ways to achieve this, but also problems associated: - testing team level during onpathaction: once highest lv pkm reaches lv 98 enable evolve - problem: mixed teams - if highest is 98 and all others lowleveled, evolve would still be enabled - testing member specific level: to identify which pokemon leveled up, at least experience must be tracked. difficult, but still manageable - problem: what about lv 5 pkm and lv 98 pokemon leveling up during same fight? - onsystemdialog catching: not sure if this even works, but assuming level up would generate a dialog, search the matching teammember, check conditions and anser dialog in response - problem: dialogs tend to use the pokemon name, which could possible have multiple matches in a team. suggestion autoevolver already posses the ability to register a level up. forward this information to the scripter to manipulate it's behaviour. fitting to the current namestyle, e.g.: bool onlevelingup int teamindex which could be manipulated by scripter like this: function onlevelingup teamindex if getpokemonlevel teamindex > 98 then return true end return false end
