 URL : "https://github.com/cmdrmcdonald/EliteDangerousDataProvider/issues/143" TITLE : sync with inara.cz BODY : @jtickle wrote a neat little app that syncs materials with inara.cz. problem is you have to run it each time you want it to update. https://github.com/jtickle/picard seems like this would be an ideal function for an eddi module, it could update inara in real time as materials are collected or used.
