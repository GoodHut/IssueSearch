 URL : "https://github.com/brandonseydel/MailChimp.Net/issues/239" TITLE : updating content html BODY : i've created campaigns successfully, but now i'd like to replace some html. turns out my users have typos, and we just want to do a string replace and update the unsent campaign's html. await mailchimpmanager.content.addorupdateasync campaignid, new contentrequest { html = html} ; this call succeeds. i then refresh the eepurl in the browser, and voila, mailchimp appears to have taken the update. however, if you then go into the mailchimp web ui, and edit that campaign, your changes made by the api have disappeared. what can i do to make my campaign's html changes stick when using manager.contentaddorupdateasync ?
