 URL : "https://github.com/boatrite/soundniblets_slack/issues/4" TITLE : fuzzy search niblet name BODY : i should be able to type /nib i can or /nib ican and have it just find the i can feel it niblet. if there are multiple results, return something like did you mean?... <abc>, <abcd>, <abcdef> if you're feeling saucy, the niblet names could be links that play the niblet when clicked. pretty sure slack can do that
