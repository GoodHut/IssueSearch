 URL : "https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/issues/398" TITLE : custom chanel operators BODY : hello; i notice that i my scripts i often use the same combinations of channel operators in several places. for example, i often want to collect several lists and then transpose them to group items of the same type together: data_1 .combine data_2 .combine data_3 .collect .map{it->it.tranpose } .into{result} as paolo suggested, it is possible to convert this sequence of operators into a function, but i still would find it nicer and cleaner if there would be a mechanism to define a custom channel operator.
