 URL : "https://github.com/tonybaloney/sphinxcontrib-confluencebuilder/issues/16" TITLE : support rest api BODY : this issue will track the enhancement to support confluence's rest api https://developer.atlassian.com/confdev/confluence-server-rest-api . for this enhancement, the following notes are to be taken into consideration: support existing capabilities in this builder over the rest api confluence server 5.5+ . ensure existing xml-rpc api capabilities still work to support legacy confluence systems and custom environments . from initial investigations, i'm leaning towards using the pythonconfluenceapi https://github.com/pushrodtechnology/pythonconfluenceapi to provide the publishing support over rest unless another suggestion is made . when rest support is available, i'm hoping to make it the default publish method, adjust default tox builds to use the rest method and add a specific python 2.7 test environment for the existing xml-rpc confluence package-dependent publisher. this should resolve existing travis ci build issues until the confluence package is correct see issue 9 https://github.com/tonybaloney/sphinxcontrib-confluencebuilder/issues/9 issuecomment-281257144 .
