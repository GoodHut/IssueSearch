 URL : "https://github.com/JuliaMath/FFTW.jl/issues/17" TITLE : rename the package? BODY : as we've been finding recently with iterators.jl vs base.iterators and now fftw.jl vs base.fftw, it causes a lot of weird, annoying issues when packages have the same name as a base module. see for example 13 and https://github.com/juliastats/distributions.jl/issues/631. thus we should probably just follow suit with iterators and rename the package. while it's unfortunate to lose the name fftw, i'm not sure it can be helped in this case. name proposals? cc @stevengj and @tkelman
