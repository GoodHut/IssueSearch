 URL : "https://github.com/allinurl/goaccess/issues/714" TITLE : more performance metrics BODY : i have setup nginx to output the request_time and it's working great. but i'd like to be able to inspect server performance in more detail. below are some ideas in no particular order: - being able to configure my own metrics eg. 90%, 99% quantile instead of avg. and max. - plotting those metrics. as far as i can see only sorting is possible right now, not plotting. the data is already there, so this should be possible with some javascript. - plotting response time distribution ie. response time on the x-axis, number of requests on the y-axis . this would probably only be really useful when filtering is implemented. another fun but not really meaningful thing would be seeing the last 10 or 20 requests url, ip, geolocation, user-agent in a list live as they come in. this is just a gimmick, so i didn't want to open an extra issue for it.
