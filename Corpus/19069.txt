BODY : subresource integrity specifies to get the strongest metadata from the set https://www.w3.org/tr/sri/ get-the-strongest-metadata-from-set of supplied sri constraints, but unfortunately forgot to mention what strongest means in this context. this would be reasonably intuitive for 3 hash functions from the _same_ family shaxxx- , but would already break down for hash functions from a _different_ family, or for something entirely different, like a digital signature scheme. for practical purposes, it's likely best to define _strongest_ as loosely being _newest_, since that would allow a deployment scenario where you can add try out the latest scheme by adding it to the main resource, without having to worry about which clients support it.
