 URL : "https://github.com/puphpet/puphpet/issues/2668" TITLE : php 7.0.19 breaks drupal BODY : @jtreminio i noticed that provisioning php 7.0 now means getting 7.0.19 installed. this version breaks drupal 7 https://www.drupal.org/node/2877243 . though there's a patch and a patch-based workflow is common with drupal, not all circumstances allow this to be a feasible option. any chance you would consider going back to 7.0.17 until that patch has gone into an official release?
