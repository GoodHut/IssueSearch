 URL : "https://github.com/IserveU/IserveU/issues/773" TITLE : status select missing BODY : when you create a motion as a person with the create-motion permission you can't choose the status set as review . you shouldn't be able to see/put publish motion but you should be able to change the status to submitted when you want it to be reviewed. the best solution to this would be creating a button that says submit for review as a save option for people who can't administrate motion. then when you edit your own submitted motion there should be a button to withdraw from review if you want to change it back to a draft.
