 URL : "https://github.com/apple/swift-protobuf/issues/517" TITLE : use in app store app BODY : how am i supposed to use swift-protobuf in an app that is submitted to the app store? during submission i receive the error message: itunes store operation failed. invalid bundle. the application bundle may not contain tools or frameworks provided by apple, or using bundle identifiers in the 'com.apple.' namespace. invalid bundle: swiftprotobuf com.xxx.yyy.pkg/payload/my app.app/contents/frameworks/swiftprotobuf.framework , with bundle identifier 'com.apple.protobuf.swiftprotobuf'. this seems to be a fair assessment and i don't want to submit any code that i compile with an apple bundle identifier. i renamed the swift-protobuf bundle identifier to a custom one and everything now works fine. but is this ok to do so?
