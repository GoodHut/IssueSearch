BODY : hey there ðŸ‘‹ the specs of the mq135 https://www.futurlec.com/datasheet/sensor/mq-135.pdf say it needs 5v to operate. is there some kind of lua-magic to cope for that? ðŸ¤” my understanding was that i needed some kind of voltage divider, to power the sensor with 5v and then bring down the output signal to 3.3v before putting it into the analog input of my nodemcu. greetings from berlin ðŸŒ¤
