 URL : "https://github.com/permissions-dispatcher/PermissionsDispatcher/issues/359" TITLE : migrate lint rules to uast BODY : 331 is most likely caused by the incomplete support of the psi-based api currently used by our lint rules. jetbrains devised a new api called uast unified ast , with a primary goal being to support both java and kotlin. we should migrate our rules over to this new api, which mainly involves renaming a few classes in the best case scenario under the hood, psi is still being used, just the entry points are described differently . my go-to resource for this migration is a thread on google groups https://groups.google.com/forum/ !topic/lint-dev/7nlixa04bam , where tor norbye describes the migration process. let's consider this before the first 3.0.0 alpha release!
