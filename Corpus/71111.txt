 URL : "https://github.com/symphonyoss/ContainerJS/issues/213" TITLE : a better release process BODY : for releases i'd like to see the following: 1. git tags 2. npm releases 3. optional automatic major / minor / patch increments based on the commit history. currently we have 2 , but not 1 , which makes it really hard to determine which version of the codebase relates to each npm version of the code.
