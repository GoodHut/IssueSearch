 URL : "https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/issues/542" TITLE : size of logs in redis BODY : hello, can somebody points me to any options related with size of logs stored in redis? documentation https://mailcow.github.io/mailcow-dockerized-docs/firststeps-logging/ say the redis keys are persistent and will keep up to 5000 lines of logs for the web ui. but executing lrange postfix_maillog 0 -1 shows much more lines. also i am not able to find any option that related with this. is it possible to change this? thanks
