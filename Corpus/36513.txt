 URL : "https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/66" TITLE : how to count floors? BODY : the floor question does not show how to count the floors? in different countries the ground/first floor is counted, in some it is not. when a new osm user uses this app, they do not know how to do it here, so it should definitively be noted somewhere.
