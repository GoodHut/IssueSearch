 URL : "https://github.com/InsolvencyService/LaptopToolKit/issues/8" TITLE : get latest driver versions BODY : @andrewjharrison noted in 6 that we are using fixed versions for the drivers and that we should look into getting the latest by default. github does not have a direct link to the latest release and there is no support from package managers such as apt-get , yum or pip using the github api it is possible via an ajax request to get the latest download link according to a few posts on stack overflow and this would be a feature we should look at implementing when we have a solid foundation. it would be ideal if we could do this for everything that has a fixed version. @sixdaysandy do you think this is possible for us to do?
