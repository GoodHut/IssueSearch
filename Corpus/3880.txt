 URL : "https://github.com/franciscop/umbrella/issues/89" TITLE : .create method BODY : method to create dom element by passing plain object. it could be internal constructor function or using to pass json as a complete element's attributes structure. it's highly useful when creating dom structure without repeating library methods over and over. u parameter, context where parameter is selected as element generator, and context is a plain object: js u <div> , { id: main , class: box , title: click me , on: { click: e => {} } }, u child1 , u child2 , ... ; possible children as an array or next arguments. this is a constructor use, but i think it can be also a simple method to set bunch of attributes at once to existing element or newly created. js u <div> .create { ... } i've got code working like this and could be implemented.
