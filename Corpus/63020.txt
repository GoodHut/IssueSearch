 URL : "https://github.com/alexanderg931/ReviewApp/issues/6" TITLE : date field restrictions BODY : issue: date fields are currently editable description: if someone were to enter a non-standard date format it would cause a bug with sorting. possible solution: one of the following will suffice - remove editability entirely - sanitize the input by forcing a format - implement a date picker, but don't allow direct manipulation of the text.
