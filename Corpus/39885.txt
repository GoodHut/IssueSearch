 URL : "https://github.com/M-o-a-T/owslave/issues/17" TITLE : support for attiny84 BODY : here is my project.cfg : _include: world.cfg env: prog: avrisp devices: _default: _ref: defaults.target.t84 types: _ref: defaults.types code: try1: _doc: my very first 1wire slave device defs: is_onewire: ds2423 onewire_id: x49ae6a524a39 targets: - try1 i had to modify the makefile as well: $ avrdude -c $ prog -p $ mcu_prog -c +$$tf\ needed to be changed to $ avrdude -c $ prog -p t84 -b 19200 -p /dev/ttyacm0 -c +$$tf\ with all this i can run through both make steps and successfully upload burn the code to an attiny84. however the device seems not to work and i assume this is because of a lack of support for the tiny84 in world.cfg as it runs as atmega88: $ make cfg=project.cfg try1 make 1 : entering directory /home/osboxes/sketchbook/cli/owslave' mkdir -p device/try1 mcu:atmega88 mcu_prog:m88 prog:avrisp avrdude:sudo avrdude ... what can i do now? what values do i have to add to world.cfg to get support for t84?
