 URL : "https://github.com/videojs/videojs-contrib-hls/issues/1204" TITLE : how is always in live mode BODY : i use ffmpeg to encode multiple files the file will continue to increase to generate .m3u8, so my m3u8 will always be updated. according to my observation, if m3u8 does not end with ext-x-endlist , it will be in live mode, but this case ext-x-endlist will always exist. is there any way to make the player always live mode?
