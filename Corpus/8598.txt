 URL : "https://github.com/fire-eggs/FamilyLines/issues/40" TITLE : print / preview BODY : <b>notonyournelly codeplex </b> <br />in the experimental branch i have started a couple of variants for implementing print-preview and improved printing. the family.show code supports a basic print of a frameworkelement visual . this is used to print the visible portion of the current view of the family tree. the current view is sized to fit a single page. ideally we should have: option to split across pages control of header, footer, margins. for multi-page print, need an option to mark pages for taping together, e.g. quota1quot for first upper left page, quota2quot, etc across, then quotb1quot for first page of second row. or quot1,1quot, quot1,2quot... print preview of what would actually print, multi-page view, etc. appearance which uses the themes and appears to be part of the program a quotsystemquot that will be usable for reports, e.g. the data from the family view grid. i've got a view of the full current tree showing in a couple of print preview variants. there are issues with each variant. a complete solution needs to be finished. some of the problems i've encountered: no multi-page view multi-page view but without control over header/footer print preview by creating a flowdocument, yet printing the flowdocument generates gibberish text for page 2 onwards
