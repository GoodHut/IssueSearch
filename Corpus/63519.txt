 URL : "https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr/issues/1514" TITLE : eeg data classification BODY : i have different eeg data sets related to four conditions: no stimulation, 10,12 and 14 hz stimulation. these three conditions are always 32, mixed within approximately 750 no stimulation. i simply need to know the precision of the classification of my learner for each data set independently. i used the following syntax: classif.task = makeclassiftask data = data, target = stimulation lrn = makefilterwrapper learner= classif.naivebayes , fw.method= information.gain , predict.type = prob , fw.perc = 0.5, fix.factors.prediction = true mod = train lrn, classif.task rdesc = makeresampledesc method = subsample , stratify = true r = resample learner = lrn, task = classif.task, resampling = rdesc, show.info = false pred = predict mod, task = classif.task pred print calculateconfusionmatrix pred, relative = t i'm missing something or i'm correct?
