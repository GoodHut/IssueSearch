 URL : "https://github.com/open-forcefield-group/smirnoff99Frosst/issues/44" TITLE : ffxml format with smirff BODY : there are variety of lines in the smirnoff ffxml files that have the word smirff, such as the following: <smirff version= 0.1 aromaticity_model= oearomodel_mdl > these should presumably changed to smirnoff, but i didn't want to make changes that might break the forcefield code. also the version isn't really for smirnoff, it should be for smirnoff99frosst.
