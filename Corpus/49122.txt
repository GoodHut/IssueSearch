BODY : first of all, everthing works well. very thanks for your working on this awesome lib. but in china, telegram is been blocked by gov. when deploying the bot in china, it's unable to reply message to the api server, can receive message from telegram. i tried to set up a sock5 proxy, but failed. is there any plan for supporting the sock5 proxy? ! image https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2503423/22633710/d62f7b6e-ec5e-11e6-870f-ace293672f04.png
