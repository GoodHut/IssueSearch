 URL : "https://github.com/RobinLinus/autofill-phishing/issues/1" TITLE : i don't get it BODY : i am tech savvy, but i don't get how this works i have not read the article yet, so i am purely trying your app . when i saw firefox desktop users are immune, i switched to chromium, but it still does not do anything. basically i am entering some name, but nothing happens. --- i think i get it now. i must enter my name as it might be saved by autofill however as i cannot use my primary browser firefox and i have no autosave data in chromium, i am left here. maybe you should add a first page to enter some data, which is saved.
