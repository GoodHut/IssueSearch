 URL : "https://github.com/Igalia/chromium/issues/301" TITLE : unable to build chromium BODY : hey igalia-team, first of all thanks for your work! i really would like to test your wayland patches. i cloned your git repository, switched inside the chromium directory and run: $ gn args out/ozone --args= use_ozone=true enable_package_mash_services=true use_xkbcommon=true gn.py: could not find checkout in any parent of the current path. this must be run inside a checkout. running gclient runhooks error: client not configured; see 'gclient config' also doesn't seem to solve the issue : i guess i missed a step? best regards, jonas
