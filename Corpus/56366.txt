 URL : "https://github.com/fjarri/Jute.jl/issues/12" TITLE : multi-process test run BODY : it would be nice to have an ability to run testcases in parallel. we have a list of tests ready, and we know all their dependencies, so it should be doable. one problem here is that we cannot pass functions between processes, so each process will have to perform its own test file loading. after that, tests can be identified by their path. fixture values can be identified by their indices, so we do not have to pass them either. the interaction of this feature with exclusive fixtures issue 11 will, probably, be pretty awkward.
