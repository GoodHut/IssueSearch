 URL : "https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/issues/507" TITLE : pass flash to react BODY : it would make sense to pass the rails flash to react's initial_state, and then call showalert on any notices. this would out of the box have a neat little you have signed in notice. it would also allow controllers to redirect to /web with a notice for example, if authorize_follow is called on someone the user is already following, redirect to their account with a you are already following @gargron notice.
