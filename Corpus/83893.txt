 URL : "https://github.com/gatling/gatling/issues/3364" TITLE : compile gatling w/ java 9 BODY : setting source and target to 8 is not enough to retain compatibility with java 8. for example, when compiling with java 9 and targeting java 8 bytecode with just source and target compiler options, we crash at runtime with a nosuchmethodexception when calling flip on a bytebuffer because bytebuffer flip now overloads buffer flip . it seems we're support to set a bootclasspath . not sure how to do that with scalac, not if it's worth it. we'll maybe only build with java 9 once we'll drop java 8 support.
