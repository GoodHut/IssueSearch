> > vignetting correction seems to be the only thing missing for this lens canon ef-s 24mm pancake , and that's a shame because it's really bad at big apertures.
> i took a few shots of a white ceiling through 2 sheets of paper and attached here. couldn't get calibrate.py to work i think because i didn't do the distortion shots . i'll keep trying but in the meantime here are my files. hope they're uniform enough to be useful.
