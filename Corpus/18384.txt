 URL : "https://github.com/NGO-DB/ndb-core/issues/70" TITLE : sync / login loop BODY : the problem is when the user can be authenticated on the remote database but somehow not locally. i had this problem currently on the entity_mapper branch. the local login fails username / password not correct because of the prefix change . however, due to the failed local login the logincomponent get's stuck in a loop. first onloginfailure is called, which then calls retryloginaftersync , which subscribes to the database sync status and then because the sync actually works will be notified about the completed sync, which then leads to another call to login , which triggers another remote authentication and because this works and the local authentication not , this triggers a new sync and the whole procedure from onloginfailure starts again.
