 URL : "https://github.com/cuproPanda/QRY/issues/4" TITLE : mod filename clarity BODY : it's sometimes hard to pick out a mod in the mod files list/folders list due to the name being obfuscated with author names that ruin sort order and abbreviations that remove direct communication. some examples of hard-to-understand names are ohu drop ships which can't be found under the reasonable expectation of drop ship, mf a16, which gives almost no information that leads a person to understand -- let alone find -- that it is the more floors mod, rd floorbeautyrebalance which can't be found under floor, and jtreplacewalls which isn't sorted to replace walls. an example of easy-to-understand naming is rimsenal - federation, part of a series of rimsenal mods in an expected place.
