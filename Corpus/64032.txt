 URL : "https://github.com/askmike/gekko/issues/1251" TITLE : fiat or coins to start? BODY : just a quick question rather than an issue. i've been playing around with back tests for a while and just deployed my first real bot on a gdax account with a small amount of ethereum. is the starting balance important in any way? ie should it be euros or ethereum in the account when trading on eth-eur or does it not really matter. if i have eth, the first trade will be a sell, the other way around if it's euros? cheers
