 URL : "https://github.com/LoneGazebo/Community-Patch-DLL/issues/2979" TITLE : question about flavors BODY : i recently implemented a change where leaders' willingness to settle a bad spot depends on their expansion flavor. now i was quite surprised to find boudicca settle in the arctic. apparently getflavormanager ->getindividualflavor flavortypes gc.getinfotypeforstring flavor_expansion returns 22. however in the leader_flavors table in the database it says only 7. where does this difference come from?
