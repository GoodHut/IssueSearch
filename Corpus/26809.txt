 URL : "https://github.com/spulec/moto/issues/948" TITLE : can't use responses BODY : with v1, since moto vendors in responses , it's impossible to use responses for mocking non-aws calls. example: py with _responses.requestsmock as rsps: rsps.add rsps.get, 'http://foo' with moto.mock_sns : requests.get 'http://foo' this used to work on < v1, on v1 it raises a connection refused error because basically requests is patched twice
