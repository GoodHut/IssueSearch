 URL : "https://github.com/andreamazz/AMScrollingNavbar/issues/286" TITLE : followers offset broken BODY : i have the following setting: - navigation controller with collection view and a blur view that is behind the otherwise transparent navbar - this blur view is added to the followers array - a child controller accessible thru show segue on tap of a cell in the collection view what happens: - if i tap the cell to show the child controller and the navbar is fully visible at that time, all is fine - if i tap the cell to show the child controller and the navbar is hidden scrolled out behind top of screen when i close that child controller to go back to my original collection view, the navbar is automatically shown but the follower blur view is in the same hidden position as i left it. from now on the follower is always offset by that navbar height and even tho it's being shown/hidden correctly with the navbar but it's in a wrong position at all times. - repeating the exercise further offsets the blur view rendering it completely invisible out of bounds of the screen thanks
