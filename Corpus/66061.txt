 URL : "https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/issues/709" TITLE : make callbackquery safe BODY : botogram https://botogram.pietroalbini.org/ implemented a safe way to handle callback queries as you can read in the documentation https://botogram.pietroalbini.org/docs/dev/buttons/ buttons-security the problem is that the callback_data is not sent by telegram, but the clients. so if a bot is admin of a group and it lets ban spamming users with buttons and the callback_data containts parameters for example ban_user:123456789 a maliciuos client could change the parameter for example ban_user:987654321 .
