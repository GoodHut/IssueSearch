 URL : "https://github.com/julmot/mark.js/issues/142" TITLE : include color in options BODY : hi, can you please include an option for style. we have a scenario where the highlight color is selected by user and hence we cannot have predefined class. so it will be better if you can just add a style option, which will supersede classname option if both specified. i have written the code for same and included in the attached. please check comment code by amit for the area where i have updated the code. thanks, mark-amit.txt https://github.com/julmot/mark.js/files/1044412/mark-amit.txt
