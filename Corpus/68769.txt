 URL : "https://github.com/BrunoBernardino/Oikon2-Mac/issues/3" TITLE : shortcuts are too eager BODY : people have reported confusion with cmd+f, cmd+i, and cmd+o always going to oikon when open, even if it's not the focused app. a solution would be to register/unregister the shortcuts on window focus / blur https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/1334 issuecomment-276726723 . another alternative is using the electron-localshortcut https://github.com/parro-it/electron-localshortcut package.
