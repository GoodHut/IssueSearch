 URL : "https://github.com/erikdoe/ccmenu/issues/82" TITLE : propose cc.xml schema v2 BODY : i would like to propose extending the cc.xml schema a little bit in order to address two current limitations: inability to mark unstable builds and providing a link to the build console in addition to the existing one which is a link to the job doing the builds . sadly wikis cannot be forked via github interface so i had to clone it. here is the proposed version: https://github.com/ssbarnea/ccmenu/wiki/multiple-project-summary-reporting-standard once we agree on a specification, i can do the work to update jenkins implementation to support it, ccmenu being the first client to support it.
