 URL : "https://github.com/slim-template/slim/issues/759" TITLE : componenting my views. BODY : i would like to slit my views into components. how can i achieve this? for example: slim body post-list posts=@posts with relevant post-list-component.slim slim ul - posts.each do |post| li = post.title i suspect that it is not possible with a current implementation of slim. is it possible to solve by creating appropriate slim plugin?
