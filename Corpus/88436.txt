 URL : "https://github.com/lomik/go-carbon/issues/159" TITLE : no data in query response BODY : in aws, using grafana 4.2.0 with go-carbon 1.9.1, talking to carbonapi, which is talking to embedded carbonserver in go-carbon. i can use whisper-fetch.py on the carbon server itself and there is data present. if i try to use curl, it appears to transact successfully exit 0 but doesn't return any data. in grafana i get no datapoints and the developer console throws an error indicating there was no data attribute in the response. things i've tried: different versions of go-carbon, opening up inbound/outbound acls on the security groups to permit all traffic. routing tables are simple, 0.0.0.0/0 to the internet and local for everything else on the subnet. tcpdump shows the packets coming in, strace shows the calls writing metrics to disk. i don't seem to be able to debug queries otherwise. nothing useful in any logfile anywhere even with raised loglevels -- the carbonapi logs simply correlate that there was 0 response data sent. thanks in advance for any help.
