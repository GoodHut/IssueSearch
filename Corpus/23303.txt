 URL : "https://github.com/Ultimaker/cura-build/issues/125" TITLE : otool error on mac BODY : hello, i am trying to build using the cura-build project on the mac. i have successfully built the build environment and am referencing it. everything builds, until what appears to be one of the last steps. i get a bunch of this: fatal error: otool: internal objdump command failed error: install_name_tool: input file: build/cura.app/contents/macos/resources/meshes/printrbot_simple_metal_upgrade.stl is not a mach-o file /opt/local/libexec/llvm-3.9/bin/llvm-objdump: 'build/cura.app/contents/macos/resources/meshes/printrbot_simple_metal_upgrade.stl': the file was not recognized as a valid object file it references what appears to be all of the files that would be part of the application, and i am not finding much information on this. any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!
