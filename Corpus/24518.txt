 URL : "https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-webpack/issues/12" TITLE : support for react? BODY : first of all: thanks a lot for making this, it is very promising, especially due to its tight integration with electron-builder! my app is based on react, but the current configuration doesn't seem to support this. if i try to include electron-webpack, it complains invalid tokens in jsx files. is there a chance to create a react adapter for electron-webpack?
