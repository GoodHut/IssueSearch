BODY : updating from protocolsupport b48 to b49 caused player crashing. https://www.ecocitycraft.com/forum/threads/java-errors.165351/ reverting the plugin to b48 fixed it. i myself was able to reproduce on 1.11.2 client and java 8 u 131. server java is on 8 u 131 - doubt this has anything to do with it though, just thought i'd mention. ps: making this issue in case you guys don't notice the commit comment.
