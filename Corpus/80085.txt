 URL : "https://github.com/Celebrandil/CudaSift/issues/15" TITLE : systematic point density BODY : first, many thanks for keeping this project live. below, i have an example image that i am attempting to extract key points for. i am getting very strange systematic point distribution where the top of the higher has a significantly higher number of points. in the example image, keypoints are still identified across the rest of the image. in some cases, no points are found outside of the top of the image. i am not sure if the total number of points siftdata.maxpts is being exceeded here https://github.com/celebrandil/cudasift/blob/maxwell/cudasifth.cu l168 and therefore breaking early? any insight appreciated. ! ctx_example https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2105468/23884552/8a22ce96-082a-11e7-8b86-9a9f3f5623a2.png
