 URL : "https://github.com/cite-architecture/ScalaJS-CITE-Environment/issues/13" TITLE : export findings as 82xf BODY : we're all about scholarship, there should be ubiquitous export findings buttons for: - grabbing the text you are looking at as 82xf. - grabbing any generated list of urns as 82xf. perhaps with an intial header-line, e.g.: source: ngram urns: threshold = 3; ignore-punctuation = true; queried on 'urn:cts:greeklit:tlg0016.tlg001.eng:'. or source: urn:cts:greeklit:tlg0016.tlg001.eng:1.3-1.5 ???
