 URL : "https://github.com/mp911de/lettuce/issues/476" TITLE : redis connection to uds BODY : hello, version: 4.3.0.final java version: 8 1.8.0_121-b13 - oracle when connecting to redis using unix domain sockets, i get the following warnings: 18:15:05.844 lettuce-eventexecutorloop-1-1 warn io.netty.bootstrap.bootstrap - unknown channel option 'so_keepalive' for channel ' id: 0x688c6e87 ' 18:15:05.845 lettuce-eventexecutorloop-1-1 warn io.netty.bootstrap.bootstrap - unknown channel option 'tcp_nodelay' for channel ' id: 0x688c6e87 ' so netty is complaining there's some options set in the parent and handler i'm just guessing to be honest . at least that's what it looks like? i can have a look at it on wednesday, just wanted to post it here in case it's a known error, sounds like an easy fix! thanks!
