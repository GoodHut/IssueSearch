 URL : "https://github.com/jamiestraw/streaker/issues/3" TITLE : 🐙 create app icon BODY : it would be nice to have an app icon even though it is only ever seen when: 1. installing the app 2. viewing login items 3. viewing applications an icon will add extra polish to the app and can also be used in the readme similarly to my other project, afk https://github.com/jamiestraw/afk . the octocat icon could potentially be used inside the standard macos style icon with a colour?
