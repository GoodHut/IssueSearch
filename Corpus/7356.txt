 URL : "https://github.com/swri-robotics/marti_common/issues/482" TITLE : fix catkin lint BODY : there are numerous instances of catkin errors and warnings in this repository. there's now a ci check for them that's allowed to fail. fix the errors and make the ci check required. note: it looks like catkin_lint can't expand macros, so it throws spurious errors about installing non-existent targets for swri_nodelet_add_node targets.
