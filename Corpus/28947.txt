 URL : "https://github.com/elgatosf/jonah/issues/11" TITLE : improve help output BODY : when you run the jonah command without any arguments, it prints out a list of commands. these should be improved: - a sensible order instead of being ordered alphabetically - grouped by intent development, deployment, etc example: initialize initialize a new jonah project in the current directory build build the image. cleanbuild build the image from scratch instead of relying on cached layers. develop run dev server reload reload django process on dev server shell get a shell on the dev server stop stop a previously running development server test build and run unit tests compilemessages compile internationalization strings tag add git and docker tags stage deploy to staging deploy deploy to production. this command will ask you for a tag before pushing anything to the server direct_deploy deploy as tag master on production server, without warning and without asking for confirmation clean delete exited containers, dangling images, and volumes. good to clean up hard drive space.
