 URL : "https://github.com/theliturgists/cms/issues/3" TITLE : create tile component BODY : the tile component there may be a better name - open to suggestions! can be found in many areas of the app including but not limited to : - the podcasts https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main /console/12356801/263500799/preview view - the meditations view - the liturgies view requirements: - must have an image default image if not available - possibly greyed out liturgists logo. talk to @tannerhearne and @samchurney about this when the time comes . - note that some uses of the tiles have durations while others have number of episodes. must support multiple types podcasts/liturgies/etc. note: it might be possible to combine this component with the card component - is this a good idea? up for discussion...
