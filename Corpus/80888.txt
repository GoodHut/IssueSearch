 URL : "https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/api-python/issues/12" TITLE : use numpydoc docstrings? BODY : it would be more clear how this package fits into the python science ecosystem if the docstrings followed the numpydoc format here is its explanation https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/howto_document.rst.txt . this basically entails writing parameters etc with the following form: python def my_function a, b=none : do my function. this function does blah blah. parameters ----------- a : int | float explanation of a. b : string | none explanation of b. returns -------- something : instance of xxx explanation of something and so on... i think this would make the documentation more readable, and it'd make it possible to build api docs on the web quite easily. what are thoughts on using this?
