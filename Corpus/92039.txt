 URL : "https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/archivers.space/issues/75" TITLE : user groups functionality BODY : this function will be great for organizers because when we send out invitations for folks attending our event, we'll have better visibility on who's active and who still needs help. as an admin/organizer, you can see pending invitations and roles for each person and grant permissions in one page instead of looking for the user, then clicking on their account, then granting permissions. plus, this will make it easy for the reporting functionality i suggested earlier to easily measure impact of each event.
