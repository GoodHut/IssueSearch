 URL : "https://github.com/Minecolonies/minecolonies/issues/1105" TITLE : crash on startup BODY : i got a crash on minecolonies version: 1.11.2-0.8.1784 forge 13.20.0.2282 crash log: https://pastebin.com/pa5irs4t it says something to do with the block render? 9/10 whenever i use a mod it always says it has issues with block renders/finding a specific file. its gotten to the point that if i get this error i dump the mod and walk away and come back a few versions later, but this time i felt like submitting the error, even on the off chance i'm that one in a million crashes that crashed because of a bug so obscure only one other person has ever had it and no-one can re-create it. hope this helps and you guys can tell me what i did wrong! i'm going to use an older version for now, hopefully that works.
