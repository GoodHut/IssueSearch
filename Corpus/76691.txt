 URL : "https://github.com/sscarduzio/elasticsearch-readonlyrest-plugin/issues/162" TITLE : logstash failing on head BODY : apologies if i'm missing something obvious here, but logstash seems to be failing when performing a head with the following: - name: logstash auth_key_sha1: 57319463de6c07d251516a65e04beea4e35a1122 type: allow actions: indices:data/read/ , indices:data/write/ , indices:admin/template/ , indices:admin/create , cluster:monitor/ indices: gc-company-search , <no-index> testing the same call with get seems to be fine, any ideas what the issue is?
