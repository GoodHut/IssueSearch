 URL : "https://github.com/vibhavp/erc-twitch/issues/5" TITLE : warnings on installation BODY : i have 3 warnings when installing this package: erc-twitch.el:58:62:warning: reference to free variable url-http-end-of-headers' erc-twitch.el:93:1:warning: unused lexical variable end-pos' erc-twitch.el:93:1:warning: unused lexical variable start-pos' ultimately the option erc-twitch-enable is not available after the install and i suspect this might be related to the warningins above.
