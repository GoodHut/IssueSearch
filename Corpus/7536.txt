 URL : "https://github.com/ragnar2017/prj-rev-bwfs-dasmoto/issues/2" TITLE : good use of div BODY : i really like that you split your html into sections by wrapping the code in divs and putting the id on the div. this will be really important as project grow in size and we get into positioning. also you don't need to indent the p-tag further than the h3 as they are all siblings. https://github.com/ragnar2017/prj-rev-bwfs-dasmoto/blob/master/dasmotosartsandcrafts/index.html l12-l19
