 URL : "https://github.com/monounity/karma-typescript/issues/87" TITLE : how to use es6 library BODY : hi, i wanted to use lodash-es in my angular 2 project, but understandably as it is es6 only package , it fails with error: invalid syntax in bundle: 'import' and 'export' may only appear at the top level . this package works well with typescript, rollup and webpack, so it would be nice to be able to use it. is there any way to use such libraries with karma-typescript?
