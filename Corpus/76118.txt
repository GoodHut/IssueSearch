 URL : "https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/8868" TITLE : infinite 404s for images BODY : as a result of https://github.com/tryghost/ghost/commit/147ec911620148ad735a629849907cc9910ae35b, if an image that is referenced in your error template 404s, you will get infinite 404 errors. similarly, if you have lots of resource-based 404 errors and are using casper, which uses the {{ get}} helper on the error page, you'll end up with a really large number of database requests all of a sudden. plan of action: - put guards in place to not render templates as a 404 response to a 404ing resource request - further improvements to the image size utilities, to try to guard against multiple requests - change casper to have an explicit 404 error template, and less fancy fallback error template
