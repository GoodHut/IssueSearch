 URL : "https://github.com/SimJeg/FC-DenseNet/issues/22" TITLE : question about the m=1088 BODY : hi, i've got a question here: > first upsampling, m = 656 + 15x16 + 12x16 = 1088 in your code here: https://github.com/simjeg/fc-densenet/blob/master/fc-densenet.py l98-l108 it seems that the output stack in line 92 wasn't been used in the rest of the network, is that right? also, it looks like every output stack of dbs in upsample path were unused, since this line: stack = transitionup skip_connection_list i , block_to_upsample, n_filters_keep tu overwrite stack every time after a db. if the assumption above is correct, the m of first upsampling should be 656 + 12x16 = 848 have i missed something?
