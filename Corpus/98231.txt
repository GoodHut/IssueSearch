 URL : "https://github.com/c9s/SessionKit/issues/2" TITLE : inconsistant class methods BODY : hi again : you have two state object alternative. as far as i seen you would to manage the session issue with client cookies or native php session implementation. but you have a lot of different public methods in each other class. i think you need to implement same interface and invisible internal methods in your state implementations. i mean if i choice any alternative, i shouldn't be thought implementation internals. so you need to implement an interface that contains getsid and generatesid methods. and each state object alternatives should have same behaviour. currently i implemented a state interface in my side. i can make a contribution if you want.
