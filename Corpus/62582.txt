 URL : "https://github.com/SiliconStudio/xenko/issues/563" TITLE : constant high cpu usage BODY : when i looked at the gamestudio and i tried two of the initial samples. after i tried the samples, the gamestudio constantly uses 60% cpu on my i5 although i do nothing in the editor and just scroll around the assests and all things were already complied . i waited 20 minutes if it gets better and some background work finishes, but the cpu usage stayed high. what is the editor doing all the time? after closing xenko game editor, the connectionrouter and effectscompiler stays alive and uses cpu. ! xenko-connectionrouter https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7339098/24578453/e8ac5db4-16e0-11e7-997b-c361aa14566c.png ! xenko-high-cpu https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7339098/24578454/e8ae51d2-16e0-11e7-89ae-c679c795b290.png
