 URL : "https://github.com/react-tools/react-form/issues/196" TITLE : form field render prop BODY : i've been trying to get my app updated to the latest version of react form i'm on 1.3.0 at the moment , but it would appear that using a render prop for custom form fields has regressed since the previous version, making updating the package require rewriting my custom inputs. are there plans to support render props and functions as children again?
