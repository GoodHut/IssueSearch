 URL : "https://github.com/pcfens/puppet-ca_cert/issues/25" TITLE : wget creates empty file BODY : after doing some googling it seems that wget will create an empty file even if there was a problem accessing the specified url. i've had this happen a few times and the module does not fix it since it only checks for the presence of the desired file. possible solutions are: wget url -o file || rm -f file - or - curl -f http://nonexistent/file.jpg -o localfile.jpg i don't know which is preferred so if you have an opinion on one over the other i'll submit a pull request with the changes.
