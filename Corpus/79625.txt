 URL : "https://github.com/openhab/openhab2-addons/issues/1765" TITLE : sonos clear player queue BODY : the current sonos addon does not provide a channel to clear the current queue of a player. the playlist channel only allows to add tracks from a playlist to a player's queue. thus, when using the playlist channel multiple times on the same player with different playlists, the queue will represent a mix of the playlists added. in many use cases, a user would prefer to clear the queue so to only play tracks from the selected playlist. my proposal is to implement a new channel to enable the user to clear the queue of a player. keeping the playlist and clearqueu channel separated, will allow the user to choose the behaviour when adding tracks to the queue.
