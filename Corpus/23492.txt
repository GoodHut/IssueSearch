 URL : "https://github.com/ludumdare/ludumdare/issues/858" TITLE : post editor broken BODY : after text fills up the text editor box, it will force the browser to scroll back up to the top of the page whenever a key is pressed. this essentially makes it impossible to have a post longer than what the text box can hold without scrolling, unless you compose your post in another text editor and paste it in the text box.
