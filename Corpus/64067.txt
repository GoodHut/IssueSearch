 URL : "https://github.com/dbcarrasco/predict_restaurant_rating/issues/14" TITLE : final peer review xz577 BODY : the project goal is trying to predict restaurants rating based on their characteristics, and comments gathered from tripadvisor. areas that i like about the report: 1. i like the fact the team has carefully considered why and how to get their data. it's impressive how they can customize their own dataset by web scraping with as little bias as possible. 2. the team did a great job on feature selection and feature engineering. starting from exploratory visualization, we can get a basic but clear sense of the dataset. followed by feature selection sections on utilizing very fancy technics. 3. for predictive modeling parts, i like the way the team lay out their structured thoughts. the charts and tables also supports the process very well. area for improvement: 1. it's great the team is able to utilize some feature selection approach beyond what our class has covered, but i'm also interested to see how the technics we have covered like lasso performs over the same dataset. may it yields less complex features? 2. adding on the complex features from previous point, i wonder if decision tree models and random forests are good choice here. plus, is it fair to not use the 3 features associated with the user reviews ratings for tree models? overall, i think the team did a great job.
