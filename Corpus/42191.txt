 URL : "https://github.com/tue-robotics/tue_robocup/issues/524" TITLE : amigo2 not responding BODY : i have experienced several times, that a terminal to amigo2 is not responding when not used for a few minutes. i also noticed problems with the trigger topic. amigo doesn't respond to the trigger, when you ping or open a new ssh session. amigo does respond again. https://github.com/tue-robotics/tue-env/pull/196 might show more insight in this, but this is not the cause, so it isn't solving the issue.
