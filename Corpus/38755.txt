 URL : "https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/issues/1173" TITLE : question about proxy BODY : hi, i'm trying to proxy all requests /api/ to localhost:3000/api/ . no luck for the moment. i tried to add the following snippet in dev object of file config/index.js . but it didn't take effect. proxytable: { '/api': { target: 'http://localhost:3000', secure: false, changeorigin: true // no matter this is true or false } } the browser kept failing with 404 for api requests e.g. http://localhost:8080/api/login . so question: 1. how to correctly proxy all requests localhost/api/ front-end to localhost:3000/api/ back-end ? 2. i found that i will visit index.html with arbitrary link e.g. http://localhost:8080/123/abc/!@$ / . why?
