 URL : "https://github.com/lat9/edit_orders/issues/60" TITLE : shipping and tax BODY : in most stores in the nordics, shipping etc. is displayed including tax in order totals. but in edit orders it seems to be handled as it's exclusive tax, so extra tax is added for shipping on recalculation. this means the store admin would have to remove the tax from the shipping price before updating the order, else the tax total will be incorrect. tested on zc 1.5.5e and table shipping. tax base is shipping still, same if set to store . php 5.6
