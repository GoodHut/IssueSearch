 URL : "https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml/issues/73" TITLE : using fallback fonts BODY : is it possible to define a font stack like in css where multiple font names are given, and the first one that matches an installed font is used? for example, i might prefer helvetica, but that is not available on my colleagues windows or linux computer. i would expect something like this to work: skinparam defaultfontname helvetica, arial, open sans is this not implemented or is there a special syntax?
