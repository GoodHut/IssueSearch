 URL : "https://github.com/sheikalthaf/ngx-carousel/issues/53" TITLE : vertical carousel option BODY : hi @sheikalthaf, first, thanks for this library, i used ngx-slick in my angular app before using ngx-carousel and now my app is faster because ngx-slick has jquery as dependency. but there is an option in ngx-slick that would be great in your library : vertical carousel. ðŸ˜ƒ do you think it's possible to implement it ?
