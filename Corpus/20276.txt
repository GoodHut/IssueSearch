BODY : hi all, i would really prefer to install iocage from its github src, but there's an outstanding issue with one of the dependencies on trueos. that means i'll use pkg for this - no problem! i often use freshports for my pkg/port reference: https://www.freshports.org/sysutils/py3-iocage/ % sudo pkg install py36-iocage updating trueos-base repository catalogue... trueos-base repository is up to date. updating trueos-major repository catalogue... trueos-major repository is up to date. all repositories are up to date. pkg-static: no packages available to install matching 'py36-iocage' have been found in the repositories i see it here with a slightly different name: https://github.com/trueos/freebsd-ports/tree/trueos-master/sysutils/py3-iocage % sudo pkg install sysutils/py3-iocage updating trueos-base repository catalogue... trueos-base repository is up to date. updating trueos-major repository catalogue... trueos-major repository is up to date. all repositories are up to date. pkg-static: no packages available to install matching 'sysutils/py3-iocage' have been found in the repositories questions: where is iocage? why does my pkg say pkg-static ? can you install iocage? if so, how?
