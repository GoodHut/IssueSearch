 URL : "https://github.com/Storj/storjshare-gui/issues/653" TITLE : npm run release on fedora BODY : using all the correct directions, the only problem i've run into trying to compile storj from source in fedora is that when you get to the npm run release phase, it fails on fakeroot/dpkg-deb instructions given to it. i've never heard of using dpkg in fedora for package building, but i'm sure it's doable, i just don't know where to begin. i'm sure i'm one of the few people running fedora and trying to run storjshare-gui as well, so i'm not requesting a special release or anything, maybe just some pointers to get to that final hurdle, as the other options aren't working for me either. it's saying that it's on test network but i've put it into production mode; apparently according to 571 this does not mean i'm not actually on the network. i had no choice about fedora because every time ubuntu pushes out a minor update they manage to put me into a login loop with a gpu i have mining on that machine. it's very frustrating yet fedora's driver management seems to be working for me so far. so i'd like some pointers on how to patch my storjshare to overcome the fakeroot/dpkg-deb hurdle it's facing -- without going to the trouble of installing a whole ubuntu vm.
