 URL : "https://github.com/ma1co/OpenMemories-Framework/issues/10" TITLE : creating a wiki / docu BODY : i think it would be amazing to have a place where we could collect and share our knowledge about the framework. is there already a plan on creating something like this? i have a virtual server if there is a demand i could set up a wiki. ps: @ma1co thank you for this amazing work! i got my camera last week and i'm only developing instead of taking pictures ^^
