 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19925" TITLE : drag for multiple cursors BODY : - vscode version: 1.9.0 - os version: manjaro linux 16.10.3 could you include a feature similar to what sublime text has, where you can hold alt and drag your mouse with the right button clicked to create multiple cursors on different lines? i really feel like this feature is missing. thanks a lot!
