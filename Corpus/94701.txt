 URL : "https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem/issues/671" TITLE : chemical space exploration BODY : i wanted to open this one up to discussion. deepchem has built up a variety of high-quality models, some of which can actually get quite far with the limited public data out there. today, we can take in an arbitrary molecule and estimate its properties reasonably well. what's missing imo is a good way of going from molecule to molecule, which is holding back our ability to do drug optimization here. i'm not sure about autoencoders. it seems like a nice idea, but they don't really have much respect for synthesizability. i'm not sure hallucinating lstms are much better? in some ways i think matched molecular pairs might be the easiest option for now http://rdkit.blogspot.com/2014/08/mmpa-on-chembl-herg-data-using-pandas.html . thoughts?
