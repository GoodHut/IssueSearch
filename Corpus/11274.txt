 URL : "https://github.com/DanielKeep/cargo-script/issues/44" TITLE : full toml header BODY : i love the idea of this! one thing that i think would be very useful is a full toml header. i propose the following syntax -- which must be followed exactly / ! cargo script dependencies toml = 4.2.3 ... etc / basically we will just do a regex for r /\ ! cargo script . \ / enabling multi-line mode and we will allow the user to specify the full cargo.toml! this will automatically fill in required non-dependency details package.name and package.version , unless they are specified in which case it won't touch them.
