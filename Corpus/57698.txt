 URL : "https://github.com/catalogueglobal/datatools-server/issues/51" TITLE : redundant jobtype enum BODY : in the monitorablejob class we have an enum listing the types of monitorable jobs. however monitorable jobs are all represented by subclasses of the monitorablejob class. this enum is redundant. each subclass should either override a function returning a unique string, or perhaps better the shared superclass should just define a public function returning the simple class name so it's visible when the instances are serialized to json.
