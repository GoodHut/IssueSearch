| severity | high| vulnerability description
this script is possibly vulnerable to code execution attacks. code injection vulnerabilities occur where the output or content served from a web application can be manipulated in such a way that it triggers server-side code execution. in some poorly written web applications that allow users to modify server-side files such as by posting to a message board or guestbook it is sometimes possible to inject code in the scripting language of the application itself. attack details
