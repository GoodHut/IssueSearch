 URL : "https://github.com/feenkcom/gt4gemstone/issues/44" TITLE : broken instance/class view BODY : pharo5.0 commit a2b75e4: ! image https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/623951/24727697/ceca59ae-1a0b-11e7-8a0a-06c8a6b4c961.png no methods visible for selected class on either instance or class side. on class-side only conversions protocol is shown empty and on instance-side an empty accessing protocol is show regardless of selected class ... prior to opening the category browser, i had opened a symbollist browser, but didn't click around... now that i've opened a symbollist browser the protocols were working until i hit a walk back: ! image https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/623951/24727933/b4b26f24-1a0c-11e7-8237-585b2d8922fd.png and now i see that gtgsbareclient is on the stack, but i have logged into a stone with tode included so it probably shouldn't be using the bare client? probably need a way to specify whther or not you need a bare client when using the sessions handler? nice to potentially be able to open different browsers from sessions handler...
