 URL : "https://github.com/bedita/bedita/issues/1286" TITLE : error response priority BODY : we need a predictable error response priority in case of multiple possible errors. example requests: 1. get /documents/xxxxx 2. get /documentsxxxxx with a missing/wrong api key and security.blockanonymousapps set to true we get: 1. 406 bad content type on missing or wrong accept header - 403 with right accept 2. 404 always, with wrong/right accept or with bad/good api key what's the expected behavior? priority proposal: 1. 403 on missing/wrong api key if api key is mandatory 1. 401 in case of unauthenticated request, when authentication is requested 1. 406 if there's a content negotiation problem probably 405 and 415 too 1. 404 if requested resource was not found or other possible errors like 400 or 500 this will help us in diagnostics, logging & assistance
