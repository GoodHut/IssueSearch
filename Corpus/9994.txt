 URL : "https://github.com/Chocobo1/foo_xspf_1/issues/5" TITLE : add upl support? BODY : hello, would it be possible to add upl http://universalplaylist.stavros.io/ support to this plugin? it's a format i wrote that aims to do what xspf does, but is more modern and standardizes more features. i've been trying to write editor plugins, but my c++ isn't great, so any help would be appreciated.
