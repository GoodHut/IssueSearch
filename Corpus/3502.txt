 URL : "https://github.com/mozilla/PollBot/issues/9" TITLE : push or pull? BODY : in our meeting today we discovered that it's not clear what part of pollbot actually gathers data from bedrock, et. al. i heard two possibilities: - a separate backend component probably a daemon , that constantly polls and gathers the required data. this would run on a cron-like schedule, or possibly subscribe to message queues where possible. no user interaction is needed to gather information. - information is gathered when a user logs into the delivery dashboard, presumably by the web backend code. this may be largely a question for release management, and what their expectations are. eg: are they expecting notifications when things are complete, or just a central place to look for updates. feel free to add more possibilies or clarify the above!
