 URL : "https://github.com/jacobwb/hashover-next/issues/197" TITLE : how to enable external use BODY : hashover no longer works on my blog. i just switched to a different hosting company and also updated my ghost blog script, so maybe that has something to do with it because it works perfectly fine with my old website using the old ghost script. in /home/earthapp/public_html/content/themes/journal/partials/comments.hbs, i have the code: <script type= text/javascript src= /hashover/hashover.js ></script> <noscript>you must have javascript enabled to use the comments.</noscript> and for example, it would usually show up if you click write a comment on http://earthappl.es/death-angel/. http://earthappl.es/hashover/hashover.js seems to load fine, but http://earthappl.es/hashover/scripts/hashover-javascript.php doesn't 404 error . all directories are set to 0755. everything else is 0644. i only edited the settings.php and the theme, but i also tried re-installing the script totally fresh without any of the old stuff from my old website and it still doesn't work. but it does work if i host the hashover script on a subdomain and just use this code on /home/earthapp/public_html/content/themes/journal/partials/comments.hbs: <script type= text/javascript src= http://grim.earthappl.es/hashover/hashover.js ></script> <noscript>you must have javascript enabled to use the comments.</noscript> it will just say something like external use is not allowed , but at least something shows up! since it seems more simple than trying to dig through the ghost script i don't know , how can i enable external use?
