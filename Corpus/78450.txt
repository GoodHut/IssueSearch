 URL : "https://github.com/therecipe/qt/issues/440" TITLE : projects with a makefile BODY : i'm trying to use these bindings in a project which uses a makefile as a wrapper for calling go build - out of convenience and to better deal with git submodules. calling qtdeploy build desktop from the makefile works and builds just fine, but afterwards my makefile gets deleted. i guess it's used and overwritten in the process of deploying. could you generate and run those files in a separate build directory or try to pick an alternative makefile names for qtdeploy, so these bindings don't tamper with regular project data? keep up the great work!
