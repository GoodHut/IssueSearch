 URL : "https://github.com/gitburn/gitburn/issues/90" TITLE : packaging the app BODY : our logic for packaging the app is less than ideal. this is due to the combination of a few things: 1. we want to run the packaged app itself for development. this is because 1 we use a url protocol, which means munging the info.plist , 2 some behaviors differ between electron-prebuilt and a packaged app e.g., default menu bar , 3 we gotta see that sweet icon. 1. we don't want to include most of our dev dependencies in the built development app because this means copying lots of small files, which slows build time way down, especially on oses with shitty file systems e.g., windows . 1. but we do want to include a few of our dev dependencies e.g., for hot module replacement . to bring all these pieces together, we currently have a special debugdependencies section in our package.json : https://github.com/gitburn/gitburn/blob/master/package.json l42. these are the dev dependencies we want in dev builds. then at build time we copy our package.json , munge it a bit https://github.com/gitburn/gitburn/blob/master/script/build l110 , and install those modules into a new directory. this whole arrangement works, but it has some downsides: 1. it's complex. we have to invent this debugdependencies thing and munge the package.json. 1. it doesn't really support shrink-wrapping. we'd have to do more custom work.
