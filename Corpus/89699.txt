BODY : i got a free hug from deque. wow. those people are smart. in the axe hackathon at deque we spent some time critiquing eureka 2.0. while i ❤️ aspects of the focusable contextual row appearing below focused media items, it breaks the table structure because that context row does not follow the tabular data structure defined by the <thead> . oh no! ! http://j4p.us/2i2m2k0t342q/screen%20shot%202017-03-04%20at%2011.56.12%20am.png some other solutions we discussed would be for the table to have an actions column and each context menu goes in the actions column. maybe there is an expandable 'expands actions for turtle.jpg' button that then opens the menus for expand, choose, rename, delete, whatever.
