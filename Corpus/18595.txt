 URL : "https://github.com/atsb/RL_M/issues/53" TITLE : translations text BODY : i have been aware now for some time of the popularity of larn outside of english-speaking countries, actually quite a few russian sites were following my larn-snapshot releases yes i noticed . so what i'm doing is taking all the hardcoded text, putting them into a new file as const chars and passing them to lprcat wrapped in a define if defined english, russian, french etc.. and will compile the correct string. i dislike gettext. it would be great if some players who would like to play larn in their native language could send native text strings in so i can add it into larn. i'm not expecting it to be fast, but it would be a nice addition.
