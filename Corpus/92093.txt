 URL : "https://github.com/kelektiv/node-uuid/issues/210" TITLE : uuid/v4 issue with enzyme BODY : this is a heads up about https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme/issues/1020. is it possible that uuid/v4 is not exported in a way that can be handled by all loaders? it seems like modern tooling should handle import uuidv4 from 'uuid/v4' as it is in enzyme@2.9.1 https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme/blob/v2.9.1/src/utils.js l5 but that failed for us https://github.com/plangrid/enzyme/pull/3 whereas import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid' works. any idea why?
