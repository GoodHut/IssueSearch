 URL : "https://github.com/MIT-LCP/wfdb-python/issues/78" TITLE : annotations not showing? BODY : ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17966146/31156239-3d58d7a2-a881-11e7-91e3-f95fc1dc6cc0.png i downloaded record 208 from the database, and this record is known to contain many pvcs annotated as v . the signals above contain many pvcs but have no v annotations - only \ s are shown. this seems to happen for any record / sample period i try. the only annotations that show are s. not sure if i'm reading in the annotations incorrectly or an issue elsewhere.
