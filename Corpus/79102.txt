 URL : "https://github.com/Querijn/BottyMcBotface/issues/8" TITLE : rewrite bot & merge heim BODY : this is a discussion to see the thoughts on rewriting botty. the main argument right now is that some donâ€™t know typescript preventing contributions from users. if we wrote it in js or python i feel there would be a larger contribution base. i also want to discuss ideas of merging botty and heimerdinger.
