 URL : "https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/issues/8545" TITLE : run cqs in parallel BODY : feature request __system info:__ influx 1.2.4, linux 4.1.19_1, 4x e5-2660 v4 @ 2.00ghz 56 cores in total , 256gb ram, 2tb ssd raid 10 8 disks __current behavior:__ we run a 1.6m cardinality influxdb with ~500 cqs. we cannot add any further cqs as they're processed sequentially and overall runtime must be below the lowest cq interval of 5m . we already tried to use kapacitor batch tasks to offload expensive cqs. but enabling kapacitor with two subscriptions introduces an 3x increase in memory consumption and 2x increase in cpu without having any enabled kapacitor task. __desired behavior:__ introduce parallelization. i've seen the pro and cons regarding parallelism https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/issues/8005 issuecomment-298076222. i think on the long term there is no way around it as this will become a limiting factor for larger setups. this might requires the introduction of a dependency tree similar to systemd.
