 URL : "https://github.com/mpay24/mpay24-php/issues/40" TITLE : psr1 & psr2 BODY : having the psr-4 branch almost ready rises the question about psr1 http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/ basic coding standard & psr2 http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/ coding style guide some of the rules are already realized some are not. from psr 1: - class names must be declared in studlycaps . - method names must be declared in camelcase for psr 2 the are also a view things that could be improved: - code must use 4 spaces for indenting, not tabs. - visibility must be declared on all properties and methods; - opening parentheses for control structures must not have a space after them, and closing parentheses for control structures must not have a space before. most of this can be done with the ide and on keystrok, but the names for classes in studlycaps and method names in camelcase needs manuel changes. my suggestion is to change it! if you have any concerns about the mpay24 class than we could build a wrapper class with this name and declarer it as deprecated, and remove it in the next major update this gives you also time to update the documentation accordingly a good solution imho would be: namspace = mpay24 class names are: mpay24 or better mpay24soap mpay24config mpay24flexlink mpay24sdk order or better mpay24order every other class name is alright all methods will be changed to camelcase if you agree with it, i could create a pull request. in the wiki or somewhere else you could do a article where you declare that you code must be written according to dose psr1 & psr2 & prs4 standards, this makes it easier for every one ho wants to contribute.
