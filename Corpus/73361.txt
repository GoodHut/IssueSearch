 URL : "https://github.com/xeleration/memerator/issues/74" TITLE : create a code of conduct BODY : this is something good to have. one good reason is that it can give us guidelines on how we are supposed to use this repo. it can have information like who is supposed to merge to pr's, what labels are supposed to be on issues, when to assign a person to an issue, who is allowed to add labels, we have to add a comment for every line of code, and much more. what do you think, @pipe-to-grep?
