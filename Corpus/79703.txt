 URL : "https://github.com/libDirectional/libDirectional/issues/3" TITLE : square operation missing BODY : hi ! from the random sampling from the watson distribution paper, it seems that u_1 term in step 3 is squared, while your implementation just uses u_1 https://github.com/libdirectional/libdirectional/blob/master/lib/distributions/hypersphere/watsondistribution.m l96 as is. is this a typo in your implementation or in the paper ? cheers, david
