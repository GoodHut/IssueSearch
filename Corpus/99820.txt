BODY : for some reason when i run this project i get the errors: error: no audio callback defined. make sure you set settings->render to point to your audio callbackerror: unable to initialise audio it only started appearing after i uploaded the latest bela update patch. prior to the update i was able to run this program. i saw in the bela source that this error could occur if you attempt to run more than one project at a time, but i don't get the error from any other projects. any idea what may be causing the problem?
