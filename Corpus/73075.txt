 URL : "https://github.com/Alicechung/MACS30200proj/issues/2" TITLE : comments on poster -- dp BODY : the poster is nicely formatted and looks very pleasing. the first thing i noticed is that there are too many words. you have extensively introduced your paper in “background” section and “specific aim”. i think data section is not needed. instead, you could have provided some descriptive statistics of some key variables and produce some plots. you have two measurement section, which i do not know why you put them there. are those your independent variables? plots look nice but the labels are not very readable. i could not tell which variables are on the x-axis and y-axis. in “estimated model coefficient” section, i think presenting a regression table would definitely be better than giving a plot of coefficients. it makes the readers know what coefficients are statistically significant and which are not. not very readable.
