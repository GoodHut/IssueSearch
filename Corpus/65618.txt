 URL : "https://github.com/mojohaus/nbm-maven-plugin/issues/28" TITLE : java 9 and 32 vs 64 bit BODY : the plugin's method for determining if the jvm is 32 bit or 64 bit will not work with java 9. in files runnetbeansmojo.java and runplatformappmojo.java the method is based on testing for the existence of jre\\lib\\amd64\\jvm.cfg this will for sure not work with java 9. btw : the same code is duplicated between the two mojos, so maybe this is an opportunity for a little bit of refactoring?
