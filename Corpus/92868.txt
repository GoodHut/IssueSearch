 URL : "https://github.com/fethica/PHP-Login/issues/67" TITLE : ability to secure folders? BODY : is there a good way to secure folders within the web root directory please? for example, rpi web cam for which i'm using php-login with has a /webroot/media folder that is exposed to browsing and direct media downloading when given the right url. i've locked the folder down by using a simple php redirect within index.php using the one liner below, but i'm not sure how to protect media from direct downloads. <?php header location:../ ; ?> is this something you've considered for the new version or is there a way for me to lock it down before that's released? thanks.
