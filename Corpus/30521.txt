 URL : "https://github.com/osvathrobi/node-ibus/issues/3" TITLE : porting to node-red BODY : hello there, also x3 owner hacking around in the ibus. awesome project. great to get me started! thanks. i was wondering if you thought about putting this into a node-red node? i have attempted to package it per instructions here: https://nodered.org/docs/creating-nodes/first-node but my js isnt good enough :/ it would be really cool to have a node that spits out the ibus data and a node to send ibus data. the graphical interface of nodered will make it easy for non js superuser like yourself to implement their functions. this is as far as i got in making my own node haha. https://i.imgur.com/hxwewqn.jpg
