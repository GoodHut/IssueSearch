 URL : "https://github.com/miteshpithadiya/SearchableSpinner/issues/66" TITLE : default search query BODY : hi! is it possible to define a default search or to keep last search? i would like to show the last query of user, something like keep filtered . maybe you're searching for a person with the same name but different surname so you wouldn't need to write the name again. thanks in advance!
