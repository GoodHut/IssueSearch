 URL : "https://github.com/Origen-SDK/origen/issues/178" TITLE : quick question on limits BODY : i would like folks to weigh in on whether a limitset :min, :typ, :max is a class that would reside in the namespace of origen::specs::spec or if a limitset can be defined outside of a specification? i am asking for an urgent response as this will help clarify my initial origen::specs rfc. i have a forked version of the specs module that has limit sets working but need this answer before sharing on github. thx
