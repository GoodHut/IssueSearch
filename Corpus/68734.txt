 URL : "https://github.com/Philippe734/Simple.NFS.GUI/issues/4" TITLE : setup comment and query BODY : hello i know it sounds obvious but worth mentioning in your instructions after setting up the repository connection to download the package use: $ sudo apt-get simple-nfs-gui the precise name of the application confused me. unfortunately i still then had problems running the application, i tried to launch it from the gui and it said that it needs root access. i couldnâ€™t easily work out how to launch the app from the gui or from a command shell as root. possibly a newbie question but how do you launch it as sudo/root. if you can please include in your instructions. thanks.
