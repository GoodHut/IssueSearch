 URL : "https://github.com/serghey-rodin/vesta/issues/1309" TITLE : domain settings injection BODY : hello, i found that it is possible to add malicious characters into domain configuration. this results in unusable domain administration and i had a hard time finding where it stores data, so i can recover it : operating system os/version : debian 8 vestacp version: idk where to find version number steps to reproduce: - add domain - click edit - into alliases enter whatever you want, e.g. test' single quote is needed to break it this will break application, because it goes right into settings in raw form it should be validated if it's really domain name . also it can be used to craft custom settings yes, i know that almost everything you can change in panel . it take me some time to find location where it stores this data: /usr/local/vesta/data/users/admin/web.conf btw, vesta panel is __awesome__
