 URL : "https://github.com/django/channels/issues/729" TITLE : multiplexer send hijacking BODY : currently, the multiplexer hijacks the consumer's send method https://github.com/django/channels/blob/master/channels/generic/websockets.py l263 and replaces it with its own exception-raising method. this seems to create two issues: - consumers have to be aware of their context i.e. whether to use the multiplexer kwarg or call self.send - consumers lose any custom behavior in their own send method is there an issue with the lifecycle of consumers that we cannot either: - set consumer.send = multiplexer.send to address just the first point or - refactor consumers with a parameter e.g. channel that defaults to message.reply_channel but could be replaced by multiplexer without losing any consumer-specific send logic.
