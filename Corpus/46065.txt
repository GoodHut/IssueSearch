 URL : "https://github.com/shd101wyy/markdown-preview-enhanced/issues/604" TITLE : latex displayed twice BODY : i created the following document with mpe, which i exported to html by right-clicking on the preview. it looks great on my laptop, but when i upload it to the server, the equations are displayed wrong: https://web.njit.edu/~goodman/math222/matlab1.html following the equation $\frac{dx}{dt}=x-x^3$, the raw latex for the equation appears. later on, i used \$\to\$ to draw an arrow in my text and the arrow appears twice.
