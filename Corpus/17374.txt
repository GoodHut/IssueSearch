 URL : "https://github.com/veromary/veromary.github.io/issues/2" TITLE : page build failed BODY : it built on my home desktop. i just added a link to the new advent calendar. i accidentally added a blank line to rotate.css but surely that wouldn't affect it. probably something that's become obsolete in the year or so since i last pushed any changes. the new remote theme thing sounds good if i can get it to work. would that build at home though, or only on github pages?
