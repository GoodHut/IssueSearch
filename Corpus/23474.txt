 URL : "https://github.com/Cxbx-Reloaded/Cxbx-Reloaded/issues/358" TITLE : port to direct3d 9 BODY : currently, cxbx is using direct3d 8, which imposes a few limitations that are lifted with direct3d 9. dxbx here on github already contains much of the required changes, so we can start by porting that back to cxbx see https://github.com/patrickvl/dxbx/search?utf8=%e2%9c%93&q=dxbx_use_d3d9&type= for all related delphi code . because a port like this is going to be a lot of work, it's wise to do this using either a compiler define as a switch, or using a runtime setting either via lots of if statements, or the right way, by moving all drawing code towards a c++ class . area's that will be hit: texture formats calls to drawing api's conversions of d3d resource buffers shaders
