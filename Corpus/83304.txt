 URL : "https://github.com/cytopia/devilbox/issues/122" TITLE : can not install npm grunt BODY : hi, i have just update following https://github.com/cytopia/devilbox/blob/master/docs/update.md because i was expecting more locale but localedef -i fr_fr -f utf-8 fr_fr.utf-8 and localedef -i es_es -f utf-8 es_es.utf-8 are still missing ... anyway that is another topic . i notice that ./shell.sh has replaced ./bash.sh and ./root_bash.sh on master but while before i could do ./root_bash.sh npm install -g grunt and in another ./bash.sh session do grunt <scriptname> now i always get grunt: command not found either in devilbox or root user how to reproduce: sudo su - npm install -g grunt npm install -g grunt-cli seems installing fine into /usr/local/src/node-v6.11.2-linux-x64/lib/node_modules/grunt/bin/grunt but typing grunt still produce error message i have to rollback to tag 0.11
