 URL : "https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/Protocols/issues/1" TITLE : help with basic command BODY : i am trying to communicate from a compactrio to a serial basestation and in turn to a node. i have tried to assemble a basic ping command but got no response when i tried it. the command i sent in hex was: ac04 0013 0900 0200 027f 7ff4 90f2 22 do you have an example of a command i could send that should definitely get a response so i know that all of my hardware is setup correctly. did i construct the command above correctly or did i miss something? i am not sure i did the checksum properly.
