 URL : "https://github.com/mzomparelli/zVirtualDesktop/issues/147" TITLE : crash when opening BODY : this happens about 50% of the time when i open the program. after it opens successfully though, it works fine. here is the debug error message visual studio gave me: an unhandled exception of type 'system.invalidoperationexception' occurred in mscorlib.dll hashtable insert failed. load factor too high. the most common cause is multiple threads writing to the hashtable simultaneously.
