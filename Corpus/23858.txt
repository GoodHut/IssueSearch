 URL : "https://github.com/codemusltd/flickerApp/issues/2" TITLE : repo cannot be run BODY : if i were another developer cloning this repository, i won't be able to run this project. you have two options to rectify this, make a barebones react app: https://medium.com/@andy.neale/learning-react-setting-up-a-minimal-react-development-environment-fcd17fc7dee1 or use create-react-app: https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app second option has more 'moving parts' but would be less frustrating to setup.
