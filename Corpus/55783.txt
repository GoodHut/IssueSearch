 URL : "https://github.com/meyera/riskscorer/issues/8" TITLE : link to other packages BODY : this issue is part of this joss review https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/19 i have two remarks here: you mention it is the first package to offer such functionality. however, if there are packages that have functionalities that might complement this one, e.g. from the cran task view clinical trials https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/clinicaltrials.html could you mention them, e.g. in the readme or vignette? if you end up submitting the package to cran which as i said in another issue i'd recommend because it makes your package easier to find, trust and install , maybe it could be added to a relevant cran task view?
