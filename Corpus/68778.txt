 URL : "https://github.com/AlexZeitler/expressjs-dynamic-runtime-routing/issues/1" TITLE : should this still work? BODY : i have tried to use this example to dynamically load a module with news routes during a file read operation in order to create a simple plugin system for my node.js app, however i cannot get the routes to remain active in the application. unless i call require in the global scope, the app forgets about the routes as soon as the scope it was called in is gone. any suggestions? thanks.
