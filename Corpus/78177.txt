 URL : "https://github.com/quicklisp/quicklisp-projects/issues/1295" TITLE : please add simple-routes BODY : simple-routes provides a method for simple, centralized http routing on top of hunchentoot. when used in conjunction with hunchentoot this library takes priority over the default hunchentoot routing system but does not replace it. if simple-routes does not match a handler to a given request, it will fall back to hunchentoot's other url routing methods easy-handler, then the default static file service . author: currell berry source: https://gitlab.com/vancan1ty/simple-routes.git documentation: https://gitlab.com/vancan1ty/simple-routes/blob/master/readme.md
