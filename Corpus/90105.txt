 URL : "https://github.com/EndlessCodeGroup/RPGInventory/issues/50" TITLE : rpginventory with openinv BODY : unsure how to go about this, and getting it to work. using openinv or any kind of inventory checker for example , would not work with this plugin. it sees the original inventory of the player, but anything the player is wearing: such as pet, backpack, and armor/weapons, were not visible. wondering if there is a way to allow openinv see the special inventory of rpginventory? please & thank you.
