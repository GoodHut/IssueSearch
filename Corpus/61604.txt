 URL : "https://github.com/Brok-Bucholtz/P4-Beta/issues/1" TITLE : beta feedback - rahulhp BODY : - text to word ids clarify this point the sentences have already been converted to lowercase. in the text to word ids section - encoding clarify that lstmcell is to be used based on training review and that dropout is optional based on hints in project review page in the encoding section. use tf.contrib.rnn.lstmcell as the building block of the network. optionally, implement dropout with keep probability keep_prob. - positional vs keyword arguments given the huge number of arguments every function has in tensorflow, i'd like to add a note in the beginning promoting the usage of positional arguments instead of keyword arguments for clarity and to avoid mistakes.
