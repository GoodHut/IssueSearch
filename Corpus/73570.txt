 URL : "https://github.com/astropy/halotools/issues/707" TITLE : crossmatch bug/doc error BODY : the utility function crossmatch x,y states that it finds where the elements of x appear in the array y , including repeats. in fact, it finds where the elements of x appear in the sorted array y , including repeats. at the least, the first line of the doc string should indicate this. i think it would be better if it in fact did what it says currently. any thoughts @aphearin?
