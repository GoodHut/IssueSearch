 URL : "https://github.com/Procrat/eva/issues/1" TITLE : fuzzy time support BODY : at the moment, a precise time has to be given. but i seldom know the precise time a task will require or what the precise deadline is. so maybe it would be a good idea to think about if and how to support fuzzy times? for example when a deadline is soon it could be + 2 days. or when a task is short it could require around 10 minutes. i eva could even ask you some questions, like is this task earlier due than task x? . and with a clever logarithmic search she could make a guess about when she should schedule that particular task. this could of course also be used for the task length and priority. to be able to schedule tasks, we only need an ordering between the tasks, not real values. right?
