 URL : "https://github.com/contao/core/issues/8772" TITLE : 3.5.28: problem with ssl BODY : hi there, contao: 3.5.28 php 7 had some problems when hoster activated ssl -> page delivered mixed content https & http . hoster has been contacted and their solution was to change line 319 in system/core/library/contao/environment.php return $_server 'ssl_session_id' || $_server 'https' == 'on' || $_server 'https' == 1 ; was changed to return $_server 'ssl_session_id' || $_server 'https' == 'on' || $_server 'https' == 1 ; so they only changed the value on to on . our workaround - as suggested here https://community.contao.org/de/showthread.php?67794-problem-mit-ssl : in system/config/initconfig.php: if $_server 'https' == 'on' { $_server 'https' = 'on'; }
