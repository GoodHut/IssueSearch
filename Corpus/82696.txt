BODY : hi, i have a neo4j dataset i'd like to play with within alchemy, do you have any guidelines to do that...the same way linkurious does for example ? i've seen that alchemy supports graphjson format, but it does not mention how to easily get this out of neo4j for example, from a simple command line. like i have manually built a quite consequent dataset, i need something pretty automatic ;-p thank you in advance for your help, i really would like to see my datas displayed with your library ! https://github.com/adriens/neo4j-cuisine-nicoise kind regards, adrien
