 URL : "https://github.com/terba/slimmer/issues/23" TITLE : additional scroll styles BODY : can you please implement also additional different ways of displaying artist, title or album information longer than the screen width? scrolling letter by letter doesn't look too nice on slow displays. another way would be to simply wrap the text in chunks smaller than the screen width and flip through the lines.
