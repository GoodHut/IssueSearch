 URL : "https://github.com/vmware/tern/issues/4" TITLE : 'from scratch' check BODY : tern checks for any imports in a dockerfile by checking for the from directive and then attempting to pull the specified image from dockerhub. but 'scratch' is just a placeholder to say 'there is no import'. at the minimum, do not attempt to pull from dockerhub if the word 'scratch' is in the from string.
