 URL : "https://github.com/BTMorton/angular2-grid/issues/215" TITLE : remove items from grid BODY : as far as i see there is no public api to remove items. https://github.com/btmorton/angular2-grid/blob/master/src/directives/nggrid.ts l354 presents a public removeitem function, however i see no way to access it from the template or component using the directive especially with removeitem requiring a reference to the griditem . removing items from the bound item collection using items.splice x, 1 causes really weird behaviour items are being duplicated, wrong item is deleted, ... . on side note: if the direcives used @directive { selector=' nggrid ', exportas='nggrid' } and @directive { selector=' nggriditem ', exportas='nggriditem' } we could probably at least do something like <div grid nggrid = gridconfig > <div griditem ngfor= let item of itemconfig; let i = index nggriditem = itemconfig i > <button click = grid.removeitem griditem >remove</button> </div> </div>
