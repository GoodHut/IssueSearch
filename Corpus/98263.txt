 URL : "https://github.com/DotPDev/DotPWeb/issues/99" TITLE : indention and line spacing BODY : yo, williamstanley! not sure what machine and editor you're using, but i saw some indentation mismatches. an easy way to fix some of this is to use an ide like atom, set your settings to 4 spaces per tab, and then on any given file, select all, go to view > lines > autoindent. that normallys trues up 95% of indention/tab issues. also, i don't know if its broken or turned off but jshint should be running when you grunt build and informing you of syntax errors including indents .
