 URL : "https://github.com/muammar/mkchromecast/issues/94" TITLE : problems on ubuntu BODY : hi muammar. thanks for the hard work you have put into mkchromecast. i have a problem streaming to cca from kubuntu 16.04 lts. i installed mkchromecast as detailed here, with all the dependencies, but it doesn't work very well. i can stream to cca using the default settings of backend=parec / bitrate=192 / sample rate=44100 but i'd like to use higher resolution streams if available. if i try to run with backend=ffmpeg, flac and higher bitrate and sample rate, then i hear the bell sound as cca connects and my pulseaudio volume controller shows an audio signal the vu meter moves satisfactorily and i can select mkchromecast as an output, but there is no sound output. in fact there is no outward network traffic showing, when i use the default settings i see steady outward network traffic. launching mkchromecast with the -t option and opening the preferences dialogue shows ffmpeg avconv and parec as available backends, flac as a codec, bitrates up to 500 and sample rates up to 192k any ideas? thanks
