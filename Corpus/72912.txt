 URL : "https://github.com/QutBioacoustics/baw-client/issues/303" TITLE : citizen science examples BODY : citizen science examples layout needs to be improved. - show examples all the time, since otherwise there is an empty space where they go, making the page seem wonky - make overflow scrolling for very wide long duration example annotations. otherwise the whole page needs to scroll which looks bad. - arrows to navigate between headings are not aligned
