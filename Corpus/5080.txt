 URL : "https://github.com/fsbahman/apidoc-swagger/issues/34" TITLE : length is null BODY : hello, i hope this is a bug. var matches = pattern.exec url ; and we want to use the matches.length but sometimes we got a null because the matches hasn't lenght. if you have time please check this in apidoctoswagger.js file. so i corrected myself locally: if matches { for var j = 1; j < matches.length; j++ { var key = matches j .substr 1 ; url = url.replace matches j , { + key + } ; pathkeys.push key ; } }
