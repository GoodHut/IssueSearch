 URL : "https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop/issues/6911" TITLE : cleanup ledger tests BODY : /cc @willy-b @bsclifton @mrose17 ledger payments advanced panel tests are failing consistently so i had to disable them. please cleanup as soon as possible. i would have reverted instead but there were too many dependent commits after it. ledger tests are failing consistently so i reverted just the tests for now. i also noticed some problems with the tests so the changesets probably shoudln't have landed. some notes that i noticed too about these tests: - .pause 1000 pauses shouldn't be used at all, instead waitfor some event. if you need to add a new custom waitfor you can add it in test/lib/brave.js - some things are being attached to context and then used in later it calls, each test should be able to be run independently though so some of that logic should go in a before call instead. e.g. context.recoveryfilepathname . you should be able to do npm run test -- --grep= shows an error popover if one recovery key is missing - all tests should pass locally and on travis consistently. i'd prefer not landing any more ledger things until this is cleaned up, thanks.
