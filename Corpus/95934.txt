 URL : "https://github.com/mattn/vim-fz/issues/15" TITLE : doesn't work in vim on mac BODY : running directly on command line seems to work but not inside vim. running inside neovim on mac seems to work. haven't tried on linux yet. i'm guessing vim parses command line differently when running in terminal? <img width= 931 alt= screen shot 2017-08-21 at 11 20 19 pm src= https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/287744/29551393-5a6bc150-86c7-11e7-9135-891ad00f507f.png > should we be using arrays instead of string for cmds? let job = job_start /bin/sh , -c , echo hello . this is what i do in async.vim https://github.com/prabirshrestha/async.vim to have maximum compatibility between vim and neovim as well as mac, linux and windows.
