 URL : "https://github.com/TradingPal/react-native-highcharts/issues/43" TITLE : no data on first load BODY : i am finding a weird issue where the first time i install my app on the device and view a chart, the chart shows no datapoints. the legend, title, and axis are all visible but no datapoints are visible. if i close and restart my app, then it works fine. uninstalling and reinstalling my app will cause the issue to return on the first run until i close and restart the app. any ideas what could be the issue?
