 URL : "https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxFaceTracker/issues/143" TITLE : playing movie in faceosc BODY : @danomatika i'm very out of here with no programming experience other than pure data and max. however, i'm trying to understand the instructions for playing movies within faceosc. in the read me it says put the movie file in your home folder and set it in the movie <filename> tag with the full path to the movie aka: /users/youruseraccountname/yourmovie.mov change the source <usecamera> tag to 0 to use the movie as input. also check the other movie settings volume, speed . but i'm not exactly sure what the home folder is, or what exactly a full path to it is. i'm creating an interactive computer music system that incorporates faceosc and the ability to play movies within in would be a great help. thanks, nathan sepulveda
