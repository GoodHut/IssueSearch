BODY : i am using the assistant on a raspberry pi - with the google aiy kit and a raspberry pi connected to the internet via an isp. if i say ok google - good morning i get the usual greeting, then the weather, then details of my commute. of course i am sitting in my own home - and if i ask the assistant where i live it has my address pinned down from my google account the commute information is always wrong - it must be based upon my derived location using some kind of geolocation software. the distance i have to commute varies from 7 to 16 miles. telling me what my commute to my home is - when i am sitting in my home is a farce. to make matters worse i cannot find any way to tell the assistant to stop telling me about my non existent commute - help it is driving me bananas.
