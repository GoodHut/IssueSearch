BODY : is it possible that there is a small typo in lesson_05_scheduling_01.cpp in the section on parallelizing across tiles, specifically in the equivalent c code ? the halide code is processing an 8x8 picture, but in the c-code, it seems like a 16x16 picture is being processed. might be a dumb question but i only just got started on the tutorials so i wanna make sure that i got this right :
