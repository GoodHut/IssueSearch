 URL : "https://github.com/hayleefay/MACS30200proj/issues/1" TITLE : comments on data/methods BODY : the histograms look very nice. good data section and summary statistics tables. remove the rectangle around the migration flow equation. use separate sections for the results and methods. overall, this looks good and it seems like you are on the right track.
