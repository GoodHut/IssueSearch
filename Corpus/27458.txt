 URL : "https://github.com/ardumont/org2jekyll/issues/50" TITLE : dealing with images BODY : hi, i'm toying around with jekyll / org2jekyll but i’ve not been able to publish images easily from orgmode. the only way i managed to publish images is by placing all of them in top level directory of jekyll and put relative paths in orgmode like this : ../../../../../images/test_r.png i strongly guess i’ve missed something somewhere doing like this i can't see the images from orgmode, which is annoying . would you mind explaining the correct way to deal with images in terms of paths ? thanks.
