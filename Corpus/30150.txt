 URL : "https://github.com/flagrow/bazaar/issues/81" TITLE : notify about events BODY : i've been considering other uses to the dashboard on flagrow.io. one of these is the ability to show in realtime when new events happen. those i could think of: - new user registered, in combination with total count - new discussion created, in combination with total number of discussions - new post on discussion, in combination with total number of posts the flow of this would be quite easy. bazaar would listen to the respective flarum events and send this information to flagrow.io. flagrow.io would receive this via api, persist it and broadcast the information on a websocket implementation pusher is a native implementation in laravel . the result would be a realtime dashboard giving registered users realtime insight about their bazaar enabled flarum installations.
