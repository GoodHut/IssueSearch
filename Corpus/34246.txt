 URL : "https://github.com/hyt47/SteamDesktopAuthenticator-Mod-47/issues/28" TITLE : can't confirm trades BODY : i was using latest version of sda and up until yesterday everything was working fine. then all of a sudden i can't confirm trades - just get blank white window. tried forcing-refresh, logging in, removing and installing sda again with backing up and copying .mafile , restarting computer - nothing helps. then i stumbled upon this program, but after deleting sda, installing mod 47, importing old mafile - i still have this problem. authenticator part works ok - codes displayed and working, i can log in steam client and through browser just fine, but i can't confirm any trades. force session refresh returns error failed... try again soon . login again - error logging in: steam returned generalfailure. and again - restarting program and computer doesn't help. is there any way to fix it without disabling authenticator and re-enablimg it? i don't want to have a hold for 15 days...
