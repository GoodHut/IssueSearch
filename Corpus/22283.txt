 URL : "https://github.com/topcoderinc/pxCore/issues/90" TITLE : isolate js changes BODY : we are going to create two pull requests: 1. just the js changes, which can apply to both node and duktape. 2. the full duktape integration this way we can quickly apply the js changes that shouldn't affect the node implementation and will integrate the duktape code later. this ticket will track moving just the js changes over to the duktape_js_changes branch the js changes should include anything that we can change that won't affect how the node codebase functions. this includes: dropping the => notation changes to the import / require statements changes in scene.1.js for the dynamic functions this will include the changes to these files: editbox.js browser.js scene.1.js scenemoduleloader.js xmodule.js argprocessor.js the goal is to have the src and rcvrcore_duktape folder only include js files that have drastically changed, instead of all files.
