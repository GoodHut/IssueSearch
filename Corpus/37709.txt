 URL : "https://github.com/silexlabs/Silex/issues/551" TITLE : mobile view on ipad? BODY : my full site loads correctly on an ipad2 and ipad air 2 as long as it's horizontal. turn the ipad to vertical, and it's fine. when you refresh the browser however, the mobile site loads. turn horizontally again, stays mobile, as expected. it seems to me the 480 px breakpoint falls below the ipad's 768 px vertical size, correct? my site is here: http://soundservice.us when you get a chance. thanks again!
