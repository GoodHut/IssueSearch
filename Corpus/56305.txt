 URL : "https://github.com/OrKoN/npm-link-shared/issues/13" TITLE : more declarative style BODY : hey there! i developed this over the last week: https://github.com/oresoftware/npm-link-up i just discovered your project now. cool - i wonder if there are others. one thing i like about my project, is that the tool will search for the packages by name. all you need is a config file with the list of dependency names, and npmlinkup will search for them on the filesystem. so if you happen to move projects around by chance, it will still work fine. also, we probably have slightly different algorithms. i tested mine and it should manage circular dependencies just fine. still have to write more tests for npmlinkup though.
