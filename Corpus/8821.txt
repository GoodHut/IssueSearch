 URL : "https://github.com/shadow-1/yi-hack-v3/issues/32" TITLE : save to sd card BODY : hello, first off, thank you for taking the time to create the hack and to keep updating it. it's really appreciated. i successfully hacked two 360 dome cameras black and they work fine when viewing real-time. however, i noticed that the cameras are not saving anything to the sd card. normally, with older model cameras as my reference, the cameras will keep a rolling recording on the sd card, so you can track back as needed. is there something i need to configure in regards to the hack to get this working? thanks.
