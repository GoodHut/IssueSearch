 URL : "https://github.com/yash101/CircuitLang/issues/1" TITLE : import code files BODY : writing entire programs within a single code file is rather impractical for maintainability and readability. if you're interested in this language, please give me ideas on how to implement this! here are a few problems that need to be considered to begin: 1. with an extremely large program, how should two functions with the same names across functions be handled? should there be a syntactical option to expose or hide functions from the global scope? hidden functions would have their called names automatically mangled. 2. should it be possible to import a file more than once? i can't see the point of this, but perhaps there is a reason to allow it.
