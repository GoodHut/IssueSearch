 URL : "https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/issues/157" TITLE : bors blocker command BODY : this is a nice-to-have feature request. even under the stern bors guidance, the master can still be broken if something external to the build itself changes for example, the build uses the nightly compiler, and the next nightly breaks things . in such a case, several pull requests may fail to pass the checks. so you have to send a pull requests that fixes master, wait for it to be merged and then manually retry all the pending ones. it would be great to say something like bors retry all and have the bot do this automatically. perhaps this can be extended even to something like bors blocker which means that until this pr is merged, no other should be in the queue, and that all r+ should be buffered until the blocker is resolved.
