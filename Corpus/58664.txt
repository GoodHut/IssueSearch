 URL : "https://github.com/fs-webcomponents/fs-elements/issues/15" TITLE : standard ajax handling BODY : most components need to load data from the api. we already have fs-behavior https://github.com/fs-webcomponents/fs-behavior which helps with this by making it easy to access the sdk client. perhaps we should augment to help with other common tasks such as tracking loading status. perhaps we need our own version of iron-ajax https://www.webcomponents.org/element/polymerelements/iron-ajax . then, instead of using a behavior or mixin which is all or nothing, components can choose, via data binding and other integration points, how much of the behavior they get. it would replace most instances of fs-client. fs-ajax or fs-request?
