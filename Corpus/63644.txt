 URL : "https://github.com/bvieth/powsimR/issues/2" TITLE : error building vignette BODY : hi beate, installing powsimr using devtools::install_github bvieth/powsimr , build_vignettes = true results in an error due to its inability to build the vignette. this is rectified if build_vignettes=false, however i can't seem to find a complete vignette for powsimr at least not on your github account or through the package . it would be great to have access to this. best, hania
