 URL : "https://github.com/ISA-tools/ISAcreator/issues/321" TITLE : update wiki documentation BODY : the wiki documentation hasn't been updated for a long time. i've made a start, but would be good to update as much as possible to help people onboard with isacreator since there still is a decent amount of interest and support requests.
