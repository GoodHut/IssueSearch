 URL : "https://github.com/shevron/ext-jsonreader/issues/7" TITLE : php 7 support BODY : this extension is literally the fastest thing i've found for streaming parsing of huge json files or streaming json data, such as from elasticsearch. we're using it for five major processes at my day job. now that php 7 is mainstream, why not update this extension to php 7 and put it on pecl so people can find it easily? the closest thing to it it s native php, and about 1/10th as fast.
