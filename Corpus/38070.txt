 URL : "https://github.com/tiangolo/uwsgi-nginx-flask-docker/issues/16" TITLE : no support for https BODY : i'm trying to figure this out now. i would prefer not to check the keys into my repo or bake them into the image. as it stands, it looks like i'll have to overwrite entrypoint.sh so that it writes a different nginx.conf that points to a cert and a key in a volume that runner of the container can create. i'm pretty new to docker though... any recommendations?
