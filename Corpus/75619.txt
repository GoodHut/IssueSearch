BODY : --- please use this template, and delete everything above this line before submitting your issue --- description documentation request: it would be great if you could provide instructions on how to run the examples. expected behavior since i couldn't find any instructions, i tried to run the modalsample example as follows: - copy package.json from the demo project generated using react-vr init into the modalsample directory - run npm install in that directory to install the requirements - run npm start the expected behavior would be that it would work like that. actual behavior when running npm start , it starts up, but when i load it in the browser, i get: loading dependency graph, done. bundling vr/client.js analysing...error: unrecognized platform: vr at dependencygraph._getrequestplatform /users/raf/vr/react-vr/examples/modelsample/node_modules/react-native/packager/src/node-haste/index.js:334:13 at load.then /users/raf/vr/react-vr/examples/modelsample/node_modules/react-native/packager/src/node-haste/index.js:294:23 at process._tickcallback internal/process/next_tick.js:103:7 reproduction - copy package.json from the demo project generated using react-vr init into the modalsample directory - run npm install in that directory to install the requirements - run npm start - open browser at http://localhost:8081/vr/ solution would be great if you could provide some simple instructions on how to run the examples! additional information react vr version: fill this out: both react-vr and react-vr-web operating system: macos graphics card: / browser: chrome 57 vr device: browser
