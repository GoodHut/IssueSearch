 URL : "https://github.com/jahredhope/promise-file-reader/issues/4" TITLE : es6 -> es5 in npm package BODY : i'm using create-react-app and its webpack config does not apply babel to stuff in node_modules . the app works in dev mode because chrome understands es6 pretty well already, but when i run yarn build , this error shows up: failed to compile. static/js/main.6494367c.js from uglifyjs syntaxerror: unexpected token: operator > ./~/promise-file-reader/promisefilereader.js:5,0 the reason is => in index.js , which is not expected. could you please move from es6 to es5 in the published version? thanks for the wrapper! saves some time re-implementing it in every new project :â€“
