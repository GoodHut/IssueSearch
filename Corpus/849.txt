 URL : "https://github.com/learn-co-students/namespaced-routes-lab-v-000/issues/405" TITLE : this is bs BODY : the tests do not have anything to do with instructions in the readme. if you create a preference model and save it, is that preference for a specific user? is that preference for the whole app? there are unit tests for the preference model, but the controller tests don't create any preferences so there's no way to determine how to sort, and the tests don't even care about sort order anyways. this lab should either be fixed or removed. whoever let this into the curriculum didn't spend any amount of time reviewing it... 😢 🐼
