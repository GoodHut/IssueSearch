 URL : "https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-docs/issues/830" TITLE : sails hook load order BODY : hi! recently i was working on creating a sailjs hook, and i was not able to find a properly hook load order as part of the documentation. i'm just referring to basically a workflow of all the hooks that load as part of the core in order. something similar to the output that sails lift --verbose displays, but with a short description of them or maybe links to the documentation where they are explained. also as part of the workflow something explaining that the user installed hooks will load alphabetically first running the configure stage, and the again alphabetically running the initialize stage. this is somehow explained here http://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/extending-sails/hooks/hook-specification/configure but is tricky to understand the first time. this will help to understand better how to work properly with sails:hook:loaded event. please let me know your thoughts. i can help if required to make this üëç
