 URL : "https://github.com/HotswapProjects/HotswapAgent/issues/170" TITLE : info is unknown level? BODY : i am using eclipse ide, i made the necessary config to make my java app run with hotswap agent + dcevm. it looks like working ok but there is always a log issue with this line: hotswap agent: 09:03:58.732 warning org.hotswap.agent.config.logconfigurationhelper - invalid configuration value for property 'logger'. unknown log level 'info' is there really an absence of the log level info or am i missing something about this?
