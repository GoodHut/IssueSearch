BODY : i'm working on another project right now, but if i finish in time i will take a look at this. thoughts: you have two cores each with 96kb of ram. we could try creative things to transfer the data from the fifo directly into memory using dma. i don't know if there are gains from trying to grab half with each core. we could, more likely get the data from the fifo with chip one a n ship it to the spirit. while core one is done with the fifo, let core two start the same process, interleaving the frame grabs. or, perhaps 1 grabs a frame uses dma to hand it off to 2. letting one core grab frames and the other write to the display. i just guessing, i'm not sure where any bottlenecks exist. i just see an idle core and we know the much slower atmega328 can do this at about 2- 2.5 fps w/o fifo. the data transfer rates are really the limiters. if the data rates permit, we can actually hold 2 frames in memphis, one in each core. sorry for the probably off base rambling. very cool project!!!
