 URL : "https://github.com/lob/lob-python/issues/132" TITLE : import issue on aws lambda BODY : i get this error when trying to import lob on aws lambda: unable to import module 'lambda_function': no module named lob.resource one thing i'm doing that might be throwing it off is i'm installing the libraries in a subdirectory using this command: pip install -t libs/ lob . there is an __init.py__ file in that libs directory, and that allows me to import other libraries successfully pymysql, braintree, etc. using from libs import blah . but lob doesn't seem to like being imported that way. i've attached a .zip of my file structure for reference. lob_test.zip https://github.com/lob/lob-python/files/1177601/lob_test.zip
