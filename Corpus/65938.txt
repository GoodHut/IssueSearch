 URL : "https://github.com/joinfaces/joinfaces/issues/315" TITLE : location of xhtml files BODY : hi. in the examples the xhtml-files are located in src/main/resources/meta-inf/resources . when developing with netbeans this is not detected as webapp folder, so its under other sources which seems wrong. other jsf project seem to have the files under src/main/webapp which seems more natural and netbeans also shows this as web pages folder. if i run a project from netbeans it works fine, but if i try to run the generated jar, the files are not found. do i need to configure the folder somewhere or do the sources have to be under src/main/resources/meta-inf/resources ?
