 URL : "https://github.com/fippo/webrtc-externals/issues/7" TITLE : no graphs shown in edge BODY : hi @fippo !! currently i'm trying to test your extension in edge 40.15063.0.0. the result is that i am able to see the gum requests tab and the peerconnection tab. the problem is that no graphs are shown. only the peerconnection log. the last entry is the 'oniceconnectionstatechange' : connected. this is also reproducible on another pc with the latest edge in the insider preview rc3. am i doing something wrong or is a known issue?
