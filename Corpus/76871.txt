 URL : "https://github.com/Radarr/Radarr/issues/2019" TITLE : manual import of propers BODY : when using wanted->manual import to import movies i have noticed two things 1 when importing a file such as ghostbusters 1984 bluray 1080p proper,mkv the system imports the file and sets the quality to blueray 1080p but the proper is lost and the system will then sit and try to download a proper for this release. 2 when importing multiple movie files using either the manual or automatic the system does not pick up the movie titles - they have to be manually selected. i have tried with the movie files in subfolders by movie copied from another radarr system and with them loose in a single directory and niether one parses the filename correctly.
