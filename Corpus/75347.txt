 URL : "https://github.com/bnjjj/node-request-digest/issues/12" TITLE : had some difficulties... BODY : i'm helping a partner with integration that involves accessing a dev environment we run protected by digest auth. they were having some troubles related to the challenge/response setup. i'm not much of a node.js person myself, so i don't know if i'm doing something wrong or not, but the callback example listed here https://www.npmjs.com/package/request-digest doesn't seem to work. execution continues past digestrequest.request ... ; as determined by putting console.log statements around everything, but then... nothing. on top of that, it appears the underlying request module you depend on actually does digest auth, challenge/response, etc. specifically, this code actually wound up doing the trick: var request = require 'request' ; request.get 'https://our.internal.domain/', { 'auth': { 'user': 'our_dev_username', 'pass': 'our_dev_password', 'sendimmediately': false } }, function error, response, body { console.log 'error:', error ; console.log 'statuscode:', response && response.statuscode ; console.log 'body:', body ; } ; can you clarify what gap your lib is meant to fill, and maybe guide me on what's wrong with the callback example?
