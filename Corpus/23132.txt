 URL : "https://github.com/tedb-org/teDB/issues/9" TITLE : none unique index. BODY : it seems that if you index a field as not unique and submit many documents with the matching index field that those _ids are not listed in an array but instead are concat into one field. creating a very long string. this is not happening in the persisting of the data but in the actual indexing in the avl tree. the avl tree itself is tested for non unique indexed fields but tedb was not tested with non-unique indexed fields. new tests need to be written testing non-unique issues.
