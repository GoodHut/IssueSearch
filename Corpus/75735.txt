 URL : "https://github.com/jcrippen/texnologue/issues/3" TITLE : ibidem in citation style BODY : in lsalike.bbx, we are using the authoryear style line 33 , but in lsalike.cbx, we are using authoryear-icomp line 3 , giving ibid in in-text citations, but really no abbreviated or repeated forms in the bibliography. by my reading of the lsa style guide---and my experience with linguistics publishing in general, shouldn't we be using the authoryear style i.e., no ibid/idem for both the bibliography and citation style? or should this just be left up to personal preference?
