 URL : "https://github.com/efficient/libcuckoo/issues/73" TITLE : upsert not returning bool BODY : i'm having a weird problem with upsert . it's likely a user error, but i can't seem to figure it out. my compiler seems to think that it has a void return value. c++ bool test { cuckoohash_map<int, int> test; test.upsert 1, int& i { i = 1; } ; return test.upsert 1, int& i { i = 1; } ; } bash test.cpp: error: void value not ignored as it ought to be return test.upsert 1, int& i { i = 1; } ; ^ is there something obvious that i'm doing wrong? this is with gcc 5.3.0.
