 URL : "https://github.com/milgra/highsierramediakeyenabler/issues/12" TITLE : did you try this? BODY : on sierra, you had to disable the agent which is responsable for media keys to stop using itunes and being able to use spotify via: $ launchctl unload -w /system/library/launchagents/com.apple.rcd.plist 2> /dev/null however, on high sierra, it's quite the opposite. if you want to make it work with spotify or whatever, you have to load it $ launchctl load -w /system/library/launchagents/com.apple.rcd.plist 2> /dev/null it works to me, no more need to use your app.
