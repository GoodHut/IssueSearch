 URL : "https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot/issues/2281" TITLE : quicker feedback report BODY : i often find myself wanting to give quicker feedback about a test than test pilot currently allows. it seems kind of silly to take 5 minutes to fill out the same survey questions over and over again in order to give 1 or 2 sentences of feedback. for example, i'm piloting the containers feature. i wanted to give feedback that i'd like to be able to choose what container external links eg, from my email client open in. i ended up on github https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot-containers/issues/311 issuecomment-284010300 , but that's also inefficient because i either spend a long time searching for duplicates or you end up with a lot of duplicates. i ended up spending 10 minutes making a mockup anyway, but that's beside the point ðŸ˜›
