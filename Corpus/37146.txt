 URL : "https://github.com/cjlee112/socraticqs2/issues/629" TITLE : landing page changes BODY : nice @maksim.sokolski! i have some feedback but it would be nice to hear what @chris thinks as well. 1. the hero title and description should trigger interest, i.e. how can courselets help me as an instructor and what results have we seen. 2. cta should be something like “schedule a demo” and scroll down to the contact form. 3. remove the sections “what you’ll get from this hackathon”, “hackathon description” and “personal guides”. 4. update “i’m interested in the hackathon” and explain that chris will contact them for a personal demo if they submit their contact details. 3. can we remove all links in the topbar and just show “sign in” for guests? 3:29 it would be nice if we copy the styling from this version instead where it’s centered and include that topbar http://conceptinventory.org/hackathon/
