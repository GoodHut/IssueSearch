 URL : "https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/issues/4485" TITLE : cleanup test warnings BODY : when we converted to react 15.6 we started seeing some createclass test warnings: > warning: accessing proptypes via the main react package is deprecated, and will be removed in react v16.0. use the latest available v15. prop-types package from npm instead. for info on usage, compatibility, migration and more, see https://fb.me/prop-types-docs it would be great to clean those up. ! screen shot 2017-10-25 at 1.48.47 pm.png https://shipusercontent.com/137006b8a591682345b14113ff44d041/screen%20shot%202017-10-25%20at%201.48.47%20pm.png
