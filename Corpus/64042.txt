 URL : "https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-debugger-tools/issues/10" TITLE : file format for .neomap BODY : currently .neomap files are just comma separated values in text format. this makes it quite easy to generated in the compilers, however later on we might need to add more info, and since we'll need cooperation of several neo compilers c , java, python and more , we might be a good idea to decide on a proper format already. the neo team seems to favour .json format it is used in lots of places from the neo rpc protocol to the wallets config files so i would go with that. one possible format could be something like this: javascript { debug :{ compiler : neon.exe , files : { id : 1, url : c:\code\neo\mycontracts\test.cs } , map : { start : 0, end : 20, line : 49, file : 1 } } }
