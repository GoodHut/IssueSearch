 URL : "https://github.com/multiOTP/pjlink/issues/1" TITLE : i need pjlink class 2 BODY : dear developer, let me first praise this project. for me it's a verry helpful piece of code. i'm the thinker of the multimedia infrastructure department at ulm university, germany. we serve the infrastructure in over hundred classrooms and in at least twenty lecture halls. to improve our sevice quality, proactive monitoring is our goal. for doing this, i've developed some php-cli scripts, running on debian jessie, to control our multimedia infrastructure automaticaly. i collect the states of all our projectors with pjlink - cause it's the major intersection that every projector supports. i've written my own implementation of pjlink class 1. since a few weeks, we have some new powerful laser projectors, that now only supports pjlink class 2. i had to implement this. while my research i found your project and i thought, why should i reinvent the wheel? how do you think about the pjlink class 2 implementation? is there anything in progress? if not, i'm considering about implement class 2 on the base of your class 1 code. greetings, benjamin
