 URL : "https://github.com/datacarpentry/shell-genomics/issues/72" TITLE : bad-reads vs bad_reads BODY : some exercises and examples use the filename bad-reads.txt and others use bad_reads.txt . learners may end up with two different bad reads files and be confused about which they are using for a particular exercise. we should either distinguish between these two files if we want to make a point about using different methods to pull out the bad reads or make this consistent and make sure we're instructing the learners to delete the bad reads file between each new method.
