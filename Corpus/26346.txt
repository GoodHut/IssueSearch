 URL : "https://github.com/Spreads/Spreads/issues/83" TITLE : api docs generation BODY : docfx is working out of the box, but it doesn't support f projects. the f collections project has containers such as sortedmap , which is hard to move to c , but they mostly implement interfaces. it also has icursor implementations, which are mostly internal and are used via extension methods. those methods just wrap cursorseries around cursor factories and could be easily moved to the top spreads project. some issues: there should be no extension methods on object and on generic ones, that pollutes generated api docs. all corefx/corefxlab and other third-party code should be made internal unless we add some changes. should use internal visibility with internalsvisibleto . should investigate sandcastle if it works with any generate .xml docs. this is low priority since the source is open and there is no active users i am aware of. first need to make overview/tutorials/getting started. api docs could be a different section with different formatting, just a subfolder in the hugo site with a common template.
