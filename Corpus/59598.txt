BODY : i like this remark taken from here https://barbagroup.github.io/essential_skills_rrc/openlicenses/openlicensing/ > illustrating how subtle language variations matter, we recently decided to change our pick to the bsd 3-clause license. it is very similar to the mit license, but there is a small difference in the wording about attribution which we learned about from a comment by a. scopatz on a github discussion thread . > the mit license says: >>the above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software. > while bsd 3-clause says: >> redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer. > as scopatz noted, this language implies that a user could copy some of an mit-licensed code as long as the portion is deemed not substantial without attribution. in academia, we always prefer full attribution of any portions of copied works, and bsd 3-clause is more precise in this. i propose we go to bsd license. what do you think @jbarnoud @hublot ?
