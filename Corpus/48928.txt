BODY : the event which makes the dog walk towards the hidden staircase in wor mobliz was placed one step away from the entrance. by going left, you can easily avoid it and reach the staircase regardless. if you click under the black area to the right of the entrance, you'll hear the dog do a woof. if you go down the staircase and get back, the event has disappeared, so whether you move in front of the door or not, the dog'll stay there. however, the dog disappears as you defeat phunbaba. edit: and note that even though the dog never goes anywhere, it is there when you go downstairs. ! follow-the-dog https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19335211/27413304-c88a3290-56fa-11e7-8b3c-f66be9c32067.jpg
