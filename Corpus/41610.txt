 URL : "https://github.com/RRutsche/react-parallax/issues/25" TITLE : add a parentnode prop BODY : hi there, first, great work i really like this package. in one of my projects, the parallax component lives inside a div with a vertical overflow scroll. however, because the parallax component attaches the 'scroll' event handler to the window, there is no parallax effect as i scroll the div. i've created a dirty fix by adding a parentnode prop and attaching the dom event handlers to it instead of the window. https://github.com/philbot9/react-parallax/commit/888c0b14b17b3288cad945306a32cf5fc943667f then it's used like this: javascript <parallax parentnode={document.queryselector ' scrollable-div' }> ... would you be open to properly implementing a 'parentnode' prop?
