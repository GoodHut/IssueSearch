 URL : "https://github.com/line/line-bot-sdk-python/issues/77" TITLE : repeated error message. BODY : i started from a fresh lamp stack on ubuntu 16.04, updated it and installed the latest version of pip. then i installed the line bot sdk, and all the requirements. i made a new file, test.py and copy pasted the echobot script into it, changing the channel access token and secret. i also changed the app.run to app.run host= myip ,port=443 since the webhook url i gave was https://myip:443/. i ran this, and repeatedly got the same error code: 203.104.146.154 - - 22/nov/2017 02:44:07 code 400, message bad http/0.9 request type '\x16\x03\x03\x00\x82\x01\x00\x00~\x03\x03z\x14\xe4w\xca\x12\xc4$\xae\xaa\xcb\x02\x1bf \xa2s/\x11\xcd\\w\x0e~.\x03\xb2' 203.104.146.154 - - 22/nov/2017 02:44:07 ▒~z▒w▒▒$▒▒▒ ▒s/▒\w~.▒ ▒6▒,▒+▒/▒▒▒/5e 400 - not quite sure what to do tho, and any help would be appreciated.
