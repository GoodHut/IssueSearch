 URL : "https://github.com/Oire/TheQube/issues/67" TITLE : many tweets are truncated BODY : i notice that many tweets. especially if they are long replies, are now being truncated when reading tweets with the qube. it of a format similar to: this is a tweet, and it is truncatâ€¦ https://twitter.com/i/web/status/<numbers> not sure if there's a possibility of fixing this, but i figure i'd report it just in case. i'm using the qube commit e19fc16,though i'm sure it exists among earlier versions as well.
