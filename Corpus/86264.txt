 URL : "https://github.com/theodi/bothan/issues/276" TITLE : heroku deployment failing BODY : due to the addition of commonmarker in 267, heroku deployment is failing. commonmarker requires cmake , which isn't available by default on heroku for some reason. we need to look at upgrading the stack, or adding a buildpack to get it. it should be there by default on ubuntu though, so this is a bit odd.
