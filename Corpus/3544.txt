 URL : "https://github.com/reanahub/reana-job-controller/issues/44" TITLE : rfc job cache BODY : it'll be useful someday to have a central server-side job cache that could speed up the rerunning of workflows. and for sharing results among workflows that start with the same initial steps. each job execution run could optionally store results under: - /reana/jobs/:someid/input/... - /reana/jobs/:someid/output/... containing say sha1 information about the input file and parameters, the container environment used, the steps used, and that would store any desired output files of the step command there. if another job comes and uses the same environment image and the same input file and parameters, then the job execution could quickly return the pre-cached job output. this could be implemented at the level of the workflow.
