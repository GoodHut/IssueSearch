 URL : "https://github.com/arcreative/xbox-on/issues/9" TITLE : poweron not working BODY : hi, great plugin, however recently it has stopped working on the xbox-one, probably due to the recent firmware upgrade. i've verified it that a single udp packet is not sufficient to start the booting procedure but multiple udp packets will. for example, the python version of this application xbox-remote-power https://github.com/schamper/xbox-remote-power does still work because it sends multiple packets instead of one. the reason that i prefer a fix for this is because your application is used by an add-on for the athom homey device which multiple people use including myself, add-on page https://apps.athom.com/app/net.weejewel.xboxone . so could you please look into this issue. thank you!
