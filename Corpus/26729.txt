 URL : "https://github.com/akhoury/request-promise-cache/issues/1" TITLE : cache post requests BODY : i've been using request-promise-cache for a while now and while running some tests noted that the post request are not being cached anymore. i use request-promise-cache to cache api responses, various timeouts depending on the data. will post caching be added again? or is there another way to get it working?
