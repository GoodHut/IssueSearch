 URL : "https://github.com/libretro/retroarch-assets/issues/179" TITLE : flattening the history BODY : this repository history has little of any utility, and is huge. my .git is 195mb. i intend to flatten it and force push. this will reduce the .git to 72mb after recloning or otherwise deleting the old version . for reference, retroarch itself has a .git of 167mb. in the unlikely event that the history is useful for anything, i've copied it to <https://github.com/libretro/retroarch-assets-old1>. any objections?
