 URL : "https://github.com/LambdaHack/LambdaHack/issues/113" TITLE : permit window resizing BODY : honor minimal size --- the one we have currently that fits the whole hud. one difficulty of this issue is technical, catching the resize event and redrawing correctly. another is generalizing various ui-drawing code to cope with bottom line having a different number, etc. it's mostly hard-coded now and sometimes wrongly bound to dungeon level size instead of windows. lastly, the improved code should really use the extra screen space, not just pad with spaces.
