 URL : "https://github.com/inasafe/inasafe/issues/4162" TITLE : nice trees please BODY : problem at the moment we generate a tree that shows the execution path for the inasafe analysis. i think this is potentially a very useful way to let the user understand the analysis workflow but its very hard to make out from the current ascii art representation of a tree that is shown during the analysis. i would like to see if we can rather use a tree representation for the profiler report to make it easy to read. secondly having a tree view of the provenance would be very useful for the field mapping keywords where we have nested concepts. ideally we would use a css only solution, but it would be worth experimenting also to see if libraries like this will work: https://www.jstree.com expected behaviour user should be able to read and understand the progress reports.
