 URL : "https://github.com/elbywan/bosket/issues/8" TITLE : export core modules to umd BODY : i'm still using requirejs with riotjs. i can see bosket/riot/index.js contains the core modules, like dragndrop but i have no access to them, for example to use the dragndrop.selection preset. is there a way to access them, or could you export them as part of the pre-built index.js module?
