 URL : "https://github.com/EdwardDunn/Platform-Game/issues/32" TITLE : add animated background BODY : add animated background currently the background is a still image, it would be good if some parts where animated. an example of this would be to have moving clouds or rain. this could be done by adding extra components into the game, or you could look for copyright free backgrounds that already have some kind of effects. if you have any suggestions or need any help, just leave a comment.
