 URL : "https://github.com/glorquet/todos/issues/2" TITLE : add future planning BODY : it would be useful to plan a task to be done not only on the current day but on the next few days. it would allow the users to : - plan the next day so he can start with a day already planned - mark tasks that need to be done at a specific point in the future to be on his day list at that time. - plan multiple days ahead that would also be useful with a week display that would list the tasks sort of like a calendar.
