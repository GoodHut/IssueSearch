 URL : "https://github.com/nitramr/scribus-webpage/issues/17" TITLE : which theme to use? BODY : it has been suggested the the theme might be a bit too dark. how easy is it to change if needed? personally i like the dark theme - it's a good contrast with the images - but it might be good to be able to change it easily if there are more people who want it lighter.
