 URL : "https://github.com/konsolas/AAC-Issues/issues/1129" TITLE : falling through the blocks BODY : this bug has existed since june. since that time, many changes have been made, it began to happen less often, but it still happens. for example, this often happens when the player is teleported from a large distance there must be enough buildings around so that the chances around the player last longer . also, if you turn on phase check, then the bug appears less often with the phase check disabled, the bug appears often . also, this bug is manifested in the fact that players can pass through easily destructible blocks. video 1st person: https://radikal.ru/video/5r74cscdt2b video 3st person with console: https://radikal.ru/video/dfvoh0xebow without aac everything is fine ________________________________________________________________________________________________________ core information server version: paper 1.8.8 aac version: latest 3.3.7-b2 protocollib version: v4.3.0 plugin list: aac, protocollib, bedwarsrel, multiverse-core ________________________________________________________________________________________________________ log: https://pastebin.com/gmdr8bzs config: https://pastebin.com/wmnkrcjh ________________________________________________________________________________________________________ p.s. also this bug was checked with worldguard on paper 1.12.2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=45&v=7smlfjbuid4
