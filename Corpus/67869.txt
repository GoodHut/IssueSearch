 URL : "https://github.com/mwydmuch/ViZDoom/issues/191" TITLE : question user variables BODY : hello, i can't find any documentation on the user variables like the one used in the example on your website: it is also possible to access user variables user1, user2 ... user32 , which correspond to acs scripts' global variables 1-32. i've tried looking at acs documentation on zdoom and doom wikis, but i cannot find and reference to these global variables. is there a list somewhere of these variables? i am asking because i want to make the agent lose reward whenever it uses ammo so it learns to conserve it.
