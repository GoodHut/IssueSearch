 URL : "https://github.com/la-haute-societe/ssh-deploy-release/issues/5" TITLE : releases are not removed BODY : hello, the option releasestokeep seems not to be seen by the tool. const deployer = require 'ssh-deploy-release' ; const options = { localpath: '/users/joe/codex/', host: 'joe.com', port: '9222', username: 'joe', password: 'mypwd', allowremove: true, releasestokeep: 5, deploypath: '/var/lib/www/codex/', currentreleaselink: 'htdocs', exclude : '.svn/ ' }; const deployer = new deployer options ; deployer.deployrelease => { console.log 'ok !' } ; the releases are well deployed but none of the releases are removed ever. do i need to use removerelease explicitly? in that case, what is the purpose of allowremove and releasestokeep ?
