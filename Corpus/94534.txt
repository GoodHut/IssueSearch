 URL : "https://github.com/forcedotcom/LightningTestingService/issues/39" TITLE : capturing showtoast events BODY : i have some logic that display showtoast event for success && failure. i'd love to catch those events and so i can validate code works correctly. is there a way to catch system events using testing service? alternatively, is there a test.isrunningtest method equivalent from apex in lts so i could create a workarounds for such cases as above?
