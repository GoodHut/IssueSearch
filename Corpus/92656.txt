 URL : "https://github.com/oxygenxml/Oxygen-Git-Plugin/issues/51" TITLE : .gitignore file is ignored BODY : on a mac, two junk files you shouldn't check in are: icon .ds_store the icon one is special in that the file name contains a carriage return i.e. icon^m , which reduces the possibility of a naming conflict. right now icon files show up as being staged, despite being listed in .gitignore. since the .ds_store files are not showing up, i suspect the problem is handing special characters in the file name.
