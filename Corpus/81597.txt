 URL : "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-dsl-py/issues/581" TITLE : 0 hits from facetedsearch BODY : i'm trying something simple to see if i can get it working: i'm on 5.1 class dogsearch facetedsearch : fields = 'fleas' facets = { 'fleas': termsfacet field='fleas' , } index = settings.associations_index_name rs = dogsearch response = rs.execute but i'm getting 0 hits when i know there are lots of results. here's what it's generating when i run it: { query : { match_all : {}}, aggs : { _filter_fleas : { filter : { match_all : {}}, aggs : { fleas : { terms : { field : fleas }}}}}, highlight : { fields : { fleas : {}}}} { took :3, timed_out :false, _shards :{ total :5, successful :5, failed :0}, hits :{ total :0, max_score :null, hits : }, aggregations :{ _filter_fleas :{ doc_count :0, fleas :{ doc_count_error_upper_bound :0, sum_other_doc_count :0, buckets : }}}} could something be going wrong in the query, or am i just using this wrong?
