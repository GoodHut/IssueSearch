 URL : "https://github.com/nwallace/passff/issues/194" TITLE : host binary is dangerous BODY : the host allows any command to be executed. if there is a security issue in the addon, that would allow an attacker to do what he wants. see https://github.com/nwallace/passff/blob/master/src/host/passff.py l33 i've been working on browserpass. i think it would be great to define a common json protocol for the host to only have one binary to install and then choose between passff and browserpass.
