 URL : "https://github.com/cadeyrn/bookmarks-organizer/issues/22" TITLE : improve fox image BODY : from user feedback: the fox image on the right in the add-on page is very cute, but the white fur of the fox is too similar to the page background. i couldn't tell what the image was until i right click > view image'd it. maybe place it in a circular background for better contrast? this would also help give it the appearance of a button and better convey to users that it is click-able.
