 URL : "https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/issues/8232" TITLE : assets strange behavior BODY : i've created a new theme in app/themes and i want to override some syliusshopbundle templates, so what i've done is to copy a css file style.css in app/themes/mytheme/syliusshopbundle/public/css/style.css, after that, i have executed php bin/console sylius:theme:assets:install --symlink but when my page loads i'm getting 404 not found for the css file. i open the browser profile and the url generated is http://sylius.local/bundles/_themes/proveedor/my-theme/_themes/proveedor/my-theme/syliusshop/css/style.css . it seems the asset component is generating twice this part _themes/proveedor/my-theme . i tested the commando without --symlink option, i cleared the cache with command and manually but its not working. i really dont understand what its happening here. could someone help me to solve this issue?
