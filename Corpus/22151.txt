 URL : "https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/quickPlot/issues/5" TITLE : improved use of s4 BODY : see recently updated https://adv-r.hadley.nz/s4: - use constructors instead of new : > it’s also possible to create an instance using new and the name of the class. this is not recommended because it introduces some ambiguity. what happens if there are two packages that both define the person class? - don't use { in generics: > note that it is bad practice to use { in the generic function. this triggers a special case that is more expensive, and generally best avoided. - use of setoldclass : > if you’re trying to build an s4 class on top of a s3 class provided by a package, it is better to request that the package maintainer add this call to the package, rather than running it yourself.
