 URL : "https://github.com/plumi/plumi.app/issues/1490" TITLE : author page styling fixes BODY : reported by anna on 2 nov 2012 06:07 utc still remaining things: change vodcast button to orange rss button add location: text before the location e.g. location: melbourne, australia move location to sit with other info, above homepage remove text and link author's home page in this site in news and events listings below the author's videos - posted: nov 19, 2008 should appear directly below the title, then there should be a one line space before the summary text. space underneath news items without an image is way too large - this should just be a two line space. thumbnails incorrectly sized in video listing area change latest news to <username>'s news change latest events to <username>'s events add <username>'s audio or include audio files within the videos listing, but call this area media not videos move all events from this author & all news from this author closer to the content listed above remove such a big margin and create a bigger margin between this line and the next section below. moved this ticket from here: https://redmine.engagemedia.org/issues/3138
