 URL : "https://github.com/fedora-infra/tahrir/issues/358" TITLE : multiply awarded badges BODY : can the badges system support the idea of awarding the same badge to the same person multiple times? i know we do that now with the series badges, like for blog posts. could we add some badges that just accumulate and show a number icon?
