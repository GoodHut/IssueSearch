 URL : "https://github.com/cloudant-labs/envoy/issues/182" TITLE : writting custom auth BODY : i'm in process of writing custom auth, looking at the code, in the current auth plugin, it imports app object like: app = require '../../../app' this is very convenient, from this i can load all the options, even cloudant driver. but if i'm loading custom auth, from outside, how can i get these variables. this is what i have currently: myauth = require './envoy_auth' ; var opts = { databasename: notes , couchhost: 'http://test:test@localhost:5984', sessionhandler :sessionhandler, port: 3035, logformat: 'dev', production: true, static: path.join __dirname, './public' , router: router, envoyauth: myauth, }; var envoy = require 'cloudant-envoy' opts ; how can i load app from within my custom envoy_auth?
