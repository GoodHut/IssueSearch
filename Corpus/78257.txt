 URL : "https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-flake8/issues/347" TITLE : possible coloring issue? BODY : hi @arcanemagus not sure if this is flake8 related or theme related... as shown in the below screenshot, i noticed the text in warning tooltips in flake8 is really hard to see. i guess it's probably the material-ui theme i'm using that's causing the issue, but i also know some lintering have their own custom styling. so just wonder if it's flake8's issue here. if it is, hope it can be resolved. thanks. ! image https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17170199/22853728/d2e6fa0c-f0b1-11e6-8fdf-03a35e73fa63.png
