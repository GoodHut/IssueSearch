 URL : "https://github.com/duoduoeeee/bilibili-embed/issues/1" TITLE : responsive iframe problem BODY : i implemented some js from the embed function of mastodon so that the cards go responsive but the js failed to do its magic. the iframes kept their default height and refuses to adjust to content inside them. the embed code i use looks like the following: html <iframe src= https://localhost/embed.php?svc=user&res=282994 class= jinkela style= max-width: 100%; border: 0 width= 400 ></iframe><script src= https://localhost/embed.js async= async ></script>
