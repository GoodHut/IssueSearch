 URL : "https://github.com/javivelasco/react-css-themr/issues/42" TITLE : release for 1.7.2? BODY : i just recently updated a large chunk of my dependencies to fix some issues i was having. once i updated, however, react-css-themr started breaking my build. after some investigation, it appears the issue has already been fixed with this commit https://github.com/javivelasco/react-css-themr/commit/cb0501fe98317318ec4fa7272d66ab3926719455 . wondering when react-css-themr is going to get the hotfix uploaded to npm, or if there is an alternate solution for dealing with the undefined mixinvalue variable. thanks
