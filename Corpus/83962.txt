 URL : "https://github.com/marklogic/corb2/issues/46" TITLE : connect to multiple hosts BODY : i don't think this is possible yet - i'd like to be able to specify multiple hosts to connect to same port/username/password/database for all of them and have corb2 round-robin requests to those hosts. in the past, i've had the benefit of a load-balancer in front of the hosts, but i've run into environments where that's not an option. i'm thinking of something like: xcc-hosts=host1,host2,host3 xcc-username= xcc-password= xcc-port= xcc-database=
