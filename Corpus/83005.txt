 URL : "https://github.com/opengeospatial/geopackage/issues/285" TITLE : blob format test is wrong BODY : http://geopackage.org/spec/ _data_23 test method 3.c.iv. st_isempty is not part of the specification. this clause should be removed. gc.flags.envelope != 0 and envelope values are not nan is illogical. the envelope flag determines the presence/absence of envelope values and indicates the size. there is no obvious way to test whether the bytes in the envelope position constitute a valid envelope. i recommend dropping all of iv. from the test.
