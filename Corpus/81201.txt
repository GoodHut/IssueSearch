 URL : "https://github.com/kittn/generator-kittn/issues/22" TITLE : webpack works not nicely BODY : webpack experts needed. the current webpack workflow have several issues. webpack with custom url and hmr in combination with a custom url, hmr didn't trigger. any change on a js file didn't trigger hmr in the browser webpack with custom url without hmr any change on a js file have to bundle manually, otherwise you get no updates. overall webpack config its ugly, not smart enough.
