 URL : "https://github.com/DMOJ/judge/issues/287" TITLE : deprecate java 7 BODY : java 7 is eol and has been for a while now; it should meet the same fate as the c++0x executor. java 8 will be eol before we know it, too, and as of java 10 there's a new, faster release cycle twice a year . > oracle has proposed a new version scheme yy.m starting in march, 2018. java se 18.3 will be a short term release and users should transition to the next release when available. _from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/eol-135779.html_ interestingly, oracle seems to be using yy.m, while openjdk appears to be incrementing the version numbers as before 18.3 is actually java 10 . we should come up with a sane roadmap on how we're going to proceed with supporting java.
