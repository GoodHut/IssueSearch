 URL : "https://github.com/codesuki/ecs-nginx-proxy/issues/18" TITLE : redirect http to https BODY : don't know if helpful, but to redirect http to https, i used this code: https://stackoverflow.com/a/35097290/3019499 server { listen 81; return 301 https://$host$request_uri; } then the elb listens on port 80 and goes to port 81 for the ecs-nginx-proxy. not sure if this should be a default handy feature of the proxy, or turned on on demand
