 URL : "https://github.com/ros-visualization/rviz/issues/1150" TITLE : librviz display topic BODY : hello everyone, i am trying to use librviz to display other topic into a custom gui. i follow this tutorial http://docs.ros.org/indigo/api/librviz_tutorial/html/index.html url however, grid is too simple to make sense in details. i try to add my own rviz::display point_ in myviz.h, and the following code in myviz.cpp: point_ = manager_->createdisplay rviz/pointcloud2 , pointcloud2 , true ; ros_assert point_ != null ; point_->subprop topic ->setvalue /kinect2/sd/points ; point_->subprop style ->setvalue flat squares ; point_->setfixedframe kinect2_ir_optical_frame ; there is no error shows when i compiled. however, it only shows the adjusted grid in tutorial without my point cloud. does anyone have some experience about that? any ideas are appreciated!!!
