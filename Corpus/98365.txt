 URL : "https://github.com/koelling/dnacol/issues/4" TITLE : integrate with lesspipe.sh BODY : :link: lesspipe.sh https://www-zeuthen.desy.de/~friebel/unix/lesspipe.html is a popular configuration for lessopen that dispatches to different filters depending on file types. as far as i understand, it should be able to integrate dnacol with lesspipe.sh by providing an appropriate .magic file that informs lesspipe.sh of the supported file types. it would be great if dnacol would ship with the required configuration to make setup easy for interested users.
