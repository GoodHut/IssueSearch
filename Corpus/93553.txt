 URL : "https://github.com/brangerbriz/wifi-data-safari/issues/7" TITLE : admin should also be an ap BODY : everyone on the data safari needs to be on the same network obviously should that network be broadcast from the admin computer? hostapd? if so will we need 2 network devices one for mon0 && one to act as the ap , which is then maybe tethering it's connection to the internet from a phone if we need it, for maps for example ... which might require a 3rd network interface?
