 URL : "https://github.com/ESIPFed/sweet/issues/52" TITLE : updating entries at cor BODY : @lewismc @graybeal > note that dispatch of http://sweeteontology.net/ is currently powered by the cor see 51 . in general, this entry is to determine the conditions that will trigger the registration of a new revision of the sweet ontologies at the cor upon changes in this git repo such that resolution through http://sweeteontology.net/ reflect the changes. possible conditions/considerations: - trigger a new revision at the cor upon any change to any of the ontology files. the change logic can, at least initially, be based on a direct plain diff operation. later on, as deemed necessary, perhaps consider some mechanism a la owldiff, or based on jena's isisomorphic operation, or something along those lines. - update cor entries only upon a published release here at github. all ontology entries will be updated at the cor without inspection of contents. variations of this include: - only update those entries having a change in owl:versioninfo . pressumably, a release will typically reflect a new owl:versioninfo . - only update those entries with a diff. any other considerations/comments/etc?
