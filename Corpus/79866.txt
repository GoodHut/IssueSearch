 URL : "https://github.com/Sediments/Compressions/issues/7" TITLE : suggestion sample config BODY : i'm looking at the config and really can't figure it out. maybe its the formatting or how things are setup but i can't a see a single block that is compressed in the config. would you be able to add a sample in the configs that compresses something not normally compressed like cactus or bones so that we can see how its supposed to be done.
