 URL : "https://github.com/flexsurfer/re-frisk/issues/26" TITLE : free text search BODY : sometimes finding data buried in our ever growing app-db can be tedious. i think it would be great if we could filter the app state using free text search. we had something very similar in our app before we swapped in favour of re-frisk, and we found it very useful. happy to discuss further and/or submit a pr : luke
