 URL : "https://github.com/vsternbach/angular-ts-decorators/issues/15" TITLE : suppress warning messages BODY : when we do not provide an explicit ngmodule/injectable name the library throws a warning message telling you are not providing explicit name be careful this code might not work as expected when minified . but if i'm 100% percent sure that the code will work i.e. by disabling function manging in webpack , i would want not to see those messages polluting the console. is it possible to introduce kind of a flag to suppress them? thank you!
