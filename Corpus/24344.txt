 URL : "https://github.com/mageinferno/magento2-docker-compose/issues/62" TITLE : source code volume BODY : is it possible to setup the source code volume before running the setup cmd : docker-compose run --rm setup so i don't have to copy files from container to my machine in order to start developing a module. in fact, i want the hole source code to be in my machine including vendor,cache.. so i can explore magento core and phpstorm can index better.
