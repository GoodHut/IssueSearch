 URL : "https://github.com/Unbiasify/unbiasify/issues/43" TITLE : reorganize and add build BODY : everything's looking awesome so far, wanted to add my 2 cents: 1. moving all the source to a src/ folder and adding in gulp/broccoli/rollup for builds will add some nice things: - transpilation - lower bundle size - ability to use modules - nicer code organization 2. adding that build step to ci will also add some niceness to testing it's more work to set up, but the long term impact is probably super helpful.
