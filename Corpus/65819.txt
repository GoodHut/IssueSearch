 URL : "https://github.com/naturalatlas/node-gdal/issues/211" TITLE : lighter appveyor config BODY : hi, currently we have 16 builds in appveyor: - 4 node versions - x 2 architectures - x 2 visual studio toolsets if appveyor works weel, it takes more than 2 hours 40 minutes to complete a build sequence, which is a bit too much. as we plan to drop node 0.10 support, we fall to 12 build and 2 hours. can we also drop the visual studio 2013 toolset, since we are now on modern node versions? we would have finally 6 build, so ~1 hour. we could also go further and just build minimal environments for pr, and full sequence for releases. wdyt?
