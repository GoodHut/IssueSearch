 URL : "https://github.com/travoltron/plaid/issues/11" TITLE : upgrade from legacy api BODY : i was receiving the following error: array:4 “code” => 1114 “message” => “unauthorized environment” “resolve” => “your client id is not authorized to access this api environment. contact support@plaid.com to gain access.” “access_token” => array:1 “error” => “cannot post /item/public_token/exchange” i reached out to plaid support and got the following response: > due to your account being instated after march 9th of this year, which was the cutover date from our legacy to current api, you will only have access to make calls using the current api. i’ve reviewed the wrapper that you are working with, and since it doesn’t look like it has been updated in over a year, it most likely isn’t compatible with the new version. are there any plans to upgrade this package to use the latest api instead of legacy?
