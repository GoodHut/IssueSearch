 URL : "https://github.com/cloudfour/pwastats/issues/100" TITLE : tweak tweet language BODY : when the first automated tweet went out, i realized that the tweet didn't contain any of the interesting bits. https://twitter.com/pwastats/status/856582720574640128 i'd like to see the tweets contain some of the data from the actual content. i'm going to experiment with changing iftt's template, but before i do so, i wanted to record the current template: new pwa stats resource! this one focuses on {{entrytitle}}. {{entryurl}}
