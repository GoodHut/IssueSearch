 URL : "https://github.com/philbooth/check-types.js/issues/71" TITLE : question: custom errors BODY : __question: custom errors__ check.assert value, message throws an error if value is false , setting message on the error instance. is there a simple way to extend assert to throw a custom error type while maintaining all the core functionality? i have a few workarounds in mind, just wanted to check if y'all thought about this use case first. --- _btw i love the library, great work._ üëç
