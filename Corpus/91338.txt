 URL : "https://github.com/Stereo101/miltonEye/issues/1" TITLE : the sound can be improved BODY : first of: this project is really really awesome. i wanted to do the same as screensaver for my desktop, but i couldn't figure out how to extract the eye from the game. now the issue: the sound varies a bit in the game, which does a great part for the recognition value of milton. again, i don't know where the sound is stored/generated/synthesized but if i can help to improve this, let me know.
