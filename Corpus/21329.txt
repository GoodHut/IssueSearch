 URL : "https://github.com/andreasindal/laravel-markdown/issues/14" TITLE : expose line method BODY : hello, it would be really great to being able to use the parsedown' line method directly from the facade, for some inliner use cases : php {!! markdown::line $markdown !!} right now, the only way i found to format a string without wrapping paragraph is to call parsedown directly, but i don't feel good with this... i'd really prefer to use the package i did install php {!! parsedown::instance ->line $markdown !!} thank you so much
