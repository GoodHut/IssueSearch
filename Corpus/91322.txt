 URL : "https://github.com/symfony-cmf/media-bundle/issues/160" TITLE : the future of this bundle BODY : for the current cmf release this bundle was abendoned. but i and @binhle410 still see a future of this bundle. future is seen and wanted by all of the @symfony-cmf/contributors but we are not enough. but with some help of @binhe410 we can get this bundle on the road again. future lives in visions and my visions for this bundles are: easy usage to get that i would like add more example documents instead of interfaces only. someone using different behavior can simply extend and replace a specific method instead of implementing a complete class. this would also mean to update the documentation and add uscases. one of the other example would be a file/image/media which is simple a reference to the file/image/media by path and name to not persist the content itself. with usecases in the docs i also mean, how to attach a file/image/media to a document. cause here the phpcr tree will be used first. own admin support instead of the hard dependency on sonata-media i would suggest to add own simple admins to sonata-phpcr-admin-integration-bundle. the current form type can help with some extra love. for sure we still need sonata, but only for gallery then, who would need a gallery, when there would be an extra preview onhover in treebrowser? ckeditor support not sure if the current controller does it but it would be nice if he would enable upload for ckeditor. hierarchy vs. hierarchy on my own fork i replaced the bundle own hierachyinterface by the one of phpcr-odm, but it feels wrong as the first means a file system hierarchy and the second means a hierarchy in a tree of documents. symfony 3.0, filestructure .... just the stuff we also did in the other bundles.
