 URL : "https://github.com/stcorp/harp/issues/134" TITLE : add support for lwc/iwc BODY : add support for cloud ice water content and cloud liquid water content. see e.g. cams ciwc https://software.ecmwf.int/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageid=51710579&src=contextnavpagetreemode and clwc https://software.ecmwf.int/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageid=51710583&src=contextnavpagetreemode . we have to see whether we want to treat this as a 'species' similar to how we now treat q https://software.ecmwf.int/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageid=51708881&src=contextnavpagetreemode as just 'h2o'. this would mean treating iwc and lwc as 'species'. the 'specific' content would then translate to a mass mixing ratio. we also have to check if the 'cloud' prefix is needed: is there something like iwc/lwc that is not linked to cloud content?
