 URL : "https://github.com/shazow/rateio/issues/1" TITLE : please make a releas BODY : hey andrey, i'm packaging your ssh-chat and more than a half of its dependencies don't have any releases. how am i supposed to package them if they don't have any release versions in pkgsrc, we rely on release versions with a well-defined sorting order ? as a temporary workaround, i use version 0.0.1 for the latest versions on github. it would be cool if you made a release of rateio. it's just a couple of clicks. many thanks, alex
