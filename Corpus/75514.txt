 URL : "https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-tab-view/issues/328" TITLE : how can i disabled a tab BODY : hi everybody, i would like to be able to make tabs enable/disable according to the routes state. i'm defining the routes as: var routes = {key: 'friends', title: 'friends', enabled: false }, {key: 'contacts', title: 'contacts', enabled: true }, i'm applying a different style to the header label if __enabled !== true__ i'm also recalculating the enabled flag during __componentwillreceiveprops nextprops __ the third part will be: canjumptotab = route => { return route.enabled ; } actual behaviour my problem: if focus is in tab 'friends', and then 'friends' get disabled, the app get in a loop because it tries to go to a tab where it is not allowed. any idea how can i achieve this without redefining the entire tabviewanimated?. thanks for your help and suggestions.
