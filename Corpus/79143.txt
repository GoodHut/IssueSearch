 URL : "https://github.com/fritz-c/react-sortable-tree/issues/163" TITLE : rst__node styling issues BODY : i have been trying to change the styling of rst__node from generatenodeprops but it reflects only on rst__row. the classname, onclick and others. i need to change the background color and capture clicks on the whole of rst__node and not just the rst__ row. i am able to get the whole node on hover but not other properties. any suggestions? @fritz-c is this possible?
