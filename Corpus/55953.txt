 URL : "https://github.com/ceylon/ceylon-ide-netbeans/issues/1" TITLE : make a release please. BODY : it would be great, if you can craete a 0.0.1 pre-release or so that we can test it. i know we can compile it by our own but if the features are still usable, it would be good to hold it for a releasable version. regards chris
