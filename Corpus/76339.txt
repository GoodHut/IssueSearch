 URL : "https://github.com/OasisDEX/oasis/issues/312" TITLE : issue with eth-mkr order BODY : hello, i am having issues with a recent order. i am running metamask, and was able to wrap my eth no problem. but whenever i tried to make a buy order, the default gas/gwei would give me a nonce too low error even after several attempts to submit. i assumed it was a parity problem, and was able to finally put in a buy order at some figure earlier today. i saw that my w-eth has left my wallet, but my trade history both open and closed show nothing, and no mkr in my account either. is my buy order just incomplete and won't appear until it is, or misplaced?
