 URL : "https://github.com/OpenSCAP/scap-security-guide/issues/1950" TITLE : mcafee virus scan BODY : why is there a check for mcafee virus scan in the rhel7 stig? i am using the centos variation. shouldn't this only be checking the compliance of the os and maybe doing a variety of checks for a variety of antivirus packages, but something smells about the explicit check for mcafee. i vote that this check is remove to a generic requirement for antivirus. one that simply can't be verified and will need to be done so manually, just as before.
