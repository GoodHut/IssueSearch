 URL : "https://github.com/Yubico/yubioath-desktop/issues/149" TITLE : suggested ux improvements BODY : a few things i noticed playing with the current git version 4.0.1-16-ge0e59dd . the file>exit menu item should either be e&xit or &quit i.e. the keyboard should be x or q, as with any other app, but not &exit as it currently is . the enter key does nothing in the passphrase dialog when the checkbox has focus i.e. enter passphrase, tab to checkbox, space to check it, pressing enter should click ok as it does when the text box has focus, but it does not when the search text box has focus, i'd expect the escape key to clear the current search terms muscle memory from using search in web browsers like chrome or firefox
