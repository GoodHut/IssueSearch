 URL : "https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-library/issues/900" TITLE : fuse symbol in device.lib BODY : the current newest device.lib shows only a small box with a line through it for a fuse. ieee std 315-1975 section 9.1.1 shows this as one usable fuse symbol, but also a small box with lines at each of the small sends and a pair of arcs in series. @jkriege2 why did you only select this one symbol? this symbol is marked in the ieee doc as iec so perhaps it was the most commonly accepted and so deemed the best single symbol for kicad? i personally prefer the double arc symbol, but i think this is regional. would anyone object to me adding them back into the library, perhaps as fuse_alt and fuse_alt_small ?
