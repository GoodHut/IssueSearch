 URL : "https://github.com/LegNeato/cups-sys/issues/2" TITLE : use ippserver from ipp.rs BODY : it would be great to set up a fake printer for tests, as some tests like printing! may cause real-world changes and different developers or ci could have different printers defined. looks like https://github.com/dremon/ipp.rs has some server support we could possibly leverage. see https://github.com/dremon/ipp.rs/blob/master/examples/ippserver.rs
