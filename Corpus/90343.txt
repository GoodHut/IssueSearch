 URL : "https://github.com/AgNO3/jcifs-ng/issues/22" TITLE : server enumeration broken BODY : as mentioned in 20 server enumeration is broken: - enumeration tries to connect with an empty hostname, previously this seems to have been magically resolved to the master browser - the relevant code lacks a smb2 implementation the domain/workgroup enumeration through smb://name is affected by the second issue as well but generally does not work if the name can be resolved through dns then there is no indication that it is a workgroup name and will be treated as a server . not sure whether to fix it try netbios first for these cases , drop it or just leave it with that gotcha.
