 URL : "https://github.com/fastmail/authentication_milter/issues/7" TITLE : support quarantine policy BODY : the milter api supports the ability for the milter to ask the mta to quarantine the message. are there any plans to implement this in the milter protocol and perhaps controlled by a hard-quarantine configuration option mirroring the current hard-reject option implement support for this in the dmarc handler when the dmarc policy is p=quarantine? thanks.
