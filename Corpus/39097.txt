 URL : "https://github.com/serghey-rodin/vesta/issues/1177" TITLE : request theme engine BODY : why doesn't vestacp have a theme engine even though many people want it? other panels, like sentora has a theme engine which allows people to customize their panel's looks. i prefer vestacp in every way over all other panels, except the fact that it doesn't have a theme engine. i'd really like to see a theme engine on vestacp on the next update, as well as an active development. perhaps some api and documentation may help? thanks!
