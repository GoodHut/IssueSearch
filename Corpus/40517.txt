 URL : "https://github.com/3Blades/app-backend/issues/24" TITLE : update api endpoints BODY : we need to update our endpoints to support: - optional namespaces : this would help us not have to maintain separate endpoints for different namespace types, the user would just have implicit access or not depending on the role they authenticated with. - add subsystem placeholder in endpoint : would help us add more subsystems later without having to roll out breaking changes to endpoints post /api/app/v1/ optional_namespace/ model/ uuid /start/ - actions : actions should represent object created by users, so that we can obtain streaming logs, satuses, etc just like we do for job and model servers. if response is immediate, success or failed state should be returned. if operation is async, response should return 202 accepted with in progress state and then should change to success or failed state after. return schema should have resource uri of created action. - attributes: resource_uri, uuid, object, action, method, path, user, user_agent, start_date, end_date, state, ip, location, is_user_action, can_be_cancelled, can_be_retired - events : should be created every time an object is created or changes state. - attributes: type job, model, datasource, file, etc , action, parents server, action - object to which the action is applied to , resource_uri, state, uuid, datetime - errors : document error codes better
