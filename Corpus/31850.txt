 URL : "https://github.com/MintcoinCommunity/Mintcoin-Desktop-Wallet/issues/23" TITLE : sync taking forever BODY : i am using version 2.0.2.0 on ubuntu 17.04. fresh install, tried bootstrap and using network. i installed this so i can use the minting option. my problem is that after 1 days, i am still only 15% in sync. it is ridiculously slow. i hope i am missing something, otherwise, i am thinking this may not be worth the time. is there a different way i can do this, or is there a way to do this online? issue with online- it works for a bit then stops, works for a bit, then stops. active connections are 7, that is the most i have seen. i have also seen 6. this option as it works now is obviously not an option as i gain about 1/2 a percent in a handful of hours. issue with bootstrap- it is a bit faster, but ties up computer resources. cpu utilization is much higher than when trying to use network. was able to get approx 15% by starting with bootstrap and trying to continue on network. either there is no option to continue with bootstrap or i did not see it. is there a way to download this so i can just put in the data vs whatever it is doing now? i can download the bootstrap file very quickly, so that would be easy to do. any other ideas would be appreciated, but at this time, it is very discouraging to new users to work in time tables and have the only solution fail to function in a timely manner.
