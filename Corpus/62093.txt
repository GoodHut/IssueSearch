 URL : "https://github.com/Scordo/TS3QueryLib.Net/issues/27" TITLE : cannot catch any events BODY : hi again, i have problem with event catching. i was trying to follow instructions from ts3 forum and from http://ts3querylib.codeplex.com/sourcecontrol/changeset/view/59138 1119306 url but nothing worked. here is my simplified code how i try to track notifications. public static void event_event object sender, clientmovedeventargs e { console.writeline i'm here ; } private void connect { querydispatcher = new asynctcpdispatcher serveraddress, port ; querydispatcher.bandetected += querydispatcher_bandetected; querydispatcher.readyforsendingcommands += querydispatcher_readyforsendingcommands; querydispatcher.serverclosedconnection += querydispatcher_serverclosedconnection; querydispatcher.socketerror += querydispatcher_socketerror; queryrunner = new queryrunner querydispatcher ; queryrunner.registerfornotifications servernotifyregisterevent.server ; queryrunner.notifications.clientmoved += event_event; querydispatcher.connect ; } private void querydispatcher_readyforsendingcommands object sender, system.eventargs e { queryrunner.login admin, pass ; queryrunner.selectvirtualserverbyport serverport ; } here is example for moving from channel to channel. no idea what could be wrong. i'm for sure connected to server because i check it by sending a poke command and i see my query client in server also.
