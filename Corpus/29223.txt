 URL : "https://github.com/chromakode/react-html-email/issues/40" TITLE : keep package simple BODY : is it possible to separate the injectreactemailattributes functionality from the other stuff? this is really the only feature i need, but i'm not sure if it's as simple as copy pasta. furthermore i don't believe it's wise to set the head in react/jsx. email head elements can get really complex so it should just be a string imo. this would allow for something like: import as react from 'react'; import {staticrouter} from react-router ; import {rendertostaticmarkup} from react-dom/server ; import {createlocation} from 'history'; import logo from ./components/logo ; import head from ./head ; import injectreactemailattributes from ./inject-react-email-attributes : injectreactemailattributes ; export default function locals:utils.locals { const location = createlocation locals.path ; return <!doctype html public -//w3c//dtd xhtml 1.0 strict//en http://www.w3.org/tr/xhtml1/dtd/xhtml1-strict.dtd > + <html data-editor-version= 2 class= sg-campaigns xmlns= http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml > + head + <body> + rendertostaticmarkup <staticrouter location={location} context={locals}> <logo /> </staticrouter> + </body></html> ;
