 URL : "https://github.com/hapijs/joi/issues/1296" TITLE : .when directly on object BODY : i'm trying to validate an object that should execute update rules based on the existence of the id property. currently doing it like: exports.createorupdate = joi.object .when 'id', { is: joi.string , then: exports.update, otherwise: exports.create, } ; but somehow only the exports.update is being used. is it even possible to directly use .when 'id' ?
