 URL : "https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/24840" TITLE : checkbounds is a mess BODY : the documentation for checkbounds says that it returns true if an index or indices are in bounds: > checkbounds bool, a, i... > > return true if the specified indices i are in bounds for the given array a. subtypes of abstractarray should specialize this method if they need to provide custom bounds checking behaviors; however, in many cases one can rely on a's indices and checkindex. however, the methods seem to variously return nothing or throw an error, return true or throw an error and maybe somewhere there's a method that actually does what the docs say.
