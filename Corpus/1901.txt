BODY : i ordered a ret6 board from aliexpress: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/stm32f103ret6-arm-stm32-minimum-system-development-board-module-for-arduino-minimum-system-board-stm32f103c8t6-upgrade-version/32787890975.html it seems pretty nice so far, but this board had to be different and have the led on pb11. is there a sanctioned way of building for arbitrary blinkenlitchen locations?
