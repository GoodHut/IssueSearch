BODY : isn't there a bug in creating the block header? for example work->data 17 = swab32 curtime ; is used in the below excerpt. but shouldn't that be done only on big endian machines? my reasoning is this: the following example code does not convert the time also nor version, nor bits , and stilll gets the right answer: https://pastebin.com/raw/bw3fqa2a therefore, maybe cpuminer does it wrong? same/similar argumentation for the fields version and bits . also, in scanhash_sha256_xxx the following is used memcpy data, pdata + 16, 64 ; but isn't the offset 16 wrong? shouldn't that be 0 ? cpu-miner.c ... / assemble block header / work->data 0 = swab32 version ; for i = 0; i < 8; i++ work->data 8 - i = le32dec prevhash + i ; for i = 0; i < 8; i++ work->data 9 + i = be32dec uint32_t merkle_tree 0 + i ; work->data 17 = swab32 curtime ; work->data 18 = le32dec &bits ; ...
