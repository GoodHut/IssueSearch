 URL : "https://github.com/4minitz/4minitz/issues/382" TITLE : reoccurring global note? BODY : we are using the global note to outline the purpose of the meeting and some housekeeping, can this be made reoccurring? i imagine if ical support is added this would be sent within an ical as the body? p.s. please tell me if i am over stepping or should be adding feature requests elsewhere.
