 URL : "https://github.com/Spreads/Spreads/issues/78" TITLE : snapshot + deltas cursor BODY : this pattern is used quite often, even is a context not related to numeric data at all, e.g. when a snapshot is on average many times larger than delta it is just wasteful and slow to resend it every time. the most obvious case is order book. something like: deltacursor<tsnapshot, tdelta> where tsnapshot : isnapshot<tdelta> and tdelta : idelta<tsnapshot> . just need to couple the two types with a simple contract. also need to make sure that we always use constrained calls to avoid boxing and virtual calls.
