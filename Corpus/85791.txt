 URL : "https://github.com/jfurrow/flood/issues/490" TITLE : flood database corruption BODY : one time i managed to break flood settings database. it took several setting changes and page refreshes to do so. when this happened flood refused to load and i needed to reinstall. i will try to reproduce this and see when and how it happens. will it be better to use some file database like sqlite for example instead of json flat files to store the application settings and data?
