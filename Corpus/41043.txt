 URL : "https://github.com/Kymeric/DockerProxy/issues/1" TITLE : why aspnet? question BODY : just bumped into this. nice! i pretty sure that the extra 172. container network is seen as a feature my ms. it does keep some concerns isolated ie port collisions . and this is really just a dev issue. any proper orchestrator deals with this. but i'm a dev and this is a pita. so thank you : but... q: why use aspnetcore at all? why not a more simple console app that just hosts the proxymanager?
