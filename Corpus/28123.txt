 URL : "https://github.com/PascalCoin/PascalCoin/issues/40" TITLE : feature: add a hook BODY : i have a suggestion a comming version of pascalcoin. it would be practical to have a hook. the wallet should scan incomming payloads for a marker and then if the marker is found it should launch an external program with the sender and the payload as parameters. perhaps also other parameters like timestamp and block number. there should also be a place where users can set the marker and the path to the external program.
