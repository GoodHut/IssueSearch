BODY : i'm wondering if is viable to speed up this library doing all the quantization and color palette stuff in a shader. i'm not exactly sure what goes on in the guts of this library, but it seems like if you just need to reduce the palette and pass it through something like this https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4ddgwr could work. i think this could also take care of flipping the pixels and swapping from rgb to bgr very easily. any thoughts?
