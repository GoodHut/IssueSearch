 URL : "https://github.com/Esri/esri-system-js/issues/29" TITLE : typescript and dojo BODY : i'm running into an issue with using dojo with the systemjs loader. for instance, i'd like to use dojo/dom or the require statement but when i try to add the following import statement, i get an error saying cannot find module 'dojo/dom'. import dom from 'dojo/dom'; i've looked around a bit and can't find anywhere that is explicitly using the dojo tools with the esri-system-js loader. i'm sure that i've missed a step somewhere to include dojo, does anyone know how?
