 URL : "https://github.com/Starcounter/Guidelines/issues/20" TITLE : branches in the apps BODY : there is a proposal to change the branch names in sample apps. right now we have branches: - master : - according to branching.md https://github.com/starcounter/guidelines/blob/master/branching.md : the branch that works with the latest starcounter release version 2.2 - according to continuous_integration.md https://github.com/starcounter/guidelines/blob/master/continuous_integration.md what is tested automatically: kitchensink master branch with starcounter release nightly 2.2 - develop : - according to branching.md https://github.com/starcounter/guidelines/blob/master/branching.md : the branch that works with the latest starcounter develop version and preferably also with the latest starcounter release version 2.4, 2.2 - according to continuous_integration.md https://github.com/starcounter/guidelines/blob/master/continuous_integration.md what is tested automatically: kitchensink develop branch with starcounter rc nightly 2.3 ---- so it is a mess, because we have 3 release channels in starcounter develop, rc and release , 3 branches in starcounter develop, v2.2 and v2.3 and 2 branches in the apps. we propose to remove the branch master in the apps and switch to having the following branches: - develop for sc 2.4 - sc2.3 - sc2.2 the default branch will be the same as what is currently pinned to the download button at starcounter.io. the prs should be made to the develop branch. @starcounter/sc-apps wdyt?
