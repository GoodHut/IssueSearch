 URL : "https://github.com/rnabioco/valr/issues/214" TITLE : speeding up bed_merge BODY : one strategy would be to calculate this operation, which is the key merging step, on the cpp side: r dots <- list .start = ~min start , .end = ~max end then, we can run something like this conditionally on the r side if dots are passed: r if ... { dots <- c dots, lazyeval::lazy_dots ... res <- group_by_ res, .dots = c chrom , .id_merge , x_groups , add = true res <- summarize_ res, .dots = dots } this won't quite work because we would lose vars in the return value from the cpp side. but i like the idea of making things conditional on the dots.
