 URL : "https://github.com/dotnet/project-system/issues/2868" TITLE : path too long BODY : i have a couple of nested git submodules which bring in functionality as part of a distributed angular app. recently, i've started encountering this error: the item metadata % fullpath cannot be applied to the path app\pattern-library ode_modules\material-design-icons\device\ios\ic_signal_cellular_connected_no_internet_0_bar.imageset\ic_signal_cellular_connected_no_internet_0_bar.png . the specified path, file name, or both are too long. the fully qualified file name must be less than 260 characters, and the directory name must be less than 248 characters. i've tried excluding the \app folder from my project as it is only used to build output to be deployed to \wwwroot in an asp.net core project. visual studio won't let me :- this is my project file items: <itemgroup> <content include= config\ \ . copytopublishdirectory= preservenewest /> <content include= wwwroot\ copytopublishdirectory= preservenewest /> <embeddedresource include= _content\ \ . /> <none include= app\ /> </itemgroup> i would have thought <none include= app\ /> would stop it, but it doesn't :- visual studio 2017 15.3.4
