BODY : hello, i recently ran across a bug with the fetch command in pysam. it might be worth checking out. long story short when i try to fetch a chromosome by the tid, it just fetches all reads in the file. samtool = pysam.samfile os.path.join /home/gpratt/projects/idr/analysis/umi_downsampling , 629_clip_s21_l005_r1_001.a03_629_02_uchl5.adaptertrim.round2.rmrep.sorted.adjusted.bam print num reads in chr1 , len list samtool.fetch chr1 tid = samtool.get_tid chr1 print num reads in everything? , len list samtool.fetch tid=tid the output is this: num reads in chr1 1021374 num reads in everything? 23325398 i'm using pysam version 0.10.0, however due to some backwards compatibility issues on with my scripts i'm not using an updated version of samtools and hitslib. currently at versions: samtools 1.2 htslib 1.2.1 i've got my easy workaround just use the chrom name , so its not high priority, but thought i should bring it to your attention. hope its just a bug on my end, but let me know if you can repo it! thank you
