 URL : "https://github.com/micdoodle8/Galacticraft/issues/2717" TITLE : 1.7.10 change request BODY : hello im a bit confused to why the astro miner is because added via getdungeonloot to tier 2 and tier 3 when only tier 1 and 2 are being used in 1.7.10 galacticraft. i've noticed this is causing issues with more planets as when i go to a more planets, planet i get the astro miner schematic as a 50%, when i should be getting a 100% chance of a tier 5 schematic... seems to a bit weird to me that two dungeons offer the chance of the astro miner schematic haha. cc @stevekung
