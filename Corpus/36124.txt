 URL : "https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/ttn/issues/512" TITLE : gateway antenna gain BODY : this is a feature request for the backend. when querying a gateway from the account server at https://account.thethingsnetwork.org/gateways/<gw id> you get an object containing attributes, under which the antenna_model . a more important attribute would be antenna_gain , as this should be use by the gateway to adjust its transmit power to keep to etsi regulations. it could be deducted from the antenna_model , but we can't have a list of all possible antennas and their gains. i therefore recommend adding an antenna_gain field to both the console and the api listed above. perhaps consider removing antenna_model , or use it to automatically fill the antenna_gain for known antennas on the console. note that antenna_gain should have the unit dbi, which means the minimum value would most likely be 2.15dbi 2.15dbi=0dbd . perhaps warn the user when the antenna gain is not filled in, and if the user entered a value below 2.15.
