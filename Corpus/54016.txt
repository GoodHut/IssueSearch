 URL : "https://github.com/jaedb/Iris/issues/148" TITLE : feature request themes BODY : i'm not sure if this feature is already in place, but i'm wondering whether there is a way to create or alter the current theme. personally i find the current one is too 'light' and prefer dark versions. also when using the interface through a mobile, a darker interface will consume less power than a light one, thus increasing battery charge duration. if i can do this by myself, a point to some instructions such as which scss files to change, would be appreciated.
