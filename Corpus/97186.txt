 URL : "https://github.com/stillmuseum/patricia/issues/173" TITLE : forms bug on instill form? BODY : @halfempty we receive complaints from teachers on a regular basis now four total, usually at a rate of one every few weeks , who say they have completed the form on our site: https://clyffordstillmuseum.org/instill-request/ in all of these cases, we have no record of their form submissions. the first few times we assumed it was user error. but because we keep hearing the same thing, we're concerned something is awry. other than sending through test forms, which we can do, is there a more technical / back-end way to research whether or not there is a bug?
