 URL : "https://github.com/brave-intl/publishers/issues/422" TITLE : use webpacker gem BODY : capturing discussion from 348. as noted by @mixonic: > currently the codebase uses rails 5 + sprockets + uglify gem + uglifyjs v1 for production asset compilation. unfortunately uglifyjs v1 is not compatible with modern post-es5 javascript let, => {} functions etc . > adopt the happy path for rails, the webpacker gem. unfortunately this means migrating away from the sprockets build pipeline and related features like importing a file with a comment . this is probably the best direction to head for build pipeline stability if we wanted to continue adding js to the rails app directly.
