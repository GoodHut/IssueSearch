 URL : "https://github.com/croservices/cro-core/issues/3" TITLE : constrain binary dump size BODY : the default message dumping can produce nicely formatted binary output for cro trace . that's nice, until we are building a single page application and spit out a 900kb javascript bundle, which it then spends an age nicely formatting into a hex dump. ain't nobody gonna read that. so, let's put a maximum upper limit on it of 4096 bytes, and if there's more, just stick n bytes not displayed at the end. we can add a cro_trace_max_binary_dump environment variable to let the user raise it if they should really want to, also. discovered because i was building an spa and ran into it. :-
