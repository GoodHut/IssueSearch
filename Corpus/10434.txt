 URL : "https://github.com/msarilar/EDEngineer/issues/294" TITLE : change font size BODY : title pretty much says it all, would love the ability to increase the font size of the shopping list - or a way to export it. i run a 3 27 setup that is really built only for gaming so reading at distance is hard at normal font size. i could use windows scaling but that causes far too many other issues.
