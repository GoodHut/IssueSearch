 URL : "https://github.com/wifiphisher/wifiphisher/issues/570" TITLE : advanced mode BODY : instead of jamming default and --nojamming mode, we should have normal and advanced mode. in normal mode, the user may run wifiphisher with one wireless card and take full advantage of all the features provided through our custom hostapd 569 . obviously, these would be the features related with the rogue access point. in advanced mode, the user will need a second card. the second card will take advantage of our attack modules. these could be deauth, wps, lure10 and new ones. the modular architecture that switch between attacks will look like that: python modules = deauth , wps , lure10 while true: for module in modules: sniff = getattr module, 'sniff' sniff for module in modules: sniff = getattr module, 'action' action
