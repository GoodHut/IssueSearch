 URL : "https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/114" TITLE : nuxt in jvm BODY : many large enterprises will not be running node for a long time. it would be really amazing to have nuxt run in the jvm under nashorm. my question is: how much of nuxt is dependant on v8 api? how much of nuxt is dependant on node api? there are ways to shim/bridge these apis in the jvm and i would be most interested to port nuxt to the jvm if it sounds feasible. i think many enterprises would fancy such a solution.
