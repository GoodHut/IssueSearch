 URL : "https://github.com/DanielCaspers/DigitalInspection/issues/17" TITLE : real time communication BODY : we should evaluate how we could make use of rtc in the app to properly support user tasks without having to worry about concurrent modification, etc. - what situations would we like to have rtc in? concurrent resource modification? notification of status changes to work orders? push notifications to different users as a work order makes its way through its lifecycle? - how would we like to represent this to clients? back to wireframing and contextual inquiry http://www.usabilitynet.org/tools/contextualinquiry.htm . - determine what it would take to integrate signalr https://www.asp.net/signalr/overview/getting-started/introduction-to-signalr into the application. - read example projects to determine what it looks like full stack - provide estimate for feature cost.
