 URL : "https://github.com/liam2/larray/issues/188" TITLE : implement ... in transpose BODY : when you have many dimensions and you only want to change the dimension displayed in columns, it is frustrating to have to list all dimensions. it would be nice to be able to use: python arr.transpose ..., 'time' or arr.transpose 'gender', ..., 'time' an alternative would be to be explicit about the dimension s in columns. something like: python arr.transpose columns='time' or arr.transpose 'gender', columns='time' in the case of several dimensions in columns see 187 , we could use: python arr.transpose columns= 'gender', 'time'
