 URL : "https://github.com/inadarei/hyper/issues/12" TITLE : curies and working links BODY : currently the spec makes the same mistake as hal, mixing the idea of uris for identification, and for dereferencing. i would expect curies strictly to be used so that uri-identified properties can be written in an abbreviated form. however, the spec currently jumps to the idea that i can dereference that uri and get a property's definition/description. that's something entirely different. the spec should be clear about whether properties are simply just identified by uri, and whether there is any assumption about that uri being one that dereferences to a definition/description.
