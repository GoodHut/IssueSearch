 URL : "https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon/issues/1509" TITLE : can not kill system events BODY : for some reasons like lid closing etc., it seems system events stops responding to some applescript commands like setting textfield values etc. i've taken to automatically killing it once i detect this issue. however seems the following lua function killapp ... for _, v in pairs {...} do local app = hs.appfinder.appfromname v if app then app:kill else print no such app .. v end end end killapp system events fails. however in a terminal sh killall -9 'system events' works. i am hacking it for now by actually launching that killall in a shell but would be great if hs app:kill just worked.
