 URL : "https://github.com/storypioneers/kirby-wysiwyg/issues/43" TITLE : issue on save BODY : hi, great plugin! i don't know if it's the expected behavior, but when you save the page, page is refreshed automatically reloaded . before trying this plugin, page updated via $.post & $.get without page reloading and got a friendly green smiley on top right of the viewport. i've tried to hack the wysiwyg.js file but none of my experiments failed. is there a way to tell the plugin to rebind '.btn-submit' events? is it a conflit with mediumeditor.js ?
