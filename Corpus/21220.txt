BODY : nice work. i have a yamaha rx-v475 and was thrilled to see this. how i'd love to access its volume and ideally other settings through my pc. yamaha provide a cool phone app, but nothing for the pc. still, on an initial sally with this i have mixed success. here's the good part: 2017-06-11 17:40:51,430 info 15796:yamahatalker-2 mopidy_yamaha.talker: yamaha amplifier: get device model from host yamaha.lan 2017-06-11 17:40:51,491 info 15796:yamahatalker-2 mopidy_yamaha.talker: yamaha amplifier: found device model rx-v475 2017-06-11 17:40:52,207 info 15796:yamahatalker-2 mopidy_yamaha.talker: yamaha amplifier: volume is 20 102% 2017-06-11 17:40:52,207 info 15796:mainthread mopidy.commands: mixer volume set to 85 and here is the bad: 2017-06-11 17:41:42,372 error 15796:core-8 mopidy.core.mixer: yamahamixer mixer returned bad data: expected a bool instance, not none i was using gnome music player client 11.8.16 over an mpd connection to mopidy though i doubt that is relevant and weirder still, it seems to adjust the volume fine, and i can see the adjust on my phone app even. so it seems an odd error of sorts. i'm also curious if this exposes any more than just volume control. in fact it would be nice it exposed the output device selector and the filter mover often between its 5ch stereo and straight modes and sometimes another . but that is an aside.
