 URL : "https://github.com/RealOrangeOne/react-native-mock/issues/134" TITLE : mock for i18nmanager BODY : hello, i'd like to add a suggestion to create a mock for react.i18nmanager . my team ran into an issue where an oss module was referring it and failed to build during the test runner setup process. our workaround is to import react-native-mock in the runner setup script and assign a i18nmanager mock. however, it would be nice if react-native-mock supported it out of the box.
