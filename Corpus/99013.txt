 URL : "https://github.com/Linaro/mr-provisioner/issues/7" TITLE : mac self-discovery via bmc BODY : some bmcs support reading fru and similar information either via ipmi or a propietary command e.g. over ssh . this could be used to automatically discover machines after their bmc has been added to the ui. this needs a more fleshed out proposal before we can get started on it - if nothing else, to decide which bmcs could be supported and, based on that, what exactly needs to be implemented.
