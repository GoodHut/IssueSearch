 URL : "https://github.com/onikienko/TabHamster/issues/41" TITLE : feature cron/daily backup BODY : as i understand it, tabhamster saves the session when the browser is closed. problem is that since some years i started working on osx, and i never shut down the machine, i just put it to sleep. this makes the backups a lot more less frequent only on updates where a restart is required . i would love for an option where instead i can decide to make the backup daily. p.s.:i've used tabhamster for years and it saved me from mental breakdown several times. for this i want to thank onikienko and the other people that worked on this project.
