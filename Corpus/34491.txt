 URL : "https://github.com/kks32/phd-thesis-template/issues/124" TITLE : choosing a pagestyle BODY : this question came up on tex.stackexchange.com https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/365722/set-the-header-option-in-phd-thesis-template-phdthesispsnpdf-cls . just looking at the readme, i would not know where i have to set the page style. i probably would try \pagestyle{pagestyleii} . maybe you can add a few words to the readme and/or even define the pagestyles with the respective name, which is called by the matching global option. \pagestyle{pagestyleii} would be usable that way.
