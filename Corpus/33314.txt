 URL : "https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/issues/5573" TITLE : add guide to hotkeys BODY : i think this has already been brought up but i can't find an issue so i'm opening one. currently the only way to learn what mastodon's new hotkeys are is to go to the release notes on github. there should be some in-ui guide to the hotkeys, possibly a modal that pops up when you press ? . - x i searched or browsed the repoâ€™s other issues to ensure this is not a duplicate. - x this bug happens on a tagged release https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/releases and not on master if you're a user, don't worry about this .
