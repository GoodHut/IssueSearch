 URL : "https://github.com/Epse/EpPos/issues/26" TITLE : payment system buildout BODY : the pay button should show a dialog box with payment methods. right now i'm not planning on getting any online payment going, but if a client pays by card in-store, that amount should not get added to the cash amount, for example. with our current food-truck-like focus, i think adding card and cash payments as options should be enough.
