 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20465" TITLE : dynamic editor font zoom BODY : i would like to submit a feature request to hold down the ctrl key and use the mouse wheel to zoom text size in and out. basically this would bind ctrl + mouse wheel to dynamically set editor.fontsize . please refer to sublime text, atom, or notepad++ for functional demonstration. this text-zoom feature should not change the size of visual studio code's menu, left side menu, or other ui elements that currently do scale when performing ctrl + , and ctrl - it should only scale the font size in the editor window.
