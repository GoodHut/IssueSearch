 URL : "https://github.com/FAForever/server/issues/271" TITLE : ice: get twilio nts token BODY : to use twilio network traversal service https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/stun-turn properly we need to add a way for the server to generate nts tokens and give them to a client. nts tokens are valid for 24 hours. therefore, i propose the following: 1. add a task to the server that fetches a new nts token from twilio once per hour 2. add a server command nts_token that can be used by any authenticated client and returns the token. we may have to change this to give a separate token to every client, i.e. fetching a new token from twilio for every nts_token request. open questions: should we limit the lifetime of the token? in which ways can this token be abused? can we detect abuse and ban players abusing? i will start with the implementation and push a pr asap.
