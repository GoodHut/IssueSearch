 URL : "https://github.com/cyclejs/cyclejs/issues/739" TITLE : cycle/dom 20.0 bugs BODY : code to reproduce the issue: simple hello world example in this repo for instance expected behavior: should render. actual behavior: does not render. versions of packages used: cycle/dom 20.0 cycle/run 4.0 - - - seems like a showstopper. i'm very surprised that our test suite was all green but this bug still occurred.
