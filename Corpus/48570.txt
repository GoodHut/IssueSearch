 URL : "https://github.com/Facepunch/garrysmod-issues/issues/3327" TITLE : server randomly hangs BODY : my server sometimes randomly freezes. it doesn't crash: no crash logs are created, no errors are thrown, console just stops producing any output and the server must be manually restarted. it happens when game.cleanupmap is being called, but i didn't find any other conditions that might cause this. i've found numerous threads about same or similar issue on facepunch forums: https://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1286685 https://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1415912 https://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1359264 https://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1320466 https://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1572316 i couldn't find any similarities between them but that most but not all of people experiencing this are running ttt servers on linux machines, including me.
