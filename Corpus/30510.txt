 URL : "https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli/issues/804" TITLE : popup closing issue BODY : recently i started facing the issue when popup freezes in the popup closing... state. i investigated and found that when i click save in the popup, it refreshes and i get this error in google chrome console: uncaught syntaxerror: unexpected end of json input at json.parse <anonymous> at popup_response.js:4 at popup_response.js:16 i debugged further and found that document.getelementbyid 'django-admin-popup-response-constants' .dataset.popupresponse , which we pass to the json.parse .. is empty. then i checked view source of the page when it is in the popup closing... state, and html looked like this: <!doctype html> <html> <head><title>popup closing...</title></head> <body> <script type= text/javascript id= django-admin-popup-response-constants src= /static/admin/js/popup_response.js data-popup-response= > </script> </body> </html> for some reason, data-popup-response is always empty. does anyone have ideas on why it started happening and how to fix it?
