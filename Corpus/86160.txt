 URL : "https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js/issues/2089" TITLE : guild.addmember is broken BODY : please describe the problem you are having in as much detail as possible: guild.addmember despite being called with a valid user id, auth token and invoked from a bot where said user authenticated himself with the guilds.join scope, returns an error and doesnt add the member to the server: typeerror: cannot read property 'id' of undefined at object.member c: odecg098 ode_modules\discord.js\src\util\constants.js :154:22 at restmethods.putguildmember c: odecg098 ode_modules\discord.js\src\clie nt\rest\restmethods.js:469:64 at guild.addmember c: odecg098 ode_modules\discord.js\src\structures\guil d.js:509:37 as far as i can see line 469 in restmethods.js is incorrect by specifying the user with user.id instead of just user since constants.js does memberid.id again which is then undefined . on first glance getguildmember has the same issue. replacing user.id with user fixed this issue for me and the member was then correctly added to my server further details: - discord.js version: 11.2.1 - node.js version: 8.7.0 - operating system: windows 7, 64 bit - priority this issue should have â€“ medium
