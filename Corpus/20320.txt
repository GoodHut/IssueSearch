 URL : "https://github.com/enricofer/QgisODK/issues/6" TITLE : cannot import data BODY : using a google drive as a test bed i am unable to sync collected data to a layer in sqlite. i just have 3 basic fields; pkuid, name, and geometry; this is only a test. it builds a xlsx file in my google drive that i can use to manually download and append data but i think it would be slick if i could get the import feature to work. i am not getting an error. if the table is spatially aware i get the import dialog but when i click ok the layer in qgis turns editable and the progress bar goes to 100% but nothing is written to the layer and the dialog stays open with all buttons greyed out. if the layer is not spatially aware then i get the option to select a table and when i select one and hit ok the dialog disappears and nothing more seems to happen. no errors pop up, i think i might be missing a dependency or something. i also have a lot of plugins installed, could that be the issue?
