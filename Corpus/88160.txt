 URL : "https://github.com/fraenkel-lab/GarNet/issues/23" TITLE : motifmap has transfac ids BODY : @amandakedaigle as discussed, we want to make sure we have a coherent list of symbols in garnet's default motif file. we're concerned that motifmap seems to have both genesymbols of tfs and transfac ids. it's unclear to me whether transfac ids are a proper superset of tf gene symbols, subset, or whether they are just two partially overlapping sets. either way, we should hopefully only use one of them, and make sure we can correlate them with the names we're passed in as part of the expression file we receive for tf_regression. - figure out the relationship of transfac id and genesymbol. - email motifmap people asking for rationale of including both transfac id and genesymbol. - repair motifmap file so that the tf_names are from a single namespace.
