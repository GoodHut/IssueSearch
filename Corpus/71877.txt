 URL : "https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/1037" TITLE : amp-compatible mini css? BODY : is it possible to for you @jgthms to generate a minimal, content-only stylesheet that's compatible with accelerated mobile pages amp https://www.ampproject.org/? it will be generic enough it i think it's worth it for bulma to cater to it. amp is basically a content-only, barebones, mobile page. https://www.ampproject.org/docs/guides/responsive/style_pages situation: i use bulma on https://devel.tech, and i want to provide nice fonts/styling/spacing. the issue is the amp standard has limitations. it must be inside a <style> tag, no external css is allowed. there is also prohibited css https://www.ampproject.org/docs/guides/responsive/style_pages disallowed-styles , such as no !important , behavior , or filter . as it stands, i'm doing what you'd expect, taking pieces of bulma and copying it in. i think it'd be a worthwhile thing to have a dist/bulma-amp.css . or a base .scss that would only build the stuff needed in barebones amp styles w/ bulma.
