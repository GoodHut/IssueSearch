 URL : "https://github.com/BuddhistDigitalResourceCenter/owl-schema/issues/21" TITLE : tbrc -> bdrc BODY : a few properties have tbrc in their name placeidtbrc , volumepagestbrcintro , worktbrcholdings , maybe others i think they should be renamed with bdrc btw, you can note a case inconsistency . maybe that's also a good criterium to spot bdrc-specific data that should be moved to the admin: namespace?
