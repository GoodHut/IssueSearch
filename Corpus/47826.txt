 URL : "https://github.com/dabeaz/curio/issues/194" TITLE : py3.5 release on pypi BODY : there have been a number of really important changes recently providing zmq, asyncio bridges and cleanups and speedups to universalqueue and others. is there any chance we can publish a build on pypi with these changes that still includes python 3.5 currently tests pass on 3.5 if you ignore the test_asyncgen file and this can be done pragmatically inside conftest using the following code import sys collect_ignore = if sys.version_info < 3,6 : collect_ignore.append test_asyncgen.py
