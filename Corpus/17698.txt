 URL : "https://github.com/archlinux/arch-boxes/issues/8" TITLE : reduce box's size BODY : i'm trying to make box's size as small as this box https://app.vagrantup.com/wholebits/boxes/archlinux for this, i'm trying to run fstrim in cleanup.sh instead of running dd like in that box https://github.com/wholebits/baseboxes/blob/master/scripts/archlinux.sh l81-l96 . i'm going to test this tonight because i don't have a good internet connection.
