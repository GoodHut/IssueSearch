 URL : "https://github.com/aa65535/openwrt-dist-luci/issues/40" TITLE : signiture check failed. BODY : actually this is issue is not against this repository but the openwrt-dist hosted by sf. recently i find signature check failure on openwrt-dist during opkg update. the packages file i get from sourceforge: b53d1c5af89aab03611d56fd1a092ca8 packages.gz 91593ddd0166f47adfe6c1c3d8286813 packages.sig and the content of the signature file: untrusted comment: signed by key 5c42250627d305bc rwrcqiugj9mfvipg7zisx4eswualqrrnkc38r1okwfjy4x9q38dwygw54jiw0uxcyvuf47v0xchmcnk+lswbfwyrp11jjxxrlwa= and it turns out that the luci-app-chinadns_1.6.1-1_all.ipk file is indeed different between the github version and sourceforge version: a22c3e1a804edb964d66d53c4a99b897 luci-app-chinadns_1.6.1-1_all.ipk.github 810bbe8ae4b668a16d912f47bcb78725 luci-app-chinadns_1.6.1-1_all.ipk.sf is this an attack or some packaging issue? similar signature issue also happens on the base packages. unfortunately i do not have a trusted pre-built binary to compare against this time. is there any chance you could also host pre-built binary in github also? https is more trustable i think. the package list for base packages: fe84704a4e53dd1412402bbb16d8d476 packages.gz 468b961e0651375d1893e39434d54625 packages.sig and the content for the signature file: untrusted comment: signed by key 5c42250627d305bc rwrcqiugj9mfvi361xhmrggzvka5rd4yilhslk4vc2u02io8uzu9mxpa9zmnbud6yl3ena08mzw6zesvrdauljvjk7sthopz2gy= btw, i'm on openwrt chaos_calmer/15.05.1 if this matters.
