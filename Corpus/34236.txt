 URL : "https://github.com/BabylonJS/Editor/issues/18" TITLE : can't build on linux BODY : tried to build it in linux, centos7, but couldn't. i think there is a problem with the electron dependency. i attached the npm log for the master branch. tried both branches, none worked. i'll try to build it on windows. anyway, it's a great work you are doing! i would like to add text in the scene, that would be excellent. thanks, lisandro tapia npm-debug.txt https://github.com/babylonjs/editor/files/961024/npm-debug.txt
