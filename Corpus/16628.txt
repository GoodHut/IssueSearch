 URL : "https://github.com/singularityhub/sregistry/issues/2" TITLE : ldap login option BODY : from a user: our authorization for other systems is entirely built around ldap whenever possible. i think that's quite common for hpc. infosec etc. really want to know how authorization is maintained for different systems - and management at a central ldap directory using ldap groups makes that much more straightforward to keep an eye on, and document the email uniqueness thing goes like this - 'researcher a works in a lab, but also in a core facility. they only have one email address but 2 separate accounts on the hpc system. this is so that their work/data between core and lab can be separated' - so we have many people with 2 usernames sharing same email - and they use our various systems with the 2 different usernames for different work that needs to be separated.
