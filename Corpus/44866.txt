 URL : "https://github.com/MyRobotLab/myrobotlab/issues/77" TITLE : freezes on windows 10 BODY : humanoid reports, runs once then freezes. i re-opened and used mrl again a few times to move some servos then it froze again and i couldn't close it so i had to restart the computer to get rid of it. 'close window' from the start bar wouldn't even get rid of the persistent little bugger. weird. hopefully you can sleuth what's happening. hopefully we can get a myrobotlab.log - and/or someone can replicate the problem ?
