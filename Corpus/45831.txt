 URL : "https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-delayed-message-exchange/issues/97" TITLE : invest in this plugin BODY : because of severe limitations of this plugins in it's current form - cluster and high message count issues - it's not really usable in production. but i would urge team rabbitmq to reprioritize and invest in this plugin by rewriting it or incorporating it in core rabbitmq so that it fixes the issues, because this plugin can bring huge value by letting rabbitmq be used as a distributed ha event/message/process scheduler.
