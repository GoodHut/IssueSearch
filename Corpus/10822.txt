 URL : "https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/issues/6394" TITLE : do not use imap. BODY : using the imap interface creates significant overhead on hxcpp - and possibly all strongly typed targets. since we do not have multiple implementations of imap, the abstraction seems unnecessary. we should certainly remove this unexpected use of an interface from the top-level map class, which appears to be a shourtcut for haxe.ds. map, but in fact is some kind of interface abstraction.
