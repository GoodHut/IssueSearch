 URL : "https://github.com/akhikhl/gretty/issues/365" TITLE : jetty 9.4 support BODY : our team is using gretty for the integration testing and in the local development environment for an application that is deployed on google app engine flexible environment. we would like to be able to use the same jetty version on all environments. unfortunately, this does not seem to be possible as gae flexible is running jetty 9.4 groovy configurations.grettyrunnerjetty93.resolutionstrategy.eachdependency { if requested.group.startswith 'org.eclipse.jetty' && requested.group != 'org.eclipse.jetty.toolchain' { useversion '9.4.5.v20170502' // latest } } gretty startup fails with java.lang.classnotfoundexception: org.eclipse.jetty.server.session.hashsessionmanager . jetty 9.4 upgrade doc indeed mentions https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/9.4.x/upgrading-jetty.html _session_management some changes around session management, so some changes are likely to be required in gretty code base. jetty 9.4 usage is growing https://w3techs.com/technologies/history_details/ws-jetty/9 and by the end of the year it is likely to be more popular than 9.3 between java8+ teams, so adjusting gretty to support it might be worthwhile.
