 URL : "https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/799" TITLE : mpv: enable lua support BODY : lua support is explicitly disabled https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/blob/master/packages/mpv/build.sh l22 in mpv, but mpv has a great library of user created scripts that enhance the functionality. is there a reason for it to be disabled? if it's just to keep dependencies small maybe we can have a mpv-lua subpackage like vim-python .
