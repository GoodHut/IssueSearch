 URL : "https://github.com/mozilla/http-observatory-website/issues/126" TITLE : custom ssh port BODY : before running the ssh observatory test, would it be possible to change the port number that is scanned... use 22 by default, but allow someone to change it. and just to confirm, a non-standard port number does not help with security, it just keeps the access logs a bit clearer, due to the simple bots that keep trying and failing to login.
