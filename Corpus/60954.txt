 URL : "https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/spartan/issues/179" TITLE : add sensors to iiwa sim BODY : add the ability to simulate depth/color sensors in the iiwa drake sim. it should publish out messages via ros, presumably on the pointcloud2 channel. @stonier is this already supported in drake? if so could you point us to an example. it would be nice to be able to dynamically specify the camera location at runtime since it is usually read from a calibration config file.
