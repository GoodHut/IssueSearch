 URL : "https://github.com/u-root/u-root/issues/308" TITLE : tcz does not work BODY : 1. it downloads tcz packages that already exist 2. it will mount on top of older versions 3. it does not create tcloop directories correctly - it spltis on . instead of removing .tcz from the command names - this causes packages to be mounted in the same place i.e. xorg-7.7.tcz and xorg-7.7-bin.tcz both mount to xorg-7 4. it needs a debug flag -d to enable/disable print statements
