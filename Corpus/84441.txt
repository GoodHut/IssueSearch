 URL : "https://github.com/ldaptools/ldaptools-bundle/issues/14" TITLE : custom username attribute BODY : hello, thanks for your awesome bundle. i don't have a username attribute in my users ldap entries; is there a clean way without extending the default user provider because it is actually the only thing i need to change to customize the hardcoded attribute in the loaduserbyusername method of the ldapuserprovider to use uid attribute instead? thanks!
