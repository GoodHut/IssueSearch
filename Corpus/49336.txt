 URL : "https://github.com/jagenjo/Canvas2DtoWebGL/issues/4" TITLE : the benchmark problem BODY : just now, i try it in windows, the all of webgl benchmark is 60fps, but in osx, it really slower than canvas, i read your code, it cache the texture but it call draw method everytime, so i check the inspector result with webgl inspector, i find drawarray too often. the same time, i test the pixi's bunny benchmark example, i find it call drawelement method once and it has prepare module to prevent upload too many textures in one requestanimationframe call. so, it case the benchmark performance bad?
