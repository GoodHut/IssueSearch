 URL : "https://github.com/algolia/docsearch/issues/163" TITLE : request closeonscroll BODY : i had a customer who wanted to be able to use the docsearch on mobile. one of his issue was that the dropdown was taking 80% of the screen, and to close it, the only way he found was to empty the input. even when scrolling the page, on mobile, the dropdown was still present on the page. so, i suggested him to use something like this : $ window .scroll function { if $ window .width < 768 { // if window size is less than 768 or any value your want search.autocomplete.autocomplete.close ; // remove the dropdown search.autocomplete.autocomplete.setval '' ; // clear the input } } ; but then, after a discussion with @pixelastic, we thought it would be a good idea to ask for a closeonscroll implementation. it would be useful to be able to write it with a simple option like that : javascript var search = docsearch { apikey: 'api_key', indexname: 'index_name', inputselector: ' search', debug: false, closeonscroll: true // false by default } ; wdyt ?
