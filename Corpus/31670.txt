BODY : @dwright04 @marco-willi relevant line https://github.com/zooniverse/hco-experiments/blob/7f98c0e8a3d0f4129fc6b60b275ffb43cd40ecd6/swap/swap/agents/subject.py l14 the constructor of a subject currently requires a gold label is passed. how do we handle the subjects that don't have a gold label, and should it be required to pass a gold label in such isntances? would it be better to 1. have a default value in the constructor for unlabeled subjects or 2. have a separate method to set the gold label. this is relevant for the test/train split as the gold label is stripped from some subjects, and for the 'real world' once swap is applied to nero.
