 URL : "https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/issues/914" TITLE : double input handling BODY : when i start the console and then select an input field from the game option, the keyboard input is put in the textfield and the console. we currently have 3 input handler. one for qt, one for the normal keybindings and one for the console. they are called in that order in engine.h:359 for auto &action : this->on_input_event { if false == action->on_input &event { break; } } it looks like the handler can return false to indicate that they handled the input. strangely, input/input_manager.cpp:381 always returns true. i guess we need to unselect the textfield when the console is set visible/clicked on. why does the qt input manager return true if it handled the key? another problem is that console::register_to_engine.h registers to be used to hide the console, but when pressing it, it is taken as literal text input to the console.
