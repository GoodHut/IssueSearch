 URL : "https://github.com/dragan224/battle_cats_en_combos/issues/3" TITLE : add column for combo stat BODY : it would be a neat thing if the cat combo filter told you also the amount of the effect. check out this page in the bc wiki: http://battle-cats.wikia.com/wiki/cat_combo it shows the amounts for each effect. the cat combo filter could have one more column for the amount of the effect increase. thanks for listening!
