 URL : "https://github.com/minio/minio/issues/4866" TITLE : disallow admin setconfig BODY : this came as a requirement during discussion for cloud foundry. but it is not related to cf in particular. when access/secret keys are set through env vars, currently we allow setconfig through admin api even when the config's access/secret mismatch with the ones set through env vars . this should be disallowed. i.e adminapihandlers.setconfighandler should return error when config's creds mismatch with the ones set through env vars.
