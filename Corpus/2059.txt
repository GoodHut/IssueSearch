 URL : "https://github.com/EastCoastGreenwayAlliance/ecg-map/issues/13" TITLE : routing & ux BODY : the ux flow for routing is as follows: 1. user searches for a location 2. app displays the result and shows the user the nearest ecg segment point to it 3. user chooses this as a start point and wanders either north or south; or user chooses to search for an endpoint 4. if the latter, then step 2 happens again 5. if the former the map zooms & pans to that location on the ecg so we will have to break out some of the routing logic for finding the nearest ecg segment to a geocoded search. cc @gregallensworth
