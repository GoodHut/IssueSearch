BODY : firstly - is learnyounode the second batch of exercises in the set? i worry i've gone from 1 to 4 or something second - i am trying to run the below solution but it fails for i = 2, sum = 0; i <= process.argv.length; i++ { num = number process.argv i ; sum += num; } console.log sum ; third - is there a way to view the correct answer so i don't have to come online to ask - giving me much shame fourth - thanks to everyone who put this site and exercises together! i always wonder what motivates such generosity! some day maybe i will be in a position to pay it forward... till then i'm kind of a confused newbie. enthusiastic and persistent but not particularly talented!
