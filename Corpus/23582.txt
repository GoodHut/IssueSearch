 URL : "https://github.com/mauzel/mproxy-gbf/issues/5" TITLE : proxy and cookies? BODY : as of https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=369911, chrome does not send any cookies through proxies of any sort. when using mproxy-gbf, this creates problems with language settings and likely with login info too. while i realize mproxy-gbf has no ways to fix this short of handling cookies itself - very hacky i'm wondering if there isn't a workaround; for example, a specially crafted pac file to send only cacheable assets requests through the proxy, and if you wouldn't have pointers on how to achieve that?
