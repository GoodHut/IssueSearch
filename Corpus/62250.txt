 URL : "https://github.com/mcenderdragon/Futurepack-API/issues/197" TITLE : charging research table BODY : hey there, not sure if this is intentional but the charging of a researcher is in a really slow rate tried out too put more energy modules on a researcher and powered them all. result was, the research took all the needed energy into its block so no more energy supply was needed, but it still took like 15min to actually fill the research bar until the real progress on the timer kicked in. so... i m not sure if time is just ment to be a resource on the time bar or maybe on energy bar too but it definetly feels wrong! and if intentional, maybe leave a note somewhrere? i didnt find one on energy charge time :/ thx alot
