 URL : "https://github.com/wireapp/wire-webapp/issues/830" TITLE : screen sharing in linux BODY : wire is pretty awesome, but for it to be useful for my work, i need to be able to share my screen from my linux desktop. i'm happy to offer some trouble-shooting/debugging help on this one, but i'm afraid my javascript-foo is not up to the task of implementing this myself.
