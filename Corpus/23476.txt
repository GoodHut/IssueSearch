 URL : "https://github.com/videolang/video/issues/36" TITLE : port-based io api? BODY : it might be useful for video to provide a way to read and write video data to and from arbitrary racket ports, instead of only to and from files. i think a possible way to support this would be for clip to accept an input port from which it reads video data. maybe it would have to be a thunk that produces a port though? i'm not sure how lazy video construction is or when exactly the file is read into memory.
