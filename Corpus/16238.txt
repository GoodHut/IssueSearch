 URL : "https://github.com/reverse-shell/routersploit/issues/231" TITLE : idea to implement BODY : maybe it is a good idea to implement a default password/login on routers that have port 80 or 443 or even 8080 open to the web , using hydra . a simple shell script commanded by main app which makes router auto-detection brand with nmap and then use hydra on http or https to test . in this option could also be interesting an option to user passwords file , where hydra run them all . this way router exploit will not be dependent only on routers that have exploits to use .
