 URL : "https://github.com/Wynncraft/Issues/issues/7624" TITLE : can't press buttons BODY : if this is an april fools prank, i'm not amused. every time i press a button, i get the message 'you don't have permission to do that in this area.' i can't progress in quests or do dungeons if i can't press buttons.
