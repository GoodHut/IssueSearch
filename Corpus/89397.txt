 URL : "https://github.com/pingidentity/lua-resty-openidc/issues/45" TITLE : proxy support for openidc BODY : hi, we've got lua-resty-openidc working, and are now trying to get it to work in an environment that requires all traffic to go through an outbound proxy. we are getting a connection refused error when trying to access the discovery url. we have installed the lua-resty-socket module but we're amateurs at lua. could you point us in the right direction to get openidc to use a proxy?
