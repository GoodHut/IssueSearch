BODY : --segments the number of segments in the cluster. the default is 2. we recommend one for each cpu core in the cluster as a good starting point. higher numbers tend to consume more resources, but may result in increased performance. i'm having troubles understanding what a segment is. i also can't seem to find documentation about this. could somebody please explain what is a 4store segment?
