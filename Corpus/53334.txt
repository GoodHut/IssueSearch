 URL : "https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/1299" TITLE : doc bug in rb-nutshell BODY : from rt 131269 https://rt.perl.org/ticket/display.html?id=131269 : > on https://docs.perl6.org/language/rb-nutshell, it says: > > > no space allowed before the opening parenthesis of an argument list. > > > > foo 3, 4, 1 ; not right in ruby or perl 6 in perl 6 this would > > try to pass a single argument of type list to foo > > foo 3, 4, 1 ; ruby and perl 6 > > foo 3, 4, 1; ruby and perl 6 - alternative parentheses-less style > > > this doc was probably written before the glr, because even if the ‘foo ’ version does produce a > single argument of type list, then the “single argument rule” makes it behave the same as the others. > > another bug, further down the the file is: > > > > perl6 example.p6 --length=abc > > usage: > > c.p6 --length=<int> --file=<any> --verbose > > > clearly that’s a copy-pasto, since the file can’t be named c.p6 and example.p6 both at the same time.
