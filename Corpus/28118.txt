 URL : "https://github.com/TheRealDF/KronoriumApp/issues/7" TITLE : feature reddit feed BODY : this would essentially be a multi-reddit feed in-app, putting all new posts from each call of duty subreddit into a feed. opening a post would either open the reddit app, or open in the device browser. this could be achieved via post webhooks. don't allow the user to see the body of the post in-app, to be sure no traffic is taken away from the subreddits.
