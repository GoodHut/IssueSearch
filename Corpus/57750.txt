 URL : "https://github.com/sreedhar7/ember-app-scheduler/issues/7" TITLE : release 0.1.0 version? BODY : there are a few reasons for this bump: it allows consumers to depend on ember-app-scheduler via ^ caret dependency. which means they can automatically get patch version bumps if we have bugs that need fixing. it signifies that a breaking change has occurred talking about dropping support for node < 4 in my last pr . any objections?
