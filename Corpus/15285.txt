_originally opened as https://github.com/lukesdm/image-comments/issues/9_ ---- this is a really interesting concept. it might be worth investigating in what it'd take to support embedding the images via data uris. this would result in larger source files, but the comments would be self contained. since the comment would be self contained, it should be possible to embedded images from the fs more easily. anway, neat idea, good luck.
