 URL : "https://github.com/klaftertief/elm-search/issues/18" TITLE : allow searching on modules BODY : modules are currently very hard to discover. let's say i want to find the functions contained in the module 'list'. there is currently no way to do this: the only way to find it is to guess the right package on elm package search and find it from there. i'd instead like to be able to search on list , and have an entry returned linking to http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.0.0/list . furthermore, as a submodule list.extra exists in elm-community/list-extra , an entry for that should be returned as well.
