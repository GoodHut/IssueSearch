 URL : "https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-pc/issues/1613" TITLE : stats & isolated streams BODY : while doing a first pass at a security review https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-stats/issues/99 issuecomment-331979041 for webrtc stats, i noticed the text on isolated media streams in webrtc 1.0 leaves open the access to stats for them: > in particular, the statistics that rtcpeerconnection records are not reduced in capability. new statistics that might compromise isolation must be avoided, or explicitly suppressed for isolated streams. it sounds like stats might leak a lot about isolated streams to the javascript layer, so @aboba suggested i raise an issue so that we look more closely into this.
