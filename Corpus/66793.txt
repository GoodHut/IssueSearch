 URL : "https://github.com/blakeembrey/node-immigration/issues/25" TITLE : no issue just a thanks! BODY : hi, i'm the author of klei-migrate https://github.com/klei/migrate and have been needing support for storage adaptors for it in quite some time but haven't found the time to build it. on my hunt for another migration tool with such support i found this module and it perfectly suits my needs! : what makes the switch really easy is the fact that both immigration and klei-migrate uses the same module format for migration files and klei-migrate 's files are correctly recognized and run by immigration . so i just want to say thanks! ps. i will probably build an sql adaptor for immigration really soon so i'll update 23 if i'm the first :
