 URL : "https://github.com/ros/pluginlib/issues/50" TITLE : how to load multi-library BODY : i am trying to use ros::pluginlib to load a plugin called a_plugin which has been registered to ros package system correctly. one thing to note is that a_plugin depends on opensplice dds, and it need to link the dds libraries libddskernel.so , libdcpsisocpp.so . in cmakelists.txt file, i write like this: add_library a_plugin src/aplugin.cpp target_link_libraries a_plugin $env{ospl_home}/lib/libddskernel.so $env{ospl_home}/lib/libdcpsisocpp.so it can be registered to ros package system correctly, but when i use pluginlib::classloader to load a_plugin, i got the following errors:terminate called after throwing an instance of 'pluginlib::createclassexception'what : multilibraryclassloader: could not create object of class type test::a_plugin as no factory exists for it. make sure that the library exists and was explicitly loaded through multilibraryclassloader::loadlibrary . how can i solve this problem? thanks!
