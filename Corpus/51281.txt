 URL : "https://github.com/cpdevelops/simple.css/issues/4" TITLE : adding more components BODY : this is more of a large scale issue, where anyone can help contribute. currently, the only component in the framework is buttons which still need work . here are a list of components that would be great to have added, but feel free to add whatever you feel would work well. i will make sure that your changes fit the style of simple.css with the proper class name styling and such, but feel free to take creative freedom. here is the list of components that would be good to have added: - grid see bootstrap's grid system https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/ - code blocks - styled tables - images - lists - alerts - forms - navigation bar most of these have been inspired by the bootstrap https://getbootstrap.com/ framework, but feel free to suggest more components in this issue! i will continue to update this issue with all the components as they are suggested and added, and i hope to see this project improve and grow. thanks for the help and happy coding!
