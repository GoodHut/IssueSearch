 URL : "https://github.com/RTcmix/RTcmix/issues/12" TITLE : compiling on ubuntu 17.04 BODY : trying to build the maxmsp version on linux g++ ubuntu 6.3.0-12ubuntu2 6.3.0 so i work on updating rtcmix~ on pd and i get a couple of errors: make 3 : entering directory '/home/jwmatthys/audio/rtcmix/insts/std/lpcplay' g++ -wno-deprecated -i. -i/home/jwmatthys/audio/rtcmix/include -o2 -wall -wno-unused -fpic -dlinux -m64 -dstandalone -i. -duse_headers -c -o stabilize.o stabilize.cpp stabilize.cpp: in function ‘double abs double ’: stabilize.cpp:31:27: error: ‘double abs double ’ conflicts with a previous declaration inline double abs double x { return x >= 0. ? x : -x; } ^ in file included from /usr/include/c++/6/math.h:36:0, this one is easily fixed by commenting out line 37 of stabilitze.cpp. i don't know if other compilers aren't pulling in stdlib or are missing abs seems unlikely . maybe an ifdef is needed? i know lpcplay is an old instrument; maybe this line of code can safely be removed. the other issue i get is: in file included from minc.y:12:0: lex.yy.c: in function ‘int mm_yy_get_next_buffer ’: minc.l:41:80: error: cannot convert ‘int ’ to ‘yy_size_t {aka long unsigned int }’ for argument ‘2’ to ‘int readfromglobalbuffer char , yy_size_t , int ’ define yy_input buf,bytes,maxbytes readfromglobalbuffer buf,& bytes ,maxbytes i'm afraid that flex stuff is a black box to me. any suggestions on fixing this? thanks!
