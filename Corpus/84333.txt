 URL : "https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/issues/2283" TITLE : cross compilation presets BODY : i'm not sure this is a good idea, maybe meson could be shipped with cross compilation presets on linux distributions. for example on fedora, there are mingw, arm linux/none compilers, etc. so while calling meson like this: meson srcdir builddir --cross-file mingw32 meson could look into two path, the current one and and a global one like /etc/meson.d/. that may help new comers. the difficulties i see here are: - who provides this files meson or the distribution? - when installing with pip one other solution would be to share them on github.
