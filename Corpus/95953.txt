 URL : "https://github.com/p-rupert/p-rupert.github.io/issues/1" TITLE : domain mapping not working BODY : hi, i recently built a page on github and had an old site at wordpress. the site peterrupert.com however is not working. here is the response i received from wordpress: i checked your domain, and i do see that the two a records pointing to 192.30.252.153 and 192.30.252.154. if you're seeing an error message generated by github, though, that means the domain is properly mapped to github, but the site isn't configured properly. as such, there are two things you'll want to look at right now: 1 double-check that you have the right ip addresses for your site. some hosts offer multiple ip addresses that can vary from site to site. 2 check the configuration of your site. you may need to contact github for support on this. either way, the domain is definitely mapped to github at this point. i hope that helps, and let me know if you have any questions with anything else!
