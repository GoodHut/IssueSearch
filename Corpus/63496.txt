 URL : "https://github.com/citybound-old/comp-geo/issues/1" TITLE : earcut function missing BODY : hi @aeickhoff i'm trying to port over your comp geo for my own purposes. i've gotten the skeleton built but the way to triangulate that is still a mystery. it looks like there's some missing stuff in shape.js where it's referring to earcut however that's not in any of the repositories. although, i'm not even sure if you're using that to triangulate a skeleton either. anyhow, if you have more of your old js code i would love to see them as reference. good luck on cb rust version!
