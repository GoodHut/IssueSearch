 URL : "https://github.com/idyll-lang/idyll/issues/121" TITLE : idyll: how does it work? BODY : since i've mostly worked on the tooling side of things, the inner workings of interactivedocument are still a bit of a mystery to me. hopefully @mathisonian can drop some knowledge here to help me with my refactorings, but i think a good overview would also be good to have in the docs/site. specifically, i'm not clear on the following bits that are specific to idyll, and not native react concepts. - getchildren https://github.com/idyll-lang/idyll/blob/master/packages/idyll-document/src/index.js l41 - handleupdateprops nodeid https://github.com/idyll-lang/idyll/blob/master/packages/idyll-document/src/index.js l46 - setstateandderived newstate https://github.com/idyll-lang/idyll/blob/master/packages/idyll-document/src/index.js l65 , which is called by code generated in the node walker https://github.com/idyll-lang/idyll/blob/master/packages/idyll-document/src/visitors/node.js l105 . i think i'm missing the key insight of exactly _how_ the reactive changes are triggered and propagated through the document.
