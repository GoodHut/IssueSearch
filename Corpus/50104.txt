 URL : "https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/issues/230" TITLE : viewbox not supported BODY : i am pulling in svgs from an external source, so i can't control them. i noticed skiasharp doesn't handle svgs that don't have a height/width and, even if that's set correctly, the viewbox isn't being accurately used. for instance, some have a negative starting point e.g. viewbox= -100 -100 400 400 . i have to set height/width to 500 since that's technically the size , but i still end up cutting off 100px and having an extra 100px of nothing on the end. is this a known issue?
