 URL : "https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib/issues/821" TITLE : bitcoin core / webassembly BODY : i know that bitcoinjs is a mature and very high-quality library, and i've had a good experience when working with it in the past, so i'm just throwing this idea out there with no expectation that it necessarily makes any sense. has any thought been given to selectively replacing the internals with parts of bitcoin core compiled to webassembly? possible benefits: performance again, just possibly â€” this may very well not be the case additional resistance to side channel attacks on the crypto wasm wouldn't fully mitigate this, but implementations are expected to be similar to native c compile targets or possibly the jvm in terms of timing characteristics, which is theoretically superior to standard js runtimes ensured consistency with bitcoin core logic and any possible future changes segwit, hard fork, etc. no idea how relevant those particular examples are this isn't really a feature request or a suggestion; just mentioning the idea in case there are any problems it would help solve that it hadn't been considered as a solution for.
