 URL : "https://github.com/ebas-submission-tool/troubleshooting/issues/5" TITLE : file name changed BODY : the submit tool keeps informing me that the file name was changed. at the beginning if was my problem because i did not use all fields. however, now i include all fields that i can identify. the 9th field is the instrument name. the nilu web site only limits the character set and i traditionally use smps_kos . the gaw wdca web site requires the name formatted as manufacturer_model_id but the submit tool does not complain about the file name line in the headers but only changes the 9th field of the file name to cz03l_smps_kos . this does not conform to any convention known to me. should i ignore it or should i rename the instrument and resubmit the older files with the new name or is it a bug in the submit tool?
