 URL : "https://github.com/thoughtbot/administrate/issues/855" TITLE : admin model in rails app BODY : feature suggestion if you have admin model in your project it can be really annoying that administrate have admin as a module too. so it could be a nice improvement if during running a rails generate administrate:install generator will stop and tell you that you have a admin model, which will intersect with admin module in gem.
