 URL : "https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/8307" TITLE : python folding is bad BODY : good folding see vim, pycharm with ideavim, or org-mode for a decent implementation of folding. unfold one level, and the levels below it remain folded, giving you an outline. evil folding unfolding a region unfolds all sub-regions. this basically ruins any benefit of folding. origami folding folds are only one-level deep. methods inside of classes, for example, are not fold-able. solution? i don't know how people can browse code without proper folding. is there some navigation method i'm missing? people said that origami is better than evil, but origami can't even fold class methods - am i missing something?
