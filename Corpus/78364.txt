 URL : "https://github.com/nowsecure/r2frida/issues/78" TITLE : problem with android arm BODY : i managed to get r2frida working on my macos box but it looks like there's something wrong when attaching to a process on the android device arm 32 bit . running something like r2 frida://0658d32xxxxxxx/xxx.domain.myapp actually seems to do something as it's attaching to the frida-server on the device but i end up with an r2 instance that is a t 0x00000000 and has all registers at zero and it looks like it's not even talking to the remote process. is there any way to debug what's going wrong? cheers!
