 URL : "https://github.com/jrudolph/sbt-dependency-graph/issues/134" TITLE : sbt 1.0 release BODY : is there a plan to release an sbt 1.0 compatible plugin? https://github.com/jrudolph/sbt-dependency-graph/issues/132 is related. i had a quick look regarding the sbt-dependency-graph build and found that sbt-pgp 1.1.0-m1 supports sbt 1.0. i raised https://github.com/sbt/sbt-scalariform/issues/64. there seems to be more required for the sbt scripted-plugin than just uptaking org.scala-sbt scripted-plugin_2.12;1.0.0. i've tried the sbt-coursier plugin and it does work but it doesn't have the same features as this plugin.
