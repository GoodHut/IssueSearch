 URL : "https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/PostProcessing/issues/304" TITLE : near/far plane for dof BODY : what happened? dof is harder to setup than earlier. post-processing stack version v1, v2 ? v2 unity version, operating system, target platform standalone windows, mac, ios, ps4... ? windows. in earlier versions before the new post processing stack you could set the distance of the near and far-plane. also falloff and blur size for each plane. that was way easier to setup than dealing with aperture and focal length. 1 are there any plans to introduce this much easier workflow again? 2 is it possible to calculate focus distance, aperture and focal length manually from a given near/farplane + falloff ? if so, how?
