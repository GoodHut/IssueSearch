 URL : "https://github.com/dnanexus-rnd/dxWDL/issues/77" TITLE : dx-docker pull speed BODY : i'm seeing some somewhat erratic docker image pull times for workflows executed by dxwdlrt. typical pull time seems to be about 3-4mins which seems par for the course i can achieve 2.5-3 minute pulls of my image on a gce or aws instance running coreos . but every once in a while, a dnanexus job will take 20 or sometimes even 40 mins just to pull the docker image example: job-f8g5kyq09y3bjyjqb23xjgbq . do you have /var/lib/docker pointing to a local ephemeral disk mount, or is it on an ebs/root volume? or maybe dx-docker doesn't use a daemon, but it must be saving / unpacking the aci somewhere in my own attempts to time pull behavior outside of dnanexus, it seems that docker pull speed has almost nothing to do with available network bandwidth, but is either bound by disk i/o speed which might be at play here or the inherent lameness of gzip the latter of which is more predictable and doesn't explain this behavior .
