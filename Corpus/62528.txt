 URL : "https://github.com/sorich87/bootstrap-tour/issues/651" TITLE : conditionally skip step BODY : is there a way to supply a callback to a step to determine whether the step should be displayed or not? for instance if the webpage is in a specific state that is more complex than can be detected using element and orphan skipping? i expected the onshow handler to skip a step if returning a falsey value, but the return seems to be ignored. p.s. onshow documentation lists only the first argument. the second argument 0-based index of step is not documented .
