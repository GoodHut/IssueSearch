 URL : "https://github.com/tgriesser/knex/issues/2390" TITLE : timeout in 0.14.2 BODY : environment knex version: 0.14.2 database + version: postgres 9.5.10 os: osx/windows bug 1. explain what kind of behaviour you are getting and how you think it should do after 5 minutes or so of inactivity, subsequent requests to the database timeout. i'd expect this to not be the case. reverting to knex 0.13.0 resolves the issue. 2. error message receiving an etimedout message from the server. 3. reduced test code, for example in https://npm.runkit.com/knex or if it needs real database connection to mysql or postgresql, then single file example which initializes needed data and demonstrates the problem. i don't have a test case at the moment. i wanted to see if anyone else is experiencing the problem. i'm curious if this is an issue with the 3.x version of generic-pool, which knex 0.14.x uses.
