 URL : "https://github.com/keif888/SSISMHash/issues/8" TITLE : sql 2016 sp1 support BODY : hi keith, reading the changelog history since 1.6.6.4 where you started supporting sql 2016 _rtm_ i don't see any mention for sql 2016 _sp1_. our new sql 2016 environment is up-to-date sp1 cu4 and will be following an strict updating policy, so before installing i just wanted to be sure that your latest version solution is supported or on the contrary, if you need to test and especifically support any new sp or cu as those are being released. thanks for your time and the great work.
