 URL : "https://github.com/isula/Home/issues/1" TITLE : os builder server BODY : we have a problem that we need to build an os/base-image by hand and then submit to a server. since the build and submit process depend heavily on the cloud server gce we are using and the network is terrible, it might be better to have a build server. besides the network issue, the auto-build is a must done job. it was in our plan and i prefer to rise the priority. i'll start a draft about a 'simple build server' project in this issue.
