 URL : "https://github.com/myint/launchpad-test/issues/107" TITLE : tests depend on unittest2 BODY : the dependency on unittest2 causes problems when trying to run the tests for python 3 at package build time in debian and ubuntu. we don't have a python3-unittest2 package available. iiuc, upstream unittest2 doesn't support python 3 anyway; that's available in a separate package called: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/unittest2py3k but that's not available in debian. is the dependency on unittest2py3k really necessary for python 3? is it possible to conditionally import unittest2 only when running in python 2?
