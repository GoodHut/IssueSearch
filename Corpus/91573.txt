 URL : "https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7-Website/issues/41" TITLE : typo on custom build page BODY : looks like there's a minor typo on the custom build page: <http://framework7.io/docs/custom-build.html available-components-modules> in the available components table, the pull to refresh link _looks_ duplicated; the href is correct, but the text it wrong. it should say infinite scroll instead... i think?
