 URL : "https://github.com/BullOak/BullOak/issues/11" TITLE : update end-to-end tests BODY : description --- to be sure that the overall behaviour of our system does not change, we will rely on bdd when for the functional refactor. this means that we need to reword the specflow tests to reflect the correct new usage and then refactor the step implementations to meet the interface to be exposed by our infrastructure. proposal --- as mentioned above, just reword the steps based on expected new usage. for each one, create another issue, keeping this one under development. benefits --- acceptance tests make sure that the expected overall behaviour does not change and also makes sure that usage is clearly documented. risks --- there is the possibility that a rewrite would have be better than gradual refactor due to the huge amount of changes.
