 URL : "https://github.com/zurb/foundation-emails/issues/826" TITLE : mailchimp merge tags BODY : <!-- please only file bugs with foundation on github. if you've got a more general question about how to use foundation, we can help you on the foundation forum: http://foundation.zurb.com/forum --> in mailchimp you can use merge tags so they are editable in the template. the only issue i have is when using buttons - if i do this for example: <row> <columns large= 6 > <center> <button mc:edit= recipe_link_2 href= >view recipe</button> </center> </columns> </row> unfortunately it wipes out the mc:edit once it's compiled so i have to go and insert it manually. i was just wondering if you anyone else has come across this? thanks!
