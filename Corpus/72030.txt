 URL : "https://github.com/TextureGroup/Texture/issues/182" TITLE : astablenode custom width BODY : _from @psk239 on january 31, 2017 18:9_ i am using an asviewcontroller to display an astablenode and i would like for the width to be different for an ipad screen vs an iphone screen i.e. 540 pt max width . i posted on general in the slack channel and was told to try style.preferredsize either in the init or viewdidload and nothing really changed, the astablenode is still full width. here is sample code of what i am trying: obj-c @implementation sampleviewcontrollerclass //<- this is a subclass of asviewcontroller - instancetype init { _tablenode = astablenode alloc initwithstyle:uitableviewstyleplain ; // this isn't the actual value, just trying to see if anything changes _tablenode.style.preferredsize = cgsizemake 100.0f, 400.0f ; if self = super initwithnode:_tablenode { // some config code here } return self; } @end i've also tried setting tablenode.style.preferredlayoutsize , tablenode.style.maxwidth , and tablenode.style.width in both the init and viewdidload methods and nothing changed. would appreciate any help. _copied from original issue: facebookarchive/asyncdisplaykit 2957_
