 URL : "https://github.com/geoffhumphrey/brewcompetitiononlineentry/issues/787" TITLE : emails were not sending BODY : i was having problems with emails not sending to any google account. i found that it was erroring because the system was trying to specify two from: addresses. this was caused because the competition name had a comma in it and that was causing a weird split and creating the problem. once i removed the comma it started working correctly. it would be great to have more control over all the email settings, maybe that is something you can work into an upcoming release.
