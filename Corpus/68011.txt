 URL : "https://github.com/ticofab/reactive-kraken/issues/12" TITLE : refactor + new features BODY : hy! i start to work on this codebase, and if you want to, i will pr my modifications. i made a quick tour in the code, and i want to make some changes like; - split the kraken actor to public and private part so we can ratelimit the private requests in the future . - after the split the it tests from the public part can get a new spec and can be run without api keys - i want to make some object/companion-object reorganization too mostly for the smaller case-classes - i didn't run throught the whole code, but i want to implement all the public api i have no idea if there are missing ones or not, but i want to cover it - i want to implement trade history the reason i wanted to find a lib at the beginning :d - implement a throttler actor for the private request what can count the rate limits, and hold requests if needed these will cover some of the already opened issues. i thought about to just solve them, but at the beginning i want to split your main actor.
