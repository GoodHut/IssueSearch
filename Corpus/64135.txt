 URL : "https://github.com/beerjson/beerjson/issues/12" TITLE : fix fermentation stages BODY : a long standing beerxml issue is that it has no way to represent stepped or ramped fermentation profiles. i suggest moving to an array of fermentation steps, each with a start and end temperature and a duration. this is how i represent fermentation profiles in my fermentation control software. we might need to add a transfer counter to represent primary, secondary etc. this leaves an issue about how to represent free rise, which i don't have an answer for.
