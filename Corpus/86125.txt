 URL : "https://github.com/radare/radare2/issues/9097" TITLE : graphic view for sections BODY : maybe is me the one that does not know how to do it, or it truly isn't implemented. i would suggest a graphical view of the sections. my struggle is that i must continuously increase the offset for: pd <offset> section.<name> it would be much easier to be able to do it the same way we do it with functions: vv and just press the down arrow key to scroll threw the section itself. i hope this also sounds like a good idea for you guys and if not, sorry to bother.
