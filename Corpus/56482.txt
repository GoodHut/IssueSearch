 URL : "https://github.com/DuckHunt-discord/DHV2/issues/46" TITLE : new argument for !coin BODY : an additional argument to _ !coin _, like _ !coin channelname _ or similar would do that. why i find it useful, you may ask... well, when you want to surprise some users on that channel or make a special or give them some extra ducks, you cannot do that without a message from yourself right before the duck message, so it would be better to hide that and bring some coins in from a different in my case private channel.
