 URL : "https://github.com/easydigitaldownloads/edd-free-downloads/issues/158" TITLE : conflict with livereload BODY : this is not big issue. just bringing this to your attention. i'm using livereload with a wordpress install locally. it works fine until installing edd free downloads. the issue is simply the css file name. wordpress default stylesheet for themes is style.css . edd free download stylesheet is also style.css . livereload doesn't work when two files of the same name are linked/embeded on the same page.
