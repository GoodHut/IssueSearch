BODY : during homing and once the endstop is hit, remaining path segments are not removed from the pru buffer. that way, it looks like the endstop is hit and then it remains at the location where it was hit, and stays there for several seconds. this might be because long segments have to be chopped up and so when the endstop is hit, only the currently active path is removed.
