 URL : "https://github.com/chrisguindon/eclipsefdn-docker/issues/1" TITLE : credentials are wrong BODY : your docker-compose.yml file has incorrect default credentials and it won't work on my mysql instance. the credentials should match my instance: environment: mysql_root_password: k 4se38d$i6l2d mysql_password: trustmeimaprofessional mysql_user: edouardpoitras mysql_database: phpapp1 you should also consider adding the internet-accessible host information for the mysql instance, such as mine: mysql_host: 208.76.122.5 this works well for me - see my website: https://epoitras.com thank you.
