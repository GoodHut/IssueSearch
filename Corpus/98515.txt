 URL : "https://github.com/manyminds/api2go/issues/300" TITLE : is this correct behaviour? BODY : i stumbled upon this: https://github.com/manyminds/api2go/blob/master/api_interfaces_test.go l335 https://github.com/manyminds/api2go/blob/master/api_interfaces_test.go l440 which seems to have slipped through our eyes. every tests checks for 405 even though the description state 404 except the first one for create. we should investigate what's happening here. if you ask me, every route should return 405 if the route is registered but the method is not.
