 URL : "https://github.com/brocaar/loraserver/issues/197" TITLE : jwt error with curl? BODY : okay... some back story. 1: i tried to use mosquitto_sub command mosquitto_sub -t application/ appname / -v to view what's published, but i couldn't find the app number. i tried using the application name, and nothing is showing up. 2: so i'm trying to find a list of applications with the grpc api via curl i copied the command from the web interface but jwt isn't liking my authentication? i used the base64 jwt random from my /etc/default config as the value for the grpc-metadata-authorization object. { error : authentication failed: jwt parse error: token contains an invalid number of segments , code :16} so am i missing something? thanks!
