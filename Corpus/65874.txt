 URL : "https://github.com/d-ganchar/flask_request_validator/issues/24" TITLE : list of changes for v.2 BODY : 1. remove type and required rules. i don't think is rules. this is logic which should works before rules. you need think about a format of initialization param . here an example which will be shorter: param post, str, true, rules... type of param, type of variable, required or not, other rules... 2. improve error messages. they should be more informative. 3. add validation of raw json request.get_json . you should think about a new type of param . currently we have next types: get , post , view . i don't like it. can be need to combine post form data + json raw json in body and get + view types? i didn't decide which way will better, but i don't like the current implementation. you need to research it. 4. implementation of view mapper. i think is good way to set all parameters as arguments to view function. you need to think about priority and how it should works. @validate_params param 'price', post, type float , required , param 'city', post , def route price, city : in this case get_request_value and flaskrequest are not needed.
