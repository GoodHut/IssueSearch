 URL : "https://github.com/SickRage/SickRage/issues/3457" TITLE : custom css feature BODY : being using sickrage for a couple a months now, and really enjoying it. i was wondering if there is a custom css feature in the planning. i don't really like the current color scheme and was hoping to change it and importantly keep the changes when upgrading. a option under settings -> general -> advanced settings with an input text field where custom css can be placed. keep up the good work!
