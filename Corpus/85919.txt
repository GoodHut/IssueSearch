 URL : "https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/issues/7143" TITLE : g29 not leveling properly BODY : whenever my printer probes my bed the results are near useless. while the z-axis works to level the bed, it levels it completly wrong. i start with g28 followed by g29 with a grid of 7. i have a fairly large and most likely uneven bed. not really visible the eye hower when i lay a straight piece of wood or steel on it, i can see my torch undernearth from the other side. also confirmed this by uploading 3 different times on maui-3d.com. for example: http://www.maui-3d.com/cgi-bin/plotg29?plotg29id=12194 the other 2 i have plotted look nearly the same. to me it seems very likely to be a issue with the firmware. when i manually level the x-axis to the bed and manually move the axis left and right then it is mostly even. then i do g28 and g29 and doing the same move i did by hand via the interface of octoprint. looking at the distance between the nozzle and bed, it is clear that is correcting totally wrong. here is my configcuration.h: https://pastebin.com/bksdj2bh for the past several days i tried to figure out what the issue is. i am very sure this is an issue with the firmware or maybe my config. i am totally lost here.
