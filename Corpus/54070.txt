 URL : "https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/issues/899" TITLE : ffmpeg build is broken BODY : it appears that this bug is different from issue 865 https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/issues/865 that was causing the ffmpeg builds to fail. this is the relevant part of the build output step 1: step 15/21 : run svn co http://svn.xiph.org/trunk/ogg step 1: ---> running in 99a60560e88d step 1: redirecting to url 'https://svn.xiph.org/trunk/ogg': step 1:  91msvn: e170013: unable to connect to a repository at url 'https://svn.xiph.org/trunk/ogg' step 1: svn: e230001: server ssl certificate verification failed: issuer is not trusted step 1: the command '/bin/sh -c svn co http://svn.xiph.org/trunk/ogg' returned a non-zero code: 1 finished step 1 error error: build step gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker@sha256:df0cfe8c883cd7757b61cbc9f29a63b99d85ff640b656b1235547f8bcb353c60 failed: exit status 1 the certificate for svn.xiph.org is issued by startcom. locally when i try the command svn co http://svn.xiph.org/trunk/ogg i get this error message: error validating server certificate for 'https://svn.xiph.org:443': - the certificate is not issued by a trusted authority. use the fingerprint to validate the certificate manually! this seems related to chrome's recent removal of trust https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/ !topic/net-dev/fkxe-76go8y from startcom. the cert for https://xiph.org/ is issued by letsencrypt and appears trusted. maybe the xiph folks need to be bugged into changing the cert used on svn.xiph.org? i would check to see if there is a bug on the xiph.org bug tracker about this but i cannot reach https://trac.xiph.org/ because it also uses a startcom cert :-
