 URL : "https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js/issues/4206" TITLE : low fps on iphone 6 plus BODY : pixi.js is doing amazingly well for us on all our android and ios devices except iphone 6 plus. first discovered in our own game, later on we found that it can be successfully reproduced using http://www.goodboydigital.com/pixijs/bunnymark/. on most devices, it can keep 60 fps at even 50k bunnies, which is impressive. however, iphone 6 plus seems to be an exception. fps drops to around 30 with just 3k bunnies, and close to zero with 10k. anyone has any clue on what's special with iphone 6 plus?
