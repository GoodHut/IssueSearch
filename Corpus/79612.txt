 URL : "https://github.com/paternogbc/sensiPhy/issues/178" TITLE : some more changes sorry! BODY : while going over the package one last time, i am running into a few minor things and have made changes. i know this means we'll have to rerun the manuals etc., @paternogbc . sorry! just thought i'd maintain a list of changes i have made for our records. - clade_cont/clade_discrete had n.sim=1 for the first example for both. i think this is to limit the time for the cran checks. for the ones which are in the 'not-run' part which should not be tested anyway right , but are shown to the end-user, i have again increased this to n=20, because otherwise looks weird. - clade_cont/clade_discrete had an error in the output for full estimates the optpar was printed twice . - minor typos in clade_cont/clade_discrete
