 URL : "https://github.com/a-type/styled-library-themer/issues/2" TITLE : improve variant cascading BODY : currently, more complex usages with variants and nested components causes confusing behavior. for instance, if you have a component which utilizes a small version of another component inside it, and you apply a variant to the outer component, that internal component will not receive the variant. perhaps a new type of variant is needed which 'passes through' variants from the outer context in addition to the ones defined, while the default behavior is to override outer variants.
