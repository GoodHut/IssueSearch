 URL : "https://github.com/DallasMorningNews/django-chartwerk/issues/27" TITLE : drf auth vs. view auth BODY : we allow custom view decorators to be passed in to handle auth for the views that serve the chartwerk editor, but don't allow users to customize auth for django rest framework views it's set to isauthenticedorreadonly http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/permissions/ isauthenticatedorreadonly for now . ideas: - have users handle this using drf's existing settings this assumes that we won't end up with un-authed views out of the box - let them specify a class and decorate drf views with that, just like the other views - we use our own permissions class and allow all reads, but decorate writes with the same decorator passed in for the other views?? see http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/permissions/ custom-permissions
