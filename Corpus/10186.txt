 URL : "https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/224" TITLE : bfd support flag BODY : we've begun using bfd sessions with a number of our peers. the mice website's participants page has added a column with this, and that has encouraged a few networks to offer it. it could also be an option for ix route servers. imo it would be useful to have a bfd support flag in peeringdb for organizations using this, so consider it a feature request if y'all agree!
