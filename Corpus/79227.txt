 URL : "https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-unity-sdk/issues/329" TITLE : scaling - again. sdk 1.2 BODY : i recently upgraded the sdk from 1.1 to 1.2 in my project. previously i was inheriting from the abstractmap class and had a zoom of 14 and tile size of 100 and found that gave me 1 unity unit = 1m on imported sketchup models = 1m on map. after upgrading i switched to inherit from basicmap but i've found that i needed to change the zoom to 15 and the tile size to 550 in order to maintain the same scaling. i get that the sdk is under development and things will change, but is there some definitive explanation of the relationship between zoom, tile size and unity units? according to an answer in 50 setting worldscalefactor to 1 and later ensuring localscale of worldroot ? is 1 will give a 1:1 unity to real world scale and take tile size out of it, but that's clearly not the case, or at least that's not what i'm seeing. perhaps tÄ¥ere is some additional steps i need to take, but it's not obvious to me what those might be. a sample implementation of basicmap or abstractmap showing a couple scenarios e.g. 1:1 and a case where you want to scale down for gigantic worlds would probably clear up a lot of confusion.
