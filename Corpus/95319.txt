 URL : "https://github.com/alexcrichton/git2-rs/issues/238" TITLE : creating blobs from stream BODY : as i see the blobs can be created using files in filesystem and also binary data in memory. the libgit2 provides api to create blobs using streaming https://libgit2.github.com/libgit2/ head/group/blob/git_blob_create_fromstream . are bindings supports streaming feature? i would like to piping uploaded data directly to blobs without additional buffering and storing on filesystem.
