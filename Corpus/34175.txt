 URL : "https://github.com/ORelio/Minecraft-Console-Client/issues/233" TITLE : c script: of players BODY : i don't think there is a way to show how many players there is on the server. i'm aware there is /list but i need a automatically updating number for a c script. i'm making a script where when the server reaches 40 players, it activates an event, perhaps like hangman, or just announces there is 40 players.
