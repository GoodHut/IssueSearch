 URL : "https://github.com/jsimonetti/go-artnet/issues/1" TITLE : make logger configurable BODY : hi there, i'm using you library to control lights on stage with my band, so thanks a lot for building it! ❤️ as i'm running it as a subsystem of https://github.com/stageautocontrol/controller/ i'm experiencing some problems with debugging problems as i'm unfortunately unable to reduce the verbosity of go-artnet. i would like to suggest two changes: 1. change log entries to be debug entries, normally you won't need them i guess. 2 make the package logger either injectable or configurable, for example as a exported variable that is accessible. does this sound reasonable to ya? looking forward to your feedback! cheers, alex
