 URL : "https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/4261" TITLE : server code bundling BODY : webpack 2.2.1, node v7.5.0 i created very simple app to check how server code bundling works and webpack bundled only the entry point file and didn't transpile the code. i've asked on stack overflow and gitter already. do you want to request a feature or report a bug ? a bug, i suppose what is the current behavior? webpack doesn't bundling modules and the code is not transpiled. if the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce. javascript import path from 'path' const src = path.resolve __dirname, './server' const build = path.resolve __dirname, './build/' export default { target: 'node', context: src, entry: './', output: { path: build, filename: 'server.bundle.js', publicpath: '/assets/' }, module: { noparse: /node_modules/, // don't bundle modules from node_modules folder rules: { test: /\.js$/, use: { loader: 'babel-loader', options: { babelrc: false, presets: 'env', { modules: false, targets: { node: 'current', } } } } } }, node: { __dirname: false, __filename: false } } what is the expected behavior? webpack should bundle modules and transpile code using babel-loader
