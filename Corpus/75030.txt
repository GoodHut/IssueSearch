 URL : "https://github.com/bitwiseworks/mozilla-os2/issues/238" TITLE : frequent crashes on maps BODY : i'm seeing crashes in web pages which contain maps. google maps is the most frequent, but crashes have also occured for bing and mapquest. the map can be alone or embedded. no .trp is created and no entry in popuplog.os2, either. seamonkey crashes the same way. i'm using firefox 45 beta 8. i have tried a new profile, and for one or two times the problem did not occur. then is was back. if i can think of a way to give a test url, i will. for now, any url that crashes firefox disappears before i can copy to the clipboard. this bug report is accompanied by a discussion on os/2 world; http://www.os2world.com/forum/index.php?topic=1469.msg14191 msg14191
