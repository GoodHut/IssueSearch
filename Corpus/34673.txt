 URL : "https://github.com/docker/libcompose/issues/490" TITLE : compose version: 2.0 BODY : hey folks, noticed an issue https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-cli/issues/305 issuecomment-327244778 using a downstream project ecs-cli https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-cli where libcompose fails to parse the compose file when version is set to 2.0 instead of 2 . i have never been a gopher but if i had to take a stab at it it seems like the issue is a naive string comparison here https://github.com/docker/libcompose/blob/aadc1f7ce5d373af10e7f841eefea8ca94a0548b/config/merge.go l34 : if config.version != 2 { ... when really one would want to check for 2 or 2.0 ? a good test might be ./libcompose-cli config | ./libcompose-cli -f - config using any docker-compose.yml. this is essentially how i ran into the bug in the wild and is a convenient way to assert that libcompose-cli config only outputs valid compose files and can read all valid compose files. thanks in advance! sorry i can't be any more help :sad:
