 URL : "https://github.com/WoWManiaUK/Redemption/issues/1014" TITLE : crowleg dan BODY : this quest, http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/quest:%22crowleg%22_dan, is part of the howling fjord quest-chain to obtain the achievement i've toured the fjord , becomes available at nearly the end, and is very-well bugged. the quests asks you to talk to the npc and challenge him, once you talk to the npc, he does nothing, he simply moves for a tiny bit and then nothing. you can't talk to the npc again or attack him because he's friendly . after abandoning the quest countless times, relogging, leaving howling fjord in its entirety; the npc stayed bugged. please look into it, it's too easy of a quest to just be abandoned to be honest, very easy gold and experience. and as i said, it's required for loremaster of northrend. cheers.
