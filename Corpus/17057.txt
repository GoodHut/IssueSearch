 URL : "https://github.com/ktbyers/netmiko/issues/543" TITLE : need help netmiko BODY : hi all, i am new to netmiko. i have to develop the script to push config to the switch and router. the weird thing about my script is sometimes it works fine, sometimes it had errors and rerun exactly the same script and it works. i also add the 'global_delay_factor': 2 in the connecthandler. all devices are cisco routers/switches let's say my script named scriptx.py. i am using raw_input to input name of router i need to config. i am not using multi thread or multi process at all. just when i got a call do it for site a, i ran the script for site a: open cmd python scriptx.py input router: sitea_router_name then if site b, i do exactly same thing open another cmd... just input different router name. and the scriptx is running parallel. is that ok to do that or it will cause some issues? one more thing is sitea is totally independent of siteb. i know it is a general question but i would love to provide more information if you need to clarify. def connection_create_ssh current_ip_address, username, password : cisco = { 'device_type' : 'cisco_ios', 'ip' : current_ip_address, 'username': username, 'password': password, 'global_delay_factor': 2, } connect = connecthandler cisco return connect the method i used is send_config_set most likely i have some problem with login. there are more but i just remember some of those eg : no existing session unable to find prompt: error reading ssh protocol banner errno 10054 an existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host
