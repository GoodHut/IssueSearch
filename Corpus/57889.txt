 URL : "https://github.com/nikooo777/ckSurf/issues/73" TITLE : replay bot bugging out BODY : certain surf maps have the golden knife, aka a map trigger which sets player_speedmod to a value higher than 1. it appears this speed multiplier is not reflected in the speed cksurf displays, nor is it reflected in cl_showpos 1. i'm trying to actually figure out how exactly this even modifies the player within the game engine because as far as i can tell so far no cvars are edited, nothing to do with speed, velocity, etc.. all i can think is speedmod is a hardcoded multiplier that occurs after all the in game calculations and relevant data is pulled. not sure if anyone has decided to try to fix this, but the server i'd like to fix it on i noticed is still running 1.18 so not sure if this has ever been addressed by any of you? bout to start digging myself. thanks guys!
