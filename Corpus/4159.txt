 URL : "https://github.com/cozuya/secret-hitler/issues/173" TITLE : add voice chat BODY : it would be great if you could implement push to talk mic support into the game and have mic only lobbies. to me it is pointless to play a game about reading other people without voice chat. i know you can use discord but not many people do. i feel like many more people would use mics if it worked directly through the game.
