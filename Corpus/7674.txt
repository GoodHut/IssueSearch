 URL : "https://github.com/fnproject/fn/issues/531" TITLE : hybrid mode mvp BODY : there are 3 main parts that will work together to make hybrid work. 1 fn server api 2 fn lb 3 fn runners/workers at a high level, they interact like this: control plane | &nbsp; | work plane ------------ | ---- | ------------- fn server | &larr; | fn lb s &darr; | &uarr; | &darr; database | &larr; | fn runner s mq | &nbsp; | &darr; blob store | &nbsp; | ?blob store where everything in the work plane talks to the fn server to tell it what to do. as a bare minimum starting point, we should have 3 containers that we can run like this: start control plane: sh docker run ... fnproject/fnserver start work plane sh docker run ... fnproject/fnlb docker run .... fnproject/fnrunner fn server this probably doesn't really have to change much except: flag to disable async processing new api endpoints to support below fn lb allow runners to register themselves how to do this with multiple lbs running? ?? i know there's more to this runners when fnrunner starts, it will: register itself with the fnlb start asking the fnserver for async alls for each call it gets, it will: x execute call report status to fnserver send logs to fnserver this could store logs in local blob store, but for first attempt, let's assume this isn't the case
