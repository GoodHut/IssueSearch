 URL : "https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/issues/6437" TITLE : add tests for z-wave BODY : if we want to consider z-wave a serious member of the home assistant family, we will need to make sure there is proper test coverage of the component and platforms. @andrey-git made a very small start but we need more tests, a lot more. we should create a mock openzwave like we did for mqtt, so that it will be easy to do something like mock_zwave.trigger_value_changed â€¦ here is a quick roundup of things that will require tests: - config is passed to zwaveoption in setup - test for each service - auto heal is set up correctly and calls right commands - z-wave switch - z-wave sensor - z-wave light - z-wave climate - z-wave lock - z-wave binary_sensor - test workaround workaround_no_off_event - test workaround workaround_no_position - test workaround workaround_reverse_open_close - test workaround workaround_refresh_node_on_update - test workaround workaround_ignore to ensure we are not making it worse, all z-wave prs moving forward will require tests to be written.
