 URL : "https://github.com/raviqqe/tisp/issues/36" TITLE : kahn process networks BODY : the way the time is space principle is documented https://raviqqe.github.io/tisp/ programs as functions from a stream of inputs to a stream of outputs makes it spectacularly similar to the kahn process networks https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kahn_process_networks model of computation and programming. several programming languages for reactive programming has been inspired by kahn networks, in particular lustre https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lustre_ programming_language and lucid synchrone https://www.di.ens.fr/~pouzet/lucid-synchrone/ . there have also been work on efficient runtime for this form of parallelism, based on efficient implementations https://hal-ens.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00862450 of concurrent fifo queues. i think it would be interesting for the authors of tisp looking at these languages to see if there are ideas to take inspiration from.
