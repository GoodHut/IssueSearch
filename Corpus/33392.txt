 URL : "https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/1374" TITLE : add monitoring tool? BODY : currently, the only monitoring tool that is available almost out of the box is htop , which you need to install when ssh-ed in the vagrant. and htop is not that powerful. i don't know if it has any kind of logging available. i tried installing prometheus https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus , but i couldn't start node exporter on it. prometheus adds a nice dashboard, and is good for tracking metrics on the virtual server. installing prometheus on ubuntu 14.04 https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-prometheus-to-monitor-your-ubuntu-14-04-server . thoughts on adding it to the vvv by default?
