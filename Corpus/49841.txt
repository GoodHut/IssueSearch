 URL : "https://github.com/gmasterscm/ama/issues/23" TITLE : updater never updates BODY : i got an update there's a new version today, to 0.9.400. i told gmaster to restart and update and got a dialog saying gmaster is still running, confirming i want to close all processes and continue with the update, but nothing happens. loading gmaster again shows its still at the older version.
