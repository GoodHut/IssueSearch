 URL : "https://github.com/Team138Entropy/Entropy2017/issues/3" TITLE : post season goals BODY : i assume we'll want to enter the current competition robot in the river rampage event next fall. what sorts of improvements can we consider in the time between now and then? 1. change sprockets on drive chain to increase maximum speed. 2. autonomous improvements a improved motor control for autonomous ramps, empirical encoder calibration b distance sensors or bump detector to check whether gear spoke has bumped up against peg - what adjustment do we make in that case? c after the gear is pegged, move to best position for beginning of teleop phase. d add a fuel handling option - either a shooter or simple fuel dumper would be worth 3 extra points at a time when we can't otherwise earn points e could vision processing improve on driver performance for gear pickup or placement during teleop? 3 rope climber improvements a larger diameter spool? faster climbing speed? what did we learn from observing other teams' climbing mechanisms? b center-of-gravity dependence - could we add another pulley that would help center the rope? 4 fuel handling we had consigned fuel handling to a not-so-important status. if we revisit this decision, are there easy and cheap solutions that could be added to the robot?
