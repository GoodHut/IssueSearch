 URL : "https://github.com/culturekings/shopify-app-auth-laravel/issues/2" TITLE : clarity on package setup BODY : so far, it has been quite easy to set the package, but there are a few minor hiccups. i understand this package is quite new and will have more documentation in the future, could you please provide some clarity. 1. how to set the package to use for multiple apps within the same repository 2. there is a success page, which is kinda the default the page that it redirects to on successful installation of the app and also when the user opens an app that was already installed. is there a way to open a different page instead of opening the success page when the app is opened. 3. based on the usage section https://github.com/culturekings/shopify-app-auth-laravel usage , are these variables always accessible on the views?
