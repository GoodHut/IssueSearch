 URL : "https://github.com/radiasoft/devops/issues/86" TITLE : disk quotas in docker BODY : docker does not support disk quotas for mounted volumes, just the root partition. we should probably limit that at some point, but the issue on jupyterhub has been in the volumes. linux supports quotas per linux user. we could solve the juypterhub issue radiasoft/devops 85 by binding github users to linux users. this would create some issues within the container, which might be solvable through user mapping. there's a long discussion https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/disk-accounting.md in the kubernetes community, but i don't think they have a good solution. we might be able to allocate a partition per user, which would require work, but it would allow us to limit the total size per users by allowing the partitions to grow up to a maximum. i'm not sure how the disk fragmentation issue would work, but it could be resolved. this would require quite a bit of coordination, but it is probably doable. zfs does support per directory quotas, but there have been too many issues with zfs.
