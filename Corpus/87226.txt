 URL : "https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/15804" TITLE : i’m your secret admirer BODY : hey ember community over the past year i’ve been working with react applications. i followed the hype and i build with react, yes react itself is great but everything else around it is complicated, fragmented, and inconsistent. needless to say looking back, i have to say i wish that i had started here at ember. the amount of hours i’ve wasted setting up react, webpack, react router this is most infuriating because by the time i understood the router they released a new version which was totally different and imo didn’t make things better i’m just here to let you guys know if i start a new project today it would be in ember. keep doing what you guys are doing, you guys are on the right path. you provide a cohesive experience for building ambitious front end application just as advertised. ember is by far the right choice, coming from a guy who now has to maintain react apps.
