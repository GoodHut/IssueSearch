 URL : "https://github.com/circe/circe-yaml/issues/31" TITLE : support merge keys BODY : snakeyaml supports yaml's merge key extension http://yaml.org/type/merge.html , which makes the last four elements in this sequence resolve to the same thing: scala scala> val doc = | --- | - &center { x: 1, y: 2 } | - &left { x: 0, y: 2 } | - &big { r: 10 } | - &small { r: 1 } | | all the following maps are equal: | | - explicit keys | x: 1 | y: 2 | r: 10 | label: center/big | | - merge one map | << : center | r: 10 | label: center/big | | - merge multiple maps | << : center, big | label: center/big | | - override | << : big, left, small | x: 1 | label: center/big | this functionality isn't currently available in circe-yaml, which does resolve the references but returns json objects with << keys in them. i need this functionality, and while i could hack it with cursors or something i'd rather take advantage of the fact that snakeyaml can do it for me. this seems pretty easyâ€”you can just subclass org.yaml.snakeyaml.constructor.safeconstructor and call its protected flattenmapping on your mapping nodes. i'm assuming we don't want this to be the default behavior, so i think we'll want some way to set options either in the parser itself or in the yamltojson method. i'm happy to take a stab at this as soon as possible but if anyone has ideas about how it should look, please let me know. /cc @jeremyrsmith @jeffmay @jonas @denisrosset
