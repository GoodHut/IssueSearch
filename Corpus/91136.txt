 URL : "https://github.com/larray-project/larray-editor/issues/49" TITLE : sync version with larray? BODY : shouldn't we synchronize the version number with larray? this would simplify handling milestones. here, it is not obvious that 0.1.1 issues would go with the 0.25.1 larray release. the only downside i see to do this is if we ever want to release a new version which has changes only in the editor, which will make two core larray packages with the same code except for the version number. that seems odd but i can live with that for ease of maintenance.
