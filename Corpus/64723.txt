 URL : "https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/issues/1629" TITLE : high download number... BODY : so about two days ago saturyay i uploaded a gem to rubygems.org and wasn't really expecting anyone to download it. however, now the download counter says, that my gem has been downloaded 500+ times and i'm kind of wondering if this means that i am gaining a big usership or if that number is in any way fake or distorted! i am not complaining, i am merely quite puzzled.
