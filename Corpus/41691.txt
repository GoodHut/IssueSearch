 URL : "https://github.com/jwir3/minuteman/issues/8" TITLE : add command line tool BODY : we should add a command line tool to the npm package that allows us to parse a minutes json file and then output an html file with the minutes put into the form required. ideally, the command line would work something like this: $ minuteman-bin -f <input-file> -o <output-file> -c <config-file> if <input-file> is not specified, it will read from stdin if <output-file> is not specified, it will output to stdout if <config-file> is not specified, it will read from the .minuteman/config.json in the user's home directory.
