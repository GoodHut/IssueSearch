 URL : "https://github.com/weaveworks/scope/issues/2321" TITLE : zoom control not obvious BODY : luke watched a user struggling to work out how to zoom in scope. they used the browser zoom, which only zooms everything except the graph. and they didn't realise that mousewheel zoomed at all. i wonder whether a browser zoom should zoom everything, and we should add some google maps style zoom control in the bottom right corner.
