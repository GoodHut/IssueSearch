 URL : "https://github.com/valit-stack/Valit/issues/135" TITLE : asserts in tests BODY : i was dabbling around and noticed the assert.equal methods in the tests are having the wrong signature. for example: assert.equal result.succeeded, expected ; should be: assert.equal expected, result.succeeded ; is it ok to change this assert.true and assert.false by using shouldly ? this way all our tests are written with shouldly .
