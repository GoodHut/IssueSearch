 URL : "https://github.com/newsboat/newsboat/issues/85" TITLE : ftbfs on gnu/hurd BODY : copy of akrennmair/newsbeuter 413 adding it here since it was re-submitted to the debian bug tracker https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=884894 --- newsbeuter fails to build with the hurd kernel on the debian package builder https://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p=newsboat full build log https://buildd.debian.org/status/fetch.php?pkg=newsboat&arch=hurd-i386&ver=2.10.1-1&stamp=1513625723&raw=0 the reason appears to be that hurd does not have the maxpathlen macro defined, wiki confirms it and provides some example patches https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/porting/guidelines.html path_max_tt_max_path_tt_maxpathl while i am not sure how well newsboat would work on hurd i do not use the system myself so i am unable to test it it's probably worth looking into.
