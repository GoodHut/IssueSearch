 URL : "https://github.com/cutechess/cutechess/issues/293" TITLE : can't quit from cutechess BODY : cutechess enables to add xboard protocol engine without changing the protocol from uci to xboard. the new engine can't be selected when starting a new game. it's not in the list at all. but. if i quit from cutechess and start it again, it enables to select such engines. if i start a new engine-engine game for example crafty vs. fairymax, both left on uci cutechess doesn't start it and send no message about what was the problem. after this affair it disables to quit from cutechess! btw. there is a thread about auto detecting engine protocols starting here http://talkchess.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=65485&postdays=0&postorder=asc&topic_view=&start=80
