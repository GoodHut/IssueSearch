 URL : "https://github.com/glimmerjs/glimmer.js/issues/56" TITLE : turn on noimplicitany BODY : if an application chooses to use the noimplicitany they will have a really bad time with packages coming from this mono repo. while we have done a decent job at typing, we should turn on noimplicitany in the monorepo and fix forward. the largest offender are the test. this issue can be addressed file by file. how to help 1. locally change noimplicitany in tsconfig.json to true . 2. run yarn run problems 3. see failures 4. pick a file to fix the type errors 5. turn noimplicitany back to false 6. create pr we will turn on noimplicitany once we have resolved the issue
