 URL : "https://github.com/EmberSherpa/ember-cli-app-version/issues/46" TITLE : needs release of 3.1.0 BODY : the recent blueprint updates and version bumps that are on master need to be released to go along with ember-cli@2.16.0-beta.1 . can we get a 3.1.0 released? since this is included in ember-cli by default i wonder if you would mind allowing @stefanpenner or myself to publish/release also i believe we have merge access but not npm publish access ? /cc @taras @alexlafroscia
