 URL : "https://github.com/conveyal/r5/issues/209" TITLE : serialized linkages lost BODY : we now pre-build a grid pointset and link it to the street network before serializing the graph to save time on re-load. however, the cache of linkages within the pointset is keyed on the streetnetwork object itself, which has identity equality. the identity of the object after a round trip through serialization. a scenario belongs to a single transportnetwork, so couldn't we just key the linkage cache on the scenario id?
