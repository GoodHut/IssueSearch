 URL : "https://github.com/mantidproject/mslice/issues/122" TITLE : plot window focus BODY : after clicking plot in the cut tab, the focus should change to the plot window. presently, if a new plot window is create it inherits focus, but if the window already exists and the data is overplotted or replotted, then it does not get focus. ideally, this behaviour should be modifiable by an option somewhere.
