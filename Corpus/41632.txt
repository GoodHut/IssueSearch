 URL : "https://github.com/quaap/LaunchTime/issues/5" TITLE : add an 'all' category BODY : i think it would make sense to have a category listing for all applications, so one can use it in a more traditional way if they want to check for all the applications they have installed. ot: i just installed launchtime from f-droid and love what you are doing with this launcher implementation! it feels very practical and responsive so far.
