 URL : "https://github.com/easydigitaldownloads/themedd/issues/29" TITLE : theme defined image sizes BODY : while staying strict to edd the download featured images are set based on the wordpress media/thumbnail sizes, which isn't ideal within a theme like this that uses larger images on the product grid, etc. ideally theme specific image sizes would be set up in the functions.php file that could be overridden by child themes for the various parts of edd.
