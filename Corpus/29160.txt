 URL : "https://github.com/pwoolcoc/dhcp_parser/issues/2" TITLE : issues with package BODY : hey : it appears the version published to crates.io isn't compatible with rust stable: error e0554 : feature may not be used on the stable release channel --> /some/path/.cargo/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/dhcp_parser-0.1.0/src/lib.rs:1:1 | 1 | ! feature ip_addr | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ i think the correct way to check for features would be: cfg feature = ip_addr i also looked into the cargo.toml, and found some more issues: dependencies nom = enum_primitive = dependencies.num version = default-features = false these should point to specific versions that dhcp_parser is compatible with. also, the last dependency is pointing to a local path that doesn't exist on my system: dependencies.rest_easy path = ../rest_easy i'd really like to use your package, i'd greatly appreciate if you could look into this. thanks! :
