 URL : "https://github.com/realestate-com-au/stackup/issues/38" TITLE : multi-os docker image BODY : g'day @mdub, i've found myself in the unfortunate position where i occasionally have to run stackup from a _windows_ host. ruby is quite the pain on windows and i've got an uphill fight if i want to convince coworkers to go through that pain to enjoy the bliss that is stackup . how amenable would you be to a pr that adds multi-os support to the docker images for stackup ? now with docker supporting both linux and windows containers but not both at the same time without massive pain , it would be nice if users could just docker run -it stackup regardless of which mode is currently active. i'd be happy to do the work, just want to know if you'd accept something like that spoiling this otherwise wonderful repo.
