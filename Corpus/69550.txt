 URL : "https://github.com/mb243/THBL/issues/77" TITLE : the confiscating plugin BODY : this one is too much in my opinion. we are a small server and this plugin is causing only trouble to the few devoted players here. i could see this plugin being very useful if we had a larger player base. while i can agree that knockback on an axe may be op . but, in no way will it ever out dps the similarly enchanted sword equivalent. therefore, i dont believe it to be a game changing exploit and worth all this headache. on behalf of zad, he has lost multiple tools that he claims legit. same for me, i have lost several tools and i think it took my shovel again, can not verify , and now, it has taken iron blocks from my chest i store the precious items in, the items i collected over the twenty days of play time here. please disable this plugin. i could see a more viable reason to install it if we had more players, but its only hurting the few players that want to be here longer and invest their time into creating on this server. this plugin is creating a nanny-state of the server and ruining the experience.
