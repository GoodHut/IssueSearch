 URL : "https://github.com/yuqikang/yuqikang/issues/3" TITLE : dfd comments feb 1 BODY : here are a few comments: 1 software and mainframe as you have on the dfd can be removed 2 accept packages should be named something like scan for oss components 3 confirm data should be named something like oss package results. the oss package results would then be sent to the db as you have and back to the developer. 4 you can likely remove the process/analyze package process and all the associated dataflows. i hope this helps. mg
