 URL : "https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack/issues/256" TITLE : trying to compile BODY : os-x 10.9.5 rack version 0.40 i'm trying to compile some plugins but also rack itself. after 'make dep' and waiting a while i got: built all dependencies successfully that felt nice, i messed up with cmake earlier. so i do 'make' - to compile rack - and this is where it fails. i got: include/widgets.hpp:5:10: fatal error: '../ext/nanovg/src/nanovg.h' file not found all four folders inside ext are empty. the folders 'nanovg' for instance are there but empty. while trying to compile any plugin i get the same error. any clues as where to start digging?
