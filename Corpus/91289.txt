 URL : "https://github.com/whatyouhide/stream_data/issues/19" TITLE : testing specific examples BODY : sometimes streamdata might find some interesting examples, which might be hard to find and which we want to test everytime. hypothesis https://github.com/hypothesisworks/hypothesis-python deals with that by using the @example decorator: python ensure this string is tested @example s= $%6!>z given any string, test the invariants in the function below @given s=text def test_something s : ... there should be a way to make sure specific examples are tested. i suggest something like this: elixir check all int1 <- int , int2 <- int , int1 > 0 and int2 > 0, sum = int1 + int2, with_examples: before/after trying the generators, try these: {int1: 1, int2: 2}, {int1: 3, int2: 7} do assert sum > int1 assert sum > int2 end
