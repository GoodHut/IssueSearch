 URL : "https://github.com/ehmatthes/intro_programming/issues/137" TITLE : update the entire project BODY : i have been meaning to come back to this project for a long time. i went to pycon this week, and was completely inspired to revive this project. jupyter notebooks have evolved since i last worked on this, and the time seems ripe to bring this project to maturity. this project will be mature when: - contributors can simply develop a jupyter notebook about a project, submit a pr, and have their project included in the overall project. - people can have a local version of the website running on their own computer after running a single python script. the script should call nbconvert, and then do any post-processing that's needed. as much as possible of the html rendering should be done through nbconvert, and there should be no shell scripts involved. - it should be really easy to use the project to start a similar website for a different language. fork the repository, strip out the existing notebooks, write your own notebooks, run the conversion script, and you should have a static site ready to deploy. this will become a meta-issue, and the work to do this will be broken into a series of more specific issues.
