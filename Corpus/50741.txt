 URL : "https://github.com/amdelamar/pm-theme/issues/10" TITLE : active color of labels BODY : the color of the currently selected label in the menu bar is white for the flat theme. makes it hard to read in front of the light background. i think the font-style should be consistent with the other menu items.
