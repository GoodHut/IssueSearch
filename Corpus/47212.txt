 URL : "https://github.com/capnkirok/animania/issues/60" TITLE : odd issue with server BODY : i am having a very strange issue.. i want to try this mod but it was spawning too many mobs and causing lag.. that's not the strange issue though. so i removed animania from my server in an attempt to fix the lag but was confused when i logged back in and still saw animania mobs on my screen. they were not moving and massive amounts pilled onto each other. my f3 entity count was skyrocketing from 30 to over 3000. the server wasn't lagging, it was just my client. current mod list https://paste.ee/r/m7lkq/0 _recap_ client with animania installed logged into server without animania and animania mobs still appeared on client's screen causing entity count to skyrocket.
