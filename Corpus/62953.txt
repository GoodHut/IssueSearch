 URL : "https://github.com/airbnb/react-native-maps/issues/1396" TITLE : custom double tap event BODY : hello everyone, i m currently working with a app that requires as a main component the react-native-maps. with that in mind, there were an unusual request to customize the double tap function on the map. basically we need to set the double tap event to do function a zoom and the next double tap event to do function b show all the currently markers on the map . the function is the easy part but i m not seeing any solution for this and even can t see the double tap event on the onpress={} props of the mapview. does anyone have any tip on this matter ?
