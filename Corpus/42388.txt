 URL : "https://github.com/cgonser/swiftmailer-database-s3-spool-bundle/issues/3" TITLE : aws credentials issue BODY : hi i've just noticed that this bundle cannot connect to newest aws sdk. when i try to upload message to s3, i receive an error: aws\exception\credentialsexception error retrieving credentials from the instance profile metadata server. curl error 28: connection timed out after 1001 milliseconds see http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/libcurl-errors.html which is related to new aws configuration, now credentials needs to be in an array such as: credentials: key: %aws-key% secret: %aws-secret% thus if you add this array while debugging to $s3config in databases3spool constructor then it will save message to s3. otherwise it fails with error described above. is there any way to fix this, or should i fork this repo or anything and do it by myself? btw i'm using: aws/aws-sdk-php-symfony : ^1.2 , cgonser/swiftmailer-database-s3-spool-bundle : dev-master
