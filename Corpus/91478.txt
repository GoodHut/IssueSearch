 URL : "https://github.com/thomashenauer/chargemaster-protocol/issues/1" TITLE : transaction type decoding BODY : hey thomas, great work so far! also having a skyrc charger i too thought about decoding that protocol. well, i think i've got news for you: the byte before the end sequence is the modulo 0x100 checksum of the data block, beginning at type, ending at length-1: example: 05-transaction: 0000 0f 16 05 00 00 02 01 08 98 07 d0 0c 76 10 5e 00 0010 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 6f ff ff 00 00 00 00 00 00 5 + 2 + 1 + 8 + 98 + 7 + d0 + c + 76 + 10 + 5e mod 100 = 26f mod 100 = 6f tadaaa! i checked that for every transaction you documented, so i think that's it. hope that helped!
