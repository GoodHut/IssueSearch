 URL : "https://github.com/OrchardCMS/Orchard/issues/7910" TITLE : createtable bad handling? BODY : can someone confirm an issue i am seeing related to migrations? context: https://github.com/bleroy/nwazet.commerce/issues/141 code: https://gist.github.com/matteopiovanelli-laser/2bf66dcf313a8b912492e63956dfb1d2 basically, i am trying to do schemabuilder.createtable for an existing table, and eventually handling the exception. the reason is an attempt to make things retrocompatible. a workaround proposed by @hazzamanic is to do try { schemabuilder.executesql select from nwazet_commerce_stateorcountrytaxpartrecord ; } catch exception { // table does not exist schemabuilder.createtable stateorcountrytaxpartrecord , table => table .contentpartrecord .column<string> state .column<string> country .column<decimal> rate .column<int> priority ; } that works. but it has another issue: 7909
