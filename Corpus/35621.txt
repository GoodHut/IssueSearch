 URL : "https://github.com/kitling/ntrboot_flasher/issues/61" TITLE : error with dstt 9089 BODY : just like happen to the user on issue 58 https://github.com/kitling/ntrboot_flasher/issues/58 , my dstt stops at 99% reading. i see it is on the flashcarts that should probably work, but you have no specific datasheet for it. i make a dump of my card's firmware: http://www98.zippyshare.com/v/cxabq8oj/file.html i hope it helps you to give full compatibility with this card. as i said, it is a dstt - 9089 - intel 28f160b3t
