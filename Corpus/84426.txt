 URL : "https://github.com/openfin/fin-hypergrid/issues/537" TITLE : custom graphics functions BODY : i'd like to do: grid.canvas.gc.simpletext = grid.canvas.bc.simpletext = rendertext; with: function rendertext config, str, x, y { var gc = this; if config.somecondition { some_complex_function config, str, x, y ; } else { gc.filltext str, x, y ; } } the problem is that the filltext function has disappeared when i inspect the gc object in my browser so i can't render anything. in addition, i only want to render text using this method for a subset of columns because i don't want to incur any unecessary performance costs for the columns that should not be affected by this special rendering. how should i approach? at the moment, i have created a new renderer and i have copied the whole code of simplecell to only replace the calls to gc.simpletext with my function and i assign that new renderer only for the columns that should be affected. bonus neophyte question, what's the difference between grid.canvas.gc and grid.canvas.bc?
