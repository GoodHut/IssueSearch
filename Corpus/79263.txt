 URL : "https://github.com/Teradata/covalent/issues/796" TITLE : search - blur and onblur BODY : feature request what is the expected behavior? i should be able to call blur on the search input. i should be able to subscribe to the search input's onblur event. what is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior? i would like to hide and unfocus the search box and hide the keyboard on mobile after searching. i would like to hide the search box when the user clicks elsewhere. other information shouldn't be too hard to pipe the <input> events through. if you approve of the change, i can create a pr for it.
