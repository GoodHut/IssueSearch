 URL : "https://github.com/laravel/docs/issues/3197" TITLE : log::getmonolog in 5.4 BODY : as of laravel 5.4, it seems like getmonolog is not available by the log:: facade anymore - yet it's still documented at the very bottom of https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/errors. for me, i've resolved the issue by using the log::pushhandler $handler function directly, without requesting its underlying monolog instance first. as i don't know if there's a better way to do it, i'd rather not provide a bad pr ðŸ˜¨
