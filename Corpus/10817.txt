 URL : "https://github.com/wireservice/agate/issues/707" TITLE : division by zero BODY : when calculating the mean of a column i came across a situation where it would generate an error of divide by zero. i could see anything in the documentation about this so have created a small pull request which addresses this. the solution i've implemented is to return none from the mean operation if there are no valid values. otherwise, the calculation proceeds as normal https://github.com/wireservice/agate/pull/706 happy to discuss and amend if you feel that a different solution would be better. but thought it better to provide a solution rather than simply keep raising issues.
