 URL : "https://github.com/CKIXD/Doomed-Atlantis/issues/24" TITLE : small one-way connections BODY : if you pass through a medium or large opening, then place your new area tile so there's a small opening leading back to the area you left, is the connection small? but if the connection is small, do you need to immediately spend another action counter? certainly the connection is small if you want to go back the way you came, right?
