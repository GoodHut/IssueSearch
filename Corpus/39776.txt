BODY : hi, is there a way to stop the audio playback? i found a stopaudio method on cameramic.java https://github.com/josuigoa/cameramic/blob/master/dependencies/android/src/org/haxe/extension/cameramic/cameramic.java l207 but it doesn't seem to be defined on the c++ interface https://github.com/josuigoa/cameramic/blob/master/project/common/externalinterface.cpp . this is a big problem for my app: i need to terminate long recordings gracefully when users navigate away from the recording area. is there any chance you could add a stop-playback method?
