 URL : "https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/issues/555" TITLE : prettify remove comments BODY : hi, i think it could be valuable if the prettify function would not remove comments. currently all lines starting by are removed. i actually am working on migrating queries because for an mvp we are migrating from graphcool backend to custom graphql server and being able to annotate my queries and prettify them without loosing my comments would be very helpful. currently i have to do all the formatting manually otherwise all comments are gone.
