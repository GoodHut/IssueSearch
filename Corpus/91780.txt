 URL : "https://github.com/openvenues/jpostal/issues/19" TITLE : update for libpostal 1.0? BODY : i'm in the process of updating to 1.0 and it appears that the c api is slightly different. it's been a while since i did any c stuff so i might be wrong in my assessment. i'm going to take a crack at updating the code in jpostal and that will eventually tell me the answer one way or another. if i'm right, this issue gives me something to track against
