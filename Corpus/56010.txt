 URL : "https://github.com/rallured/PyXFocus/issues/4" TITLE : makeshift pull request BODY : @ctderoo @bddonovan you guys should pull the recent update to pyxfocus. i had created a wavefrontupdate branch on my local machine. i then merged it with my master and pushed both to github. i think what i should have done was pushed the wavefrontupdate to github, then submit a pull request to merge that with the master branch, and then pull to my local master. that pull request should have triggered you guys to pull, as well...i think. i'll try another update later on to see if that is how it's supposed to work.
