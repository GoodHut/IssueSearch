 URL : "https://github.com/louipc/tremc/issues/15" TITLE : cant execute tremc BODY : i recently had to reinstall my root partition because btrfs file corruption. prior to that i had no issues running tremc. when i try to run it now i get the error s raceback most recent call last : file /usr/bin/tremc , line 3702, in <module> interface file /usr/bin/tremc , line 985, in __init__ self.run file /usr/bin/tremc , line 1079, in run self.draw_stats file /usr/bin/tremc , line 2615, in draw_stats self.draw_global_rates file /usr/bin/tremc , line 2694, in draw_global_rates self.screen.addch curses.acs_uarrow, curses.a_reverse _curses.error: addch returned err i am no python wiz, and so this could be a configuration issue with my environment, but i can execute other python3 scripts no issue. i also have no trouble running transmission-remote-cli. so i think that rules out permission issues. any pointers would be greatly appreciated.
