 URL : "https://github.com/RakanNimer/react-google-charts/issues/113" TITLE : timeline tooltips leaking BODY : react-google-charts 1.4.2 react v15.4.2 expected behaviour if i hover over a bar in a timeline chart, a tooltip appears. if something now causes my chart to re-render, i expect the tooltip to either immediately on re-render, or better on timeout/mouse-out to disappear actual behaviour any tooltips that are visible when the component re-renders are never unloaded, and clutter up the screen steps to reproduce have a timeline chart that re-renders on a timer.
