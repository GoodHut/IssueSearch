 URL : "https://github.com/carlos8f/zenbot/issues/640" TITLE : creating a strategy BODY : hello, when it comes to strategies, i'm having a hard time determining what the difference should be when it comes to the significance of the calculate and onperiod method within the strategy. it appears that calculate is done on a timeframe that is not in agreement with the onperiod where the onperiod seems to align with the candlestick period that is defined. this leads me to three questions. 1. should the calcluate method actually be firing buy/sell signals when the onperiod is not soon enough? 2. if a new object is added to the s object in the calcluate , will it maintain the state of these additional objects for the lifetime of the zenbot session? 3. is there anywhere that i can see a breakdown of the core objects/properties and their explanations that reside in the s object that is passed between the calculate and onperiod methods? primarily, what is the significance of s.trend and s.signal and how they communicate to the bot what needs to happen in the market. if anyone could shed light on these three questions, it would greatly help. thanks!
