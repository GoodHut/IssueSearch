 URL : "https://github.com/njleonzhang/vue-data-tables/issues/96" TITLE : render html in cells BODY : hi there, this is not really an issue is more like a feature request. is it possible to render html in data table cell? it would be really handy if could be able to have html syntax in cells. we could style the elements or even have hyperlinks. e.g: data: { 'filename': '<span class= glyphicon glyphicon-text ></span> <a href= /download/file.txt>file</a>', 'size': '100 kb' }
