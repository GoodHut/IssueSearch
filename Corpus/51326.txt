 URL : "https://github.com/torfsen/service/issues/4" TITLE : advance status support BODY : currently it's very hard to get visibility into what the forked process is doing. the only status available is from the service looking at the pid file via the is_running function. imagine you need a service that has multiple threads, i want to expose how many threads are running by issuing the status call to main service status. or that i want to expose 1min, 5min, 60min counter values for the service itself. is there currently a way to do this? am i missing something? if not, is there a way to make the service listen on a socket for status reporting purposes. something like this: https://searchcode.com/codesearch/view/574564/
