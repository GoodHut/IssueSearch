BODY : the slider's slide event is fine and all, but i think it should emit the action we are sliding, next , prev or left , right . currently i was trying to compare indexes but that didn't help much when dynamically adding items to the slider. this would be a breaking change if we do it in the slide event because currently it only emits the new current index, and if we emit an object we could break someone's code. another way is to emit a whole new event, which is kind of redundant as it will emit on the same time. also i don't know if it should emit a slide event even if we try to go next but there are no other slides so the slider stays where it is, meaning it doesn't change its currentslide position. are some of these things in consideration or should i hop into it and try to do a pr? i ended up to these walls so to say when trying to do a dynamic infinite slider with preloading the prev and next slides.
