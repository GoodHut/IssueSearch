 URL : "https://github.com/petrslavotinek/grafana-carpetplot/issues/12" TITLE : y axis labels not showing BODY : labels for the y axis don't seem to be showing properly. y axis hide labels is disabled, but the labels still don't show. turning it on and off shifts the chart to the left a little bit, trying to make room for the labels, but it doesn't add enough room. i checked in the document source, and the labels are there, but not being shown. using grafana v4.6.2, and tested in latest chrome and firefox with the same results. ! texthidden2 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/669579/33450851-23929808-d5db-11e7-971d-6ad26461f789.png ! texthidden1 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/669579/33450852-239da1bc-d5db-11e7-91e7-bf3042f268e8.png
