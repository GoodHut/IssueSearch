 URL : "https://github.com/tomighty/tomighty-osx/issues/42" TITLE : tomighty for linux BODY : i guess this would fall into an enhancement of sorts, but is there a way to get a version that runs on linux. if so, how would one go about it? i'm happy to compile ad-infinitum or basically do whatever it takes to get one. thanks.
