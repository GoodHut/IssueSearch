 URL : "https://github.com/ViennaRSS/vienna-rss/issues/846" TITLE : status bar text behaviour BODY : from cocoaforge forums https://forums.cocoaforge.com/posting.php?mode=reply&f=18&t=26946 pr139859 : often i hover over a link in an article to see where it goes, only to have the status bar overwritten with the string, article load completed. it would be nice if this advisory were to be suppressed if the status bar is in actual use at the time. thanks.
