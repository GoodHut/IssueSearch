 URL : "https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db-docstore/issues/6" TITLE : docstore sync rate BODY : hello, i am creating an application with a distributed database using this docstore. however, i have noticed that when a new instance is booted up, it seems to either take forever to, or never, sync with already-running instances until someone does a put . is there supposed to be a timed sync event where instances of the docstore attempt to get the newest database among currently-running peers and what is the time period on that if it exists? , or is it intended that new peers don't get the store until it is modified? thanks
