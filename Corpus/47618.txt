 URL : "https://github.com/plone/plone.restapi/issues/272" TITLE : postman / newman spec BODY : postman allows creating collections which is basically a group of individual http calls. newman allows executing a postman collection via command line. we could investigate if this would allow us to create a plone.restapi spec that we could use as an acceptance test for plone.restapi. this could also help us to keep plone.restapi and guiolltina api in sync. @prakharjoshi you offered to look into this some time ago. are you still interested in working on that? cc @bloodbare @vangheem @sneridagh
