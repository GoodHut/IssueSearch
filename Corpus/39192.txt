 URL : "https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts/issues/143" TITLE : rfc improved imports BODY : rfc 1. export defaults what do you think about exporting the content of the modules as the default? for now, we should write imports like this: ts import { option, some, none } from 'fp-ts/lib/option' import as option from 'fp-ts/lib/option' and with this changes, we can write it like this: ts import option, { option, some, none } from 'fp-ts/lib/option' rfc 2. module names what's the need of the lib part in the module name? isn't it better to have it like this: ts import option, { option, some, none } from 'fp-ts/option'
