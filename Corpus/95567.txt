 URL : "https://github.com/snac-cooperative/snac/issues/54" TITLE : deferred load with preview BODY : in gitlab by @deternitydx on sep 11, 2017, 15:10 the deferred load of relations in the hrt and detailed view pages broke the preview functionality. if a user wants to preview, the webui must use the full version of those templates rather than the deferred load. note: need to grab the old detailed view page template and move it into the current version.
