 URL : "https://github.com/unpkg/unpkg-website/issues/66" TITLE : add support for cdn field BODY : now that the browser field will most likely be deprecated i think adding support for cdn if unpkg is not present would be the right thing to do. having to ask package maintainers to add multiple fields seems very unnecessary if cdn can cover 99% of the cases. maybe i'm missing something, but what are the cons of adding support for cdn ?
