 URL : "https://github.com/LeadPages/wdio-webpack-service/issues/2" TITLE : promise reject error BODY : in a case of webpack error, promise will still resolve since we don't have return here https://github.com/leadpages/wdio-webpack-service/blob/master/src/launcher.js l42 which will generate another failure here https://github.com/leadpages/wdio-webpack-service/blob/master/src/launcher.js l45 because stats will be undefined.
