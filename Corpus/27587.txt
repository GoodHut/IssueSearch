 URL : "https://github.com/viewflow/django-material/issues/387" TITLE : django 2.0 support? BODY : admin material is not working. i don't seem to have any issues, it just does not work. i see django 2.0 support released 10 days ago. are we still following the same install and setup instructions as mentioned here http://forms.viewflow.io/ ?? i'm using pipenv, i get no dependency conflicts. here is my pipfile. note: i've tried the same install setup using django 1.11 and django-material 1.1.0 and it worked, as long as you don't install graphene-django, but this led me to believe the issue is with django-material / django versions and not other features of my setup. djzen = dj-database-url = psycopg2 = graphene-django = djangorestframework = django-filter = markdown = django-cors-headers = graphene = django-uwsgi = ==0.2.1 django = ==2.0 django-material = ==1.2.0 names = requests = git clone https://github.com/kevinmind/django-crm.git to see issue. i get no errors... just no beautiful material.. :
