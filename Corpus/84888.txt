 URL : "https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/DOPP/issues/1" TITLE : dopp on consumer hardware BODY : is there a means to use consumer cards/drivers to do what dopp does? i'm looking to create a vdi application for the purposes of gaming and entertainment. as such i'd rather use consumer hardware for my passthrough devices but i'd really love to see some kind of dopp functionality in the consumer cards first. i saw on another issue someone had mentioned microsoft's desktop duplication api. i am considering this but was wondering if there are better options.
