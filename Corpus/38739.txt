 URL : "https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond/issues/105" TITLE : query coverage error BODY : i'm trying to run diamond from a website where you can give parameters such as output and query coverage. while the parameter '-o' is working, '--query-cover' gives an error: error: invalid parameter count for option '--query-cover' my question is what kind of input does it need, it suggests in the manual you need just a simple number but the input i give is a number. perhaps it needs a '%' symbol? when i delete the query coverage as a parameter it will run fine. greetings, patrick
