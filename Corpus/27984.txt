 URL : "https://github.com/KirkMcDonald/kirkmcdonald.github.io/issues/35" TITLE : evaluate bob's mods BODY : bob's plus angel's ores, and maybe some other mods significantly expands the recipe graph, and poses a significantly greater challenge for modeling than the vanilla game does. investigate how far this calculator can get when the bob's data is thrown at it, and how much work it would take to make it a practical tool.
