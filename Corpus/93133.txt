 URL : "https://github.com/WordPress/press-this/issues/7" TITLE : add featured image support BODY : originally https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39956 > featured image is a nicer datapoint than inserting the image html into a post's content. > > the media workflow for featured image doesn't actually save anything via ajax, it just returns html that gets blobbed into that page, and is then coincidentally associated on save. this works on the post edit screen because there is a meta box for the ajax to interact with. in press this, there is no target for the html, rendering the featured image workflow moot.
