 URL : "https://github.com/agentjesse/prj-rev-bwfs-dasmoto/issues/3" TITLE : wrap long lines in html BODY : just a minor code styling suggestion. it's good practice to wrap long lines of code to ~80 characters so that we can see all the code in the window without scrolling. something to keep in mind! to wrap, just have a newline in the code itself. it won't wrap like that in the actual page since newlines in html are only possible through <br /> so for most html you can comfortably add newlines and wrap text without changing the page look. https://github.com/agentjesse/prj-rev-bwfs-dasmoto/blob/master/dasmoto/index.html l18 https://github.com/agentjesse/prj-rev-bwfs-dasmoto/blob/master/dasmoto/index.html l27 https://github.com/agentjesse/prj-rev-bwfs-dasmoto/blob/master/dasmoto/index.html l36
