 URL : "https://github.com/vibornoff/webcrypto-shim/issues/19" TITLE : interop with indexeddb BODY : hi there, firstly, thank you for taking the time to creating this library! it really does make a lot of headaches go away : i have a question about using it in conjunction with indexeddb testing done in ie11 , which seems not to be able to store the underlying key instances the _key field in the custom cryptokey definition . that makes for a problem when reading back the stored keys from indexeddb, as the connection to the original key instance is lost along the way, and the keys can no longer be used with the web crypto api. can you say anything about if it would be possible to support this? i would be more than happy to work on a pr for this, but i'm a bit at a loss for where to start. best, mikkel
