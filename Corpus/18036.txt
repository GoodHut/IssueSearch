 URL : "https://github.com/ArjunBhuptani/HappyPayNPM/issues/2" TITLE : set up initialize BODY : create initialize function which abstracts away key and secret management. the function should be called once after importing the module into an external happypay.js file and should return a happychain object which contains all subsequent functions with the key and secret fields already filled in. this also reduces the risk of leaked credentials.
