 URL : "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-cpp/issues/558" TITLE : unable to parse error BODY : i see this has been discussed before, and was addressed in an earlier code version. but i just received this error unable to parse exceptionname: internalerror message: we encountered an internal error. please try again. using v1.0.133 of awssdkcpp with an ubuntu ec2 image. ! image https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/619043/26550850/af7bacb2-444d-11e7-81f7-4c4165095e20.png i've looked at the comments/issues here and some have said this error emanates from the s3 side. is there something i should do in my code to retry? is there a way to have the awssdkcpp automatically retry or increase an existing retry count? what are the recommended steps to gracefully recover?
