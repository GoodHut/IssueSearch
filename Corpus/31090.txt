 URL : "https://github.com/crayfishx/puppet-firewalld/issues/155" TITLE : rich rule port hash BODY : i'm not sure if this is an issue, or a misconfiguration on my part. apologies if i'm in error, but this is the way i understand the documentation. the port value is to be a hash under rich rules. in my hiera data i have this: firewalld::rich_rules: 'mcafee agent communication': ensure: present source: 10.10.10.50 port: port: 8803 protocol: 'tcp' zone: public action: 'accept' however, in my public.xml zone file i see this: <rule family= ipv4 > <source address= 10.10.10.50 /> <accept/> </rule> i do not get any errors when running puppet agent -t however, i also do not get the port/protocol values to come through. please advise when time permits. thank you! -cs
