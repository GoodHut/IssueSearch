 URL : "https://github.com/gimli-org/gimli/issues/77" TITLE : rewrite fdem manager BODY : the fdem manager was the first manager created years ago, actually for managing long profiles e.g. measured by ground em systems like maxmin or airborne systems like resolve . furthermore, it does not comply at all with the modern manager structure. similar to the surface nmr managers mrs one magnetic resonance sounding and mrsprofile several soundings along a profile, for laterally constrained inversion i suggest creating a simple sounding manager class fdem based on the methodmanager1d rename the old class to fdemprofile and make use of the fdem class create an fdem example in the example section doing modelling and inversion with the manager maybe we could eventually create a manager base class for administrating profile measurements and controlling inversion through an lci actually a continuously constrained framework so that only method-specific stuff e.g. plotting of profile data needs to be added.
