 URL : "https://github.com/hbt/functionshub/issues/4" TITLE : inv docker http cache BODY : current: docker already caches image layer after it builds it. problem is, internet connection sucks on some server, i'm downloading stuff at 5.5mb from the ubuntu repo when i have a 100 mb connection. desired: why the fuck are we not caching those http requests on a cdn or something? i want to download stuff super fast and only waste my time compiling libraries and extracting packages until i figure out a way to distribute that computation somehow related: checkout out https://docs.docker.com/engine/examples/apt-cacher-ng/ i'm pretty sure someone on the internet already raised this issue. google around and find the right keywords. look for docker image building services that accelerate or other docker tools to accelerate the process.
