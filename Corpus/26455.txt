 URL : "https://github.com/mcohen01/amazonica/issues/345" TITLE : aws config role_arn BODY : does amazonica support utilizing role_arn's from profiles within ~/.aws/config ? in my ~/.aws/config i have a role_arn in a profile declaration that lets me access the api of one account using access/secret keys from another account: default region = us-east-1 profile foo role_arn = arn:aws:iam::58823005882300:role/foobar source_profile = default from the command line i am able to specify a profile that i would like to utilize like below: aws route53 list-hosted-zones-by-name --profile foo this successfully fetches results. i have tried passing the following combinations as credential maps to list-hosted-zones to attempt to leverage the arn defined within the profile in ~/.aws/config without any luck: {:profile foo } {:profile arn:aws:iam::58823005882300:role/foobar } {:role_arn arn:aws:iam::58823005882300:role/foobar } {:role arn:aws:iam::58823005882300:role/foobar } {:access-key aws-access-key :secret-key aws-secret-key :profile arn:aws:iam::58823005882300:role/foobar } {:access-key aws-access-key :secret-key aws-secret-key :profile foo } if this is supported, what would the correct incantation be to leverage the role_arn from the profile in ~/.aws/config?
