 URL : "https://github.com/tillmo/DOL/issues/372" TITLE : new refs are confusing BODY : to give an example in section d.1 it says the metaclass text nr24, 12.2 is a subclass ... this is confusing, because it seems that the metaclass is called text nr24 . surely this is supposed to be a citation. it should say something like the metaclass text see nr24, section 12.2 is a subclass ... the same is true for the new refs in section c.2. it may have happened in other places.
