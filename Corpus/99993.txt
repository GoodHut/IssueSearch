 URL : "https://github.com/bryancatanzaro/generics/issues/1" TITLE : note: performance of __ldg BODY : i tested your __ldg implementation on a titan-x pascal with cuda 8.0 to handle vec2 items. i found this reduced performance of the entire kernel by 2.5x compared to using __ldg on the individual float components in my latency/memory bound kernel. unusually the profiler's pc sampling listed the stalls as memory dependency, but gave them the colour of synchronisation stall. i realise the repo is untouched in 3 years, not expecting any updates, just leaving a note incase anyone else is going to use it blindly.
