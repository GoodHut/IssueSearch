 URL : "https://github.com/maxlath/wikidata-sdk/issues/15" TITLE : entity/item naming issue BODY : in helpers such as iswikidataentityid https://github.com/maxlath/wikidata-sdk/blob/master/lib/helpers/helpers.js l6 the term entity is wrongly used to designate items . also, we could drop the wikidata part in most helpers names given it's a lib about wikidata. both changes would constitute breaking changes.
