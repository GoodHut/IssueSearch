BODY : what is the min resolution in the g4 dwell command? is it supposed to be 1ms e.g. g4 p0.001 or better or ? i'm using grbl v1.1e on a nano to control a laser cutter. almost standard build with the exception of laser mode enabled. i was trying to debug another issue when i noticed that the g4 command appears to only resolve in increments of 50ms. is this correct? e.g. p0.001, p0.010, p0.035, p0.050 = 50ms actual dwell time p0.060, p0.075, p0.010 = 100ms actual dwell time p1.001, p1.035, p1.045 = 1050ms actual dwell time. how i got to conclusion was i ran the simple test code below and observed d11 on a scope, only changing the the dwell time between various tests and capturing the pulse duration . g0 x0 y0 m3 s0 g1 x1 y1 f3000 m3 s255 note $30=255 so laser at max here, not pwming g4 p0.001 m5 am i missing something or is this intended behaviour?
