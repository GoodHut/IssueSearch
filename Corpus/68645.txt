 URL : "https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/kargo/issues/1050" TITLE : selinux disabling fails BODY : when the selinux module attempts to set to 'permissive', and some foolish sysadmin has outright deleted selinux, the module fails. i have a simple check in 1049 that first checks for the existence of /etc/selinux/config and conditionally executes the module. this is only an issue on ansible_os_family == 'redhat'
