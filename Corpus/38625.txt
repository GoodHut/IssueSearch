 URL : "https://github.com/mailgun/mailgun-ruby/issues/124" TITLE : problems with v1.1.8 BODY : i recently updated to v1.1.8 of this gem from v1.1.6 and my code started to fail. i tracked it down to the pagination that seems to be buggy. what i'm doing is getting the delivered events for two of my domains: mailgun = mailgun::client.new %w domain1.com domain2.com .each do |domain| mailgun_events = mailgun::events.new mailgun, domain events = mailgun_events.get event: 'delivered' .to_h 'items' while events.any? events.each do |event| do something with the event end events = mailgun_events.next.to_h 'items' end end what started happening is that not only delivered , but all events were returned from the api. when i downgraded to v1.1.6 again, the error went away. i assume the bug is somewhere in here: https://github.com/mailgun/mailgun-ruby/commit/9ad5cbd95f2570b3a3c681cc1e362c702b84eded diff-e904dd8e3437a9a9c5e35c6dcb227d30
