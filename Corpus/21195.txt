 URL : "https://github.com/geoffhumphrey/brewcompetitiononlineentry/issues/763" TITLE : entry addition bug BODY : when all entries are assigned and checked as being paid/received, i updated the entries and one of the entries that was already assigned a judging number pops up with the number 000000 and the paid/received buttons unchecked. this continues to happen. i created a test entry and assigned it the judging number 000000 and that fixed the system from arbitrarily assigning an entry to this number. however, after checking off paid/received, saving it and going back to sort on paid or received selections, the system keeps un-checking at least one entry.
