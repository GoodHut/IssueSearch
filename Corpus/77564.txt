 URL : "https://github.com/cadon/ARKStatsExtractor/issues/470" TITLE : nice to have suggestions BODY : hi cadon, working a little bit with the great application and ocr i have a few suggestions: - reading the raised by : this field could be saved or used as owner if the owner is not present. the owner field is not always present as it depends on the tribe settings. - mutation tracking: mutations play an important role to get the perfect tame. currently it's only possible to set the number of mutations, i would suggest to add the possibility to be able to track the type of mutation. tracking this information would enable a lot more possibilities: -- mutations could automatically be inhereted if parents are selected -- stat-mutations could be auto-detected after selecting the parents -- dino color mutations could be tracked entered manually at first occurrence -- mutations could be added better in the breeding plan for now they are because of the higher stat, but eg. if i have a dino with 42 lvl + mutation and one with 44 lvl without mutation, the one without mutation can be prefered
