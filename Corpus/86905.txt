 URL : "https://github.com/CESNET/SecurityCloudGUI/issues/16" TITLE : inconsistent time formats BODY : there are several different time formats used within gui: - 16 jan 2017 - 14:00 in the date field under the graph and 16 jan on the x-axis of the graph - jan 16 2017 14:00 in the box with selected timeslot/interval, and in the header of statistics page - 2017-01-16 14:00:00.123 in the database query results it should be consistent. preferably the iso format, i.e. 2017-10-16 14:00 . also, there is some inconsistency with time zones. when i select a time slot 14:00 and query the database, the resulting flows have timestamps around 13:00. it seems that gui uses local time but fdistdump prints times in utc. it should either be unified this may need changes in fdistdump or at least the timezone information should be clearly communicated to user.
