BODY : hi, i don't have a whole ton of knowledge about the ds games' support past the fact that sinnoh games aren't supported. i've tried heartgold, black and black 2. when i select pksm from homebrew, i scroll through the applications that are shown and none of the ds games show up. i have an older 3ds and the 3ds games always show up, i'm also on the latest version of pksm.
