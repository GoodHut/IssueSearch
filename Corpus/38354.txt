 URL : "https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage/issues/368" TITLE : path lookups failing BODY : date you used cookiecutter pypackage: 9/15/2017 cookiecutter version used, if any: 1.5.1 python version, if any: 3.6.2 operating system: osx description if this is the most popular module i would expect things to work out of the gate.. is this not the case? i created a new project called experiments to play around and learn a bit of python. i thought of using cookiecutter to get a project set up with best practices to learn a bit faster. however, i'm unable to even resolve packages. it seems like i'm doing something fundamentally wrong, or python's path lookup is just a bit obtuse. what i did project structure in ~/src/experiments : ./experiments/ |__ ./cli.py |__ ./main.py pyenv/ virutalenv cli.py code: import click from experiments.resourcetype import resource_type from experiments.main import testclass @click.command def main args=none : console script for experiments. test = testclass if __name__ == __main__ : main error: python ./experiments/cli.py traceback most recent call last : file ./experiments/cli.py , line 8, in <module> from experiments.main import testclass modulenotfounderror: no module named 'experiments.main' python --version python 3.6.2 what's going on here? this seems like a fundamental error for a boilerplate project that has a lot of people on it. am i missing some python thing that is not documented?
