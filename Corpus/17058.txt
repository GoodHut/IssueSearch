 URL : "https://github.com/bodymovin/bodymovin/issues/282" TITLE : need help staging BODY : hello, i am fairly new to coding and the bodymovin extension for after effects. i have successfully rendered the animation into a demo file, however when i try to load it through a json file it won't show up on my page. if someone could please show me how to replace the svg icon in my file with the animated version, that would be awesome! i've attached the ae file and demo files as well. i added a grey background to the demo so you could actually see it. if you need to re-render it, make sure its the composition named strategic_consulting_icon any help would be greatly appreciated! bodymovin_files.zip https://github.com/bodymovin/bodymovin/files/794352/bodymovin_files.zip
