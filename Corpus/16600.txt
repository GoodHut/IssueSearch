 URL : "https://github.com/Servir-Mekong/ecodash/issues/8" TITLE : kml not uploading BODY : not sure if this is due to a size issue / number of nodes o the polygon or what--or if there is a known node limit for gee poly uploads. could also be a header issue i imported this into google earth from an esri shapefile and then saved as a kml . i've attached the polygon i tried to use here for trouble shooting. its a kmz but i've used the .zip suffix to be able to upload it here. - pete
