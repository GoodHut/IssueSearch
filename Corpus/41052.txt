 URL : "https://github.com/mapbox/batfish/issues/86" TITLE : why the data option? BODY : is the intention behind the data to replace imports of static site data as-needed in individual pages? right now many mapbox react apps have a data/ dir that we then pull data from where we need it, like: js var mapstyles = require 'data/map-styles.json i am a little skeptical of the approach â€“ it seems to add complexity to this workflow.
