 URL : "https://github.com/NEU-Libraries/cerberus/issues/1094" TITLE : spreadsheet load error BODY : i just triggered a spreadsheet error, which was definitely my fault. i submitted a community pid instead of a collection pid on the load submission screen. the community pid was accepted, and i made it through the metadata confirmation page. once i confirmed the metadata and started the load, i encountered the first error: ! 2017-05-10_0936 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4663073/25901373/9b1f60f8-3564-11e7-894e-56e679ae6fa4.png i realized right away that i submitted the community rather than the collection, so i went back to the my loader page to try again with the collection pid instead, but i encountered another system error: ! 2017-05-10_0936-1 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4663073/25901409/bd1adbf6-3564-11e7-8453-18f015d32925.png i should have submitted the correct pid originally, but i also probably shouldn't have been able to make it as far i did with a community pid.
