 URL : "https://github.com/UprootLabs/unplug/issues/14" TITLE : handle api errors BODY : the code for handling errors is actually present. but the errors from the api are not being propagated to the next level. they throw an exception rather than return an error as the higher level expects . for example, api.createroom should return a null when there is an error, so that caller can process the error properly.
