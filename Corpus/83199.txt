 URL : "https://github.com/xavierh/minecolonies/issues/10" TITLE : build: biome specific hut BODY : we should be able to customized a build on the fly according to the biome where the townhall is build. for instance, if i build in my town hall in a roofed forest my primary wood should be dark oak. when creating a new build all the oak wood would be replaced by dark oak wood, the oak wood plank by dark oak plank and so one. we just need to create a translation mechanism which take a standard nbt file and translated it to the biome specific version
