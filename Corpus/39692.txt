 URL : "https://github.com/crudlio/crudl/issues/42" TITLE : specify multiple api BODY : hello all, first of all thank you for this wonderful project, i find the concept very interesting. i have several micro/api-only services one for manage users, another for managing products, etc... and i'd like to unify their admin interface into a centralized one. this way we have both the flexibility of microservices and the comfort of a unique interface for administrators. this is how i found crudl, and i believe it's a very good place to start, the only thing is it's look like we can specify only one api. is there any way to specify several ? do you believe this feature shall be on the roadmap ? if not i think i'll just have to build a centralized api which will get together the other ones, so no real big deal, but i wanted to share my issue with you to know your thoughts. have a nice day!
