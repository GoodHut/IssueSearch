 URL : "https://github.com/ProofGeneral/PG/issues/205" TITLE : automatic bullet insertion BODY : feature request: implement an optional mode, when current bulltet is finished the next one is automatically opened. this could be controlled by coq output, as seen in respose buffer: lemma insert_perm: forall x l, permutation x::l insert x l . proof. induction l. - constructor. constructor. - simpl. destruct x <=? a . + apply permutation_refl. end of branch in response buffer it says: this subproof is complete, but there are some unfocused goals. focus next goal with bullet +. at this point i would like pg to automatically insert properly indented + bullet.
