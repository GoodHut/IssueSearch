 URL : "https://github.com/sobrus/FastLacellsGenerator/issues/5" TITLE : ocid doesn't work anymore BODY : opencellid has a new owner now since the beginning of april , and it seems fastlacellsgenerator cannot generate database from ocid data anymore. i get the gzip: stdin: not in gzip format error. and ocid.csv file in /tmp remains 0 byte, while mozilla.csv file size increases when the script is running .
