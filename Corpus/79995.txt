 URL : "https://github.com/tangrams/walkabout-style/issues/145" TITLE : support of contour lines BODY : beautiful map style you have here, however for now i am missing contour lines, that show the elevation. for instance if you go to https://geojson.io and check the _ocm_ style than you see helpful contour lines all over the place on a bigger scale. is it possible to also have it for this style? thx for the great things you are doing!
