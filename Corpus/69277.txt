 URL : "https://github.com/zhchsf/redis_cluster/issues/9" TITLE : support for redis-rb 4+ BODY : nice work on this one. thanks! redis-rb now has version 4 and above in their gem https://github.com/redis/redis-rb/blob/master/changelog.md 40 and this gem restricts by coupling to ~> 3.2 . i assume that's mostly unintentional and that it might be possible to loosen this constraint a bit. redis-rb 4.0's major change seems to be that support for ruby < 2.2.2 has been dropped; aside from that it mostly contains a few removals of deprecated methods. with any luck, it should be pretty easy to support. unrelatedly, are you or do you know of anyone else using this in a production environment? this seems to be the best-supported redis cluster gem out there, but even so it doesn't seem to be seeing all that much activity although maybe that's just because it's so stable ; . thanks!
