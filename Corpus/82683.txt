 URL : "https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/issues/2434" TITLE : anisotropic cost distance BODY : while developing 2432, it was quickly realized that a tobler friction surface is useless if we cannot account for direction of travel. it is, of course, easier to walk downhill than uphill, and we should be able to compute the walking time from a given source point to the local neighborhood, for example, with this fact in mind. as suggested in 2433, one possible solution is to allow a multiband friction surface where each band is the friction when traveling to/from a cell in a given direction. of course, other solutions may be better-suited to our cost-distance implementation.
