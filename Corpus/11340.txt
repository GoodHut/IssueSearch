 URL : "https://github.com/mxcl/PromiseKit/issues/734" TITLE : go back one step BODY : promisekit version: 4.4 i have a series of uiviewcontrollers popups in my app that i use to gather information from the end user. i managed to chain them with promises like this: firstly { return showfirstpopup } .then { info1 -> promise<info2> in dismissfirstpopup //do sth with info1... return showsecondpopup } .then { info2 -> promise<info3> in dismisssecondpopup //do sth with info2... return showthirdpopup } .then { info3 -> promise<info4> in dismissthirdpopup //do sth with info3... return showforthpopup } ... .catch { error in //handle any error or cancellation... } if, for example, the user presses back in the third popup i need to go back to the previous then and not cancel the whole flow. basically i need to be able to go back one step, let the user edit the data, then continue the flow. is there a way to do this with promisekit?
