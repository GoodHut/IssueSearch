 URL : "https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/2276" TITLE : bower dependency behaviour BODY : hello, i have a project with uikit as a dependency in bower.json file, pointing to version 2.27.2. sometimes, when using bower install to install dependencies, and try to build the project, i get an error for some missing files under src directory . i don't know why is this happening since i always point to the same uikit version on my bower file. i found out this issue seems to be happening when you bump version, but don't know if it might be related. as an abstract, uikit v2.27.2 bower dependency, when installing it with bower install , sometimes includes src directory, and sometimes it does not. is that something i am missing? my uikit bower.json entry is: uikit : 2.27.2 help would be greatly appreciated, this is driving me crazy :
