 URL : "https://github.com/moment/luxon/issues/86" TITLE : flow typing idea BODY : hi ! we are thinking about migrating our project from moment to this one because of the immutability, better debuggable code, better api . at the moment, only one thing would require some work : flow type definition. i was just wondering if you thought of using flow annotation in your source or at least provide a flow definition in the published package ? ps: if i may give you a raw feedback from our team about the naming : we did not understand the relation between a luxon and datetime/calendar. it might be an obstacle for the adoption of this package that is theorically better than moment.js on almost every subject... thanks!
