 URL : "https://github.com/shieldgenerator7/Stoned_Unity/issues/175" TITLE : adjust wall jump level BODY : - make a wall over the pit to keep players from walking nimbly across the cracked ground
- make pit deeper so there can be a long wall that makes it more obvious it's not just a super jump
- make an entrance to boulder chute so you can play with the boulders - remove ufo/hide it better
- make puzzle for the upside down boulders
