 URL : "https://github.com/mikaelbr/gulp-notify/issues/117" TITLE : time in utc BODY : hi, my issue is simple but i don't have a clue on how to deal with it :/ there is an example: in french bash dev@dev ~/test $> bash lundi 6 mars 2017, 17:23:35 utc+0100 dev@dev ~/test $> gulp 16:23:40 gulp-notify: sass compiled your css files are ready sir. js ... .pipe $.notify { title: sass compiled , message: your css files are ready sir. , onlast: true } ... you can see that the time sent by gulp-notify is the utc time. is there a solution to make gulp-notify use my timezone instead ? or should i just add 1 hour to my time ⭕️✖️❌ best regards,
