 URL : "https://github.com/itinero/routing/issues/127" TITLE : routerpoint - not to pass BODY : would it be possible to have a property dontpass for routerpoints? usecase would be, that sometimes we need a route from a to c, which is not passing b, even if b would be on the direct route, we would need another route.
