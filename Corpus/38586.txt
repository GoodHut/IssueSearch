 URL : "https://github.com/daisy/pipeline/issues/506" TITLE : problem finding lame BODY : i've noticed that the pipeline can't find lame when it is installed via homebrew and the pipeline is launched via the mac app. my first guess is that the java launcher inside the application bundle changes the path variable. an additional issue is that the configuration file doesn't seem to work like it should according to the documentation . the following property does not seem to have any effect: xml <config> <property key= lame.path value= /usr/local/bin/lame /> </config> greg kearney is experiencing the same problem see email on dev mailing list .
