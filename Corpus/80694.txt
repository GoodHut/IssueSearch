 URL : "https://github.com/adam-paterson/oauth2-stripe/issues/7" TITLE : update client dependency BODY : can this package be updated to depend on the 2. version of league/oauth2-client ? i hate opening an issue without a pr but i'm not sure what's involved. i've forked this repo and simply updated the composer dependency - everything seemed to work great. i don't know if there's anything else to be done.
