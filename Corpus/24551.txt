 URL : "https://github.com/GlitchCog/ChatGameFontificator/issues/11" TITLE : support new badges BODY : since twitch prime and subscriber loyalty badges https://blog.twitch.tv/more-badges-more-plumage-deck-out-your-community-with-loyalty-badges-dcb71602c24 were introduced, twitch changed their badge api to something else. the badge api is documented here: https://discuss.dev.twitch.tv/t/beta-badge-api/6388 i've got some improvements for it, but they're on a separate branch /broadstone/chatgamefontificator/tree/newbadges-dev as i don't want to break the existing support. it looks to be quite difficult to support the old badge style while working on a new one.
