 URL : "https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/issues/61" TITLE : timestamps return null BODY : i would like to return the created_at and updated_at timestamps of a model entry. in my graphql type i have added the following fields: php 'created_at' => 'type' => type::string , , 'updated_at' => 'type' => type::string , , if i query those, i receive null . if i add custom resolve functions like this, it all works perfectly: php public function resolvecreatedatfield $root { return string $root->created_at; } naturally i can add those two functions for every type i create, but this seems rather cumbersome. is there something i am missing here, or is this a bug of some sorts?
