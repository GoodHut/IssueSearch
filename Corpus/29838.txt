BODY : i'm wondering if we may have an issue with the mts integrator: stepsperparentstep = substeps//parentsubsteps if stepsperparentstep < 1 or stepsperparentstep != int stepsperparentstep : raise valueerror the number for substeps for each group must be a multiple of the number for the previous group doesn't // indicate floor division, which always returns an integer? thus, isn't the second test always true? imho don't we want to do true division, run the integer check, then explicitly cast to int after the multiplicity check?
