 URL : "https://github.com/OpenLiveWriter/OpenLiveWriter/issues/643" TITLE : olw will not open. BODY : i had not blogged since 4/28 or so and went to launch olw on 6/20. it would not open on my computer. some flickering on the screen and no further. i looked into it a bit and had to move on with my day. the next day i tried to uninstall it, so that i could reinstall it. i've since tried that a few more times. oddly enough, it launches on my laptop. i could not download the newer version, either. i've confirmed all pop-up blockers are off and that it is a trusted site. i've turned off norton.
