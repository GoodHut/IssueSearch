 URL : "https://github.com/nci-ats/fs-middlelayer-api/issues/381" TITLE : address test issues BODY : from sprint 8 review https://github.com/18f/fs-middlelayer-api/pull/28 : - test/test.js is a bit of a generalized file name and could be renamed to something like api-routes or something that better indicates what is under test.- - - does test/test.js l180 reference the header that the security report mentions?
