 URL : "https://github.com/mddub/urchin-cgm/issues/69" TITLE : campy mccamp face BODY : hey, working on integrating urchin with the 600 series uploader for medtronic pumps. first pass is going great and loving the rapid availability of data on the watchface and for offline use. i have sgv, bolus and basal as well as event specific status text ie temps / suspends / running dual and square combos that can be pushed - which is nice and allows the watchface to be a extension of the pump and more then a sgv viewer. what i'm wondering is can urchin prefs be read? this is mainly to get the scale component for scaling the basal data. also when i enter a different menu on the pebble and go back to the watchface is there a way of getting a startup call so that data can be refreshed from the uploader? as it can be blank until the next sgv update. and a few requests: sightly bigger fonts for the status text - hard to read them at times. simple alarm reciever for controler clients like this to send an alarm msg + vibe seq. app mode in the prefs for the endpoint. thanks!
