 URL : "https://github.com/domlysz/BlenderGIS/issues/82" TITLE : cannot install addon BODY : i am trying to install this plugin on blender portable version 2.78. i have downloaded the repo and extracted it. i have gone into blender user preferences and selected install from file . i am now presented with a file explorer where i navigate to the extracted repo. i have tried selecting every script in here and then clicking on the install from file... bottom at the top-right, however i do not see it in the addon list after that. is this the proper procedure to install this or should i be doing something differently? the install guide is very ambiguous, saying only use install from file option to install the addon from downloaded zip
