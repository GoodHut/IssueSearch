 URL : "https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/issues/178" TITLE : svg demo combobox bug BODY : in chrome 58.0.3029.96 the svg builder demo http://mavo.io/demos/svgpath/ url combobox values do not show when it is active. if you hover over the opened combo you can see that there are values there, just not visible until you hover the item. line 190 in style.css sets the color value to white. it does seem to display properly in firefox. mavo is looking pretty cool as a dev tool. thanks lea v!
