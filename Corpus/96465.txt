 URL : "https://github.com/chifflier/nfqueue-rs/issues/3" TITLE : examples fail at assertion BODY : hey there, when trying your library i encountered failed assertions. the assertion in the examples let rc = q.bind libc::af_inet ; fails. if i remove it, the library fails with assertion failed: !self.qqh.is_null ', $home/.cargo/git/checkouts/nfqueue-rs-0ce1560e2a26a188/1ee3e07/src/lib.rs:258 . do you have any advise on how to solve this? extern crate nfqueue; extern crate libc; fn queue_callback msg: &nfqueue::message, state:&mut state { ... } fn main { let mut q = nfqueue::queue::new state::new ; q.open ; q.unbind libc::af_inet ; let rc = q.bind libc::af_inet ; // assert! rc == 0 ; q.create_queue 1, queue_callback ; q.run_loop ; q.close ; }
