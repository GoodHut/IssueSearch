 URL : "https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo.github.io/issues/144" TITLE : link tiles to faq BODY : the new page is nice. however, 2/3 of the page height are now text without any link in between. i was a bit confused that i cannot click on any of the tiles on the main page. i suggest to link all of them to a matching faq entry, to actually back our claims in the tiles.
