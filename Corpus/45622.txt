 URL : "https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/issues/1410" TITLE : improve har recording BODY : currently long responses, media and images are not recorded. sometimes it is impossible to re-ask requests and load content, and this har is useless. is it possible to allow to record everything? add some option for this? . resulting file can be large, so i suggest to add —Åustomizable timeout for har recording or/and add separate notification about it.
