 URL : "https://github.com/onsip/SIP.js/issues/388" TITLE : free the memory! BODY : ua.configuration_skeleton is used during the creation of the ua in order to set the properties of the ua.configuration object. this object is, thus, only needed for a short period of time and should probably not remain in memory even if all values are emptied during the ua lifetime. same goes for ua.configuration_check . why not make these object exist in memory only during the execution of loadconfig ? imo settings and configuration_skeleton should be merged together. and configuration_check should be created at the beginning of loadconfig and be un-referenced afterwards.
