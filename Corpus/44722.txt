 URL : "https://github.com/openvstorage/framework/issues/1719" TITLE : fix framework logging BODY : the logging module for python is completely misconfigured in the framework normal workflow should be that each process instantiates its own logger. then the process itself should be responsible to add a handler to it which in most cases should be our loghandler module and then it can log. depending on the handler and the configurations of the handler, it then logs to console, file or redis a good example of bad configuration is present in our extensions. eg file_mutex this extension creates a logger instance logging.getlogger __name__ , but it doesn't add a handler, so python does not know where to put the logs and falls back to the default our entire framework and related repos should be cleaned up and optimize the logging behavior
