 URL : "https://github.com/psas/liquid-engine-test-stand/issues/41" TITLE : main fuel valve BODY : project : design and build electrically actuated main fuel valve description : the final valve connecting the pressurized fuel line to the test engine needs to be activated and controlled remotely. this project is to design and build a servo / motor driven valve which is capable of opening the main fuel valve. requirements : the valve which has been selected for use as the main fuel valve is a sharpe 39036 1/2 in ball valve. see doc file for specification sheet . constraints: - opening torque for ball valve - 35 in.lb's per manufacturer - power supply - 12v dc or less - for testing, the hardware should be able to be run with an arduino deliverable: the valve needs to be able to be reliably opened and closed. will need to be able to withstand strenuous testing.
