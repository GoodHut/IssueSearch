 URL : "https://github.com/bbyars/mountebank/issues/245" TITLE : allow in-memory lookups BODY : like the csv lookups, allow looking up values from an in-memory object and replacing response tokens. other behaviours could set the values into object. this could implement stateful behaviour: eg: request1 creates session, saves global.whatever sessionid = userid request2 copies global.whatever sessionid into response.body this could be further extended by a predicate using the same set of values . eg: checking for session state etc
