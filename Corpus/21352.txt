 URL : "https://github.com/helton/noiseless/issues/1" TITLE : fade in / fade out BODY : hi helton, do you think it would be possible to adjust noiseless in the following way: when i klick an icon to enable it, just fade from zero to either the last value it had when it was deactivated meaning if i have it on 33% and would disable it, it would - on enabling it again - fade from 0% to 33% . hope i made sense : cheers thomas
