 URL : "https://github.com/rcjsuen/dockerfile-ast/issues/4" TITLE : create tostring functions BODY : while it's possible to gain access to the physical string representation of a given line with gettextcontent , there is no easy way to simply print out its contents ignoring escaped characters and extraneous whitespace and so on. we should add a tostring function to all the relevant classes so that they can easily be translated to something that is human-readable. - argument - comment - flag - instruction - parserdirective - variable
