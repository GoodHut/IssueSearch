 URL : "https://github.com/NeowayLabs/wabbit/issues/7" TITLE : support for go 1.6 BODY : @tiago4orion the build https://travis-ci.org/neowaylabs/wabbit/builds/210049299 on travis have fails 'cuz can not import go-dockerclient. looking for go-dockerclient lib, i just figured out that the support for go 1.6 was removed https://github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient/commit/597128c3e24917d9dd6c47867b902cef3532fc24 . there are no tags more, so we cannot use gopkg : let's remove the support for older go versions too ? what do you think?
