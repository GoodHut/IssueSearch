 URL : "https://github.com/serilog/serilog-settings-configuration/issues/66" TITLE : question about core 2 BODY : so with core 2 moving the logging configuration into program.cs, what is the correct way to read in the configuration for setting logger? the sample here shows just reading from appsettings.json, but the main reason i use the configuration file is so i can vary my config by environment using the environment files. seems like the configuration is not yet available for logging to read it in or am i missing something obvious?
