 URL : "https://github.com/ntop/ntopng/issues/1568" TITLE : mysql and storage full BODY : hi i'm using ntop with -f option to write in database, it works well i have an issue because when partition is full, ntop can't write more and it writes ton of warning in syslog... so partition where syslog is becomes full :- mysqldb.cpp:56 error: mysql error: out of range value for column 'idx' at row 1 rc=-1 nov 14 10:14:38 ntop-racine ntopng: mysqldb.cpp:56 error: mysql error: out of range value for column 'idx' at row 1 rc=-1 so 2 questions 1 why don't you introduce a mechanism which detect when a partition is full and in that case use rotating data in mysql it removes older data to add new ? 2 i tried to reduce mysql storage duration in ntop config, i thought ntop will remove old data to reduce mysql database but nothing happens 3 with the 2 now that i'm full what i can do without adding space ? clear database and i loose all datas ? thanks for your advise nico
