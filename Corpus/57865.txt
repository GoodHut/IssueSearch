 URL : "https://github.com/kittykatattack/ga/issues/64" TITLE : rendering own entities BODY : many games require special entities like backgrounds which are proceduraly generated and rendered. how does one render one's own graphics to the canvas with ga? i think there needs to be some layered way of hooking into ga.render for the engine to allow this. indeed, apropos layers, ga does not seem to care which sprites are at which layer when rendering.
