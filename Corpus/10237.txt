 URL : "https://github.com/hylasoft-usa/h-opc/issues/61" TITLE : browse using da2 BODY : i have a sample code using this library working fine with matrikon opc server for simulation and testing but that fails with matrikon opc server for dde . although its documentation says it supports da3, i confirmed when using other opc .net oss libraries that it works only if i use da2. is it currently possible to switch da2? the underlying opc.connectdata has a alwaysuseda20 property but i don't find a way to set it to true.
