 URL : "https://github.com/Gamer2020/PokemonGameEditor/issues/41" TITLE : auto-complete not working BODY : in older versions of the program 3.6 , when typing a pokemon, attack, etc. the program auto-completed the word. in newer versions 3.8 , auto-complete is not working. for example, when editing attacks in 3.6 if you typed tack the program auto-completed to tackle but in the current version 3.8 typing tack does not auto-complete. also, typing tackle and pressing change attack makes the program crash unless you press continue to the crash window .
