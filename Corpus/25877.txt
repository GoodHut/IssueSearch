 URL : "https://github.com/Intracto/SecretSanta/issues/375" TITLE : add exclusion rules BODY : possible improvement : it would be nice to be able to make some matches impossible, for instance if two people are a couple and do not want to be assigned together. there could be an optional list of unwanted matches with two columns to fill, in which one row corresponds to two participants id/e-mail that must not end up together.
