 URL : "https://github.com/google/error-prone/issues/513" TITLE : build system : fat jar ? BODY : hello. i'd like to try making a git pre-commit http://pre-commit.com hook that invoke error-prone . those hooks are made in python. the easiest to invoke a a java program from python would be to have a fat jar. how simple would it be to generate a fat jar for error-prone ? i did not find instructions to do so in http://errorprone.info/docs/installation, and only source code seems to be provided in releases. regards.
