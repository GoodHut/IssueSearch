 URL : "https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js/issues/4356" TITLE : incorrect color rendering BODY : hello. i ran into strange bug. i think it's depends on the latest updates of the g. chrome or something like that, because it did not appear before. i use the latest version of the pixi.js lib for current time - it's 4.5.6.   when i use the pixi.webglrenderer - colors of all sprite have changed. became dimmer when i use the pixi.canvasrenderer - colors are still right untill i change text in any instance of pixi.text component. ... after that all sprites became dimmer too. for view i'm attaching a screenshot of the color changing and url of this picture on g. drive. ! uploading 123.png… https://drive.google.com/file/d/0b9xc8ta34eqstfnfwmtidml1d1u/view p.s. sorry for my english. :-
