 URL : "https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bip38/issues/27" TITLE : altcoin encrypted wallets? BODY : does this work with altcoins or only bitcoin? there's a comment in the code with a todo about being bitcoin only? i seem to get different values when i encrypt and decrypt a private key i have generated for my altcoin using your other library. the wif private key and public keys generated are correct and working, just this bip38 encrypt / decyrpt gives me different values.. also, i had to write the code different from your examples. it was complaining that bip38 was not a contstructor. so here's my code var version = { private: 0x96, public: 0x35 } var bytes = securerandom.randombuffer 32 var key = new coinkey bytes, version var decoded = wif.decode key.privatewif bip38.version = version; var encryptedkey = bip38.encrypt decoded.privatekey, decoded.compressed, 'mypassword', function status { console.log 'encrypting', math.round status.percent , '%' } var decryptedkey = bip38.decrypt encryptedkey, 'mypassword', function status { console.log 'decrypting', math.round status.percent , '%' } console.log wif.encode decryptedkey, decryptedkey.compressed , key.privatewif, decryptedkey, encryptedkey and the output: 12dspqskogz4ytllvavxlmtt5cmbkn1nyeplb5u6hpoveljvp2d2 pdcta3vg4kqh95kzsxhuktewqnvsyygqxuptxdsjmarfszxxfvpc object {privatekey: uint8array 32 , compressed: true} 6pylsbpwglhrtzfreff4phqk9yb3ilctoxb8ehbvmipfmesqxazdiftcod i thought the output of the wif.encode should match key.privatewif?
