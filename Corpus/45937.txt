 URL : "https://github.com/olifolkerd/tabulator/issues/269" TITLE : issuses, and new bugs BODY : hello! thank you for your continued work, i would like to bring some bugs to your attention: 1. first of all, new problem with version 2.12 there appears to be a perfomance hit, whenever i load a large data set about 200 rows into the table, it appears that the cpu is rising to 10-30% usage which does not happen in tabulator 2.11. ways to reproduce: browser: firefox 50.0 ,did not check weather it happens in chrome, note maybe this happens because i use firebug, but it didn't happen with tabulator 2.11 either way, perhaps your new way of parsing the data is over tasking the browser? 2. it appears that bower still did not update to tabulator 2.12 last time i brought this to your attention you mentioned that it might take a day, i think almost a week has passed? maybe there is a problem? thank you for your continued work! nothing in the list is urgent to me right now but i thought it might be helpful to bring it to your attention, cheers!
