 URL : "https://github.com/mscdex/node-ftp/issues/175" TITLE : uploading a directory? BODY : i think put input, destpath, usecompression seems to be for files only. i need to upload a directory, including all sub directories and files, and the directory structure will be many levels deep. is there a method for uploading a directory that i'm missing in the docs..? i ask because i imagine this is a very common task when ftp'ing. or is my only option to write my own recursive function..?
