 URL : "https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/MyEtherWallet/issues/46" TITLE : get hmr working BODY : right now any change to a component forces a reload from hmr, apparently not knowing how to update. looks like we're on react-hot-loader v3 beta which says that the hot loading api is no longer handled automatically, and that we need to manually hook it up: https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/tree/master/docs migration-to-30. see the notes about <appcontainer/> and module.hot.accept . i was unable to get this working by specifically specifying dependencies in common/index.js , i.e. diff if module.hot { + module.hot.accept 'components', => renderroot root ; module.hot.accept 'reducers/index', => store.replacereducer require 'reducers/index' .default ; } however i _was_ able to get it working by simply doing a blanket accept, and letting <appcontainer/> do its thing. however, this seemed potentially dangerous, as i don't really know what this is doing wrt the redux store or component state: diff if module.hot { + module.hot.accept ; module.hot.accept 'reducers/index', => store.replacereducer require 'reducers/index' .default ; }
