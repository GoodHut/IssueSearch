 URL : "https://github.com/pawelniewie/social-authentication-for-atlassian/issues/40" TITLE : additional log output BODY : i have configured openid on our jira instance and all seems to work as expected except the final step of authenticating within jira. if i set the allowed domains to our domain, i get the message: your email address is not on a list of allowed domains. please use a different account to log in. if i unset allowed domains , i get the message: no existing user was matched. cannot proceed. please try again using different method. i know my email address exists in a jira user account and the domain for it is correct. how can i troubleshoot this further? is there any way to increase the log level? to see the email address or domain the plug-in claims is invalid?
