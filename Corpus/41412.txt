 URL : "https://github.com/mattharrison/IllustratedPy3/issues/129" TITLE : 17 preface suggestion BODY : in the section where you introduce functions the following reasoning is given: > if we have code that we repeatedly run in our program, rather than just copying and pasting it, we >can put it in a function once, then call that function multiple times. this gives us less code to >reason about, making our programs easier to understand i would like to suggest adding in that it also makes tweaking the code later easier as it's only in one location.
