BODY : @drufball @bfgeek question from @paullewis: js // tasklet.js export dostuff x { console.log x.athing ; // prints lol console.log x.anotherthing ; // ??? } ; // main.js function myobj { this.athing = 'lol'; } myobj.prototype.anotherthing = 'kek'; const obj = new myobj console.log obj.athing ; // prints lol console.log obj.anotherthing ; // print kek const api = await tasklet.addmodule 'tasklet.js' ; api.dostuff obj ; will this work? my take: this would inconsistent with other apis like postmessage or indexdb, but since this api is about convenience, it’s at least worth talking about. once you define functions on the prototype, it would break clone-ability once you define functions on the prototype, so i am worried about causing more confusion when used with classes. maybe more for a user-land library? however: we should keep in mind that people are gonna straight to the vdom use-case stuff, so we should maybe write a mock-up of the dom-in-tasklet library we’ve been theorizing about.
