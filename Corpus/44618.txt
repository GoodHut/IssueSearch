 URL : "https://github.com/FACN1/week4-D-REEM-TEAM/issues/41" TITLE : files on client side? BODY : you've put render/eventlistener/request functions in different files 🗄 on the client side, but none if it is actually modularised? i guess this still separates 🗂 out the code for readability 📖 but everything is global 🌏 and accessible which could cause issues. for example: var inputfield = document.getelementbyid 'autocompleteinput' ; this line appears here https://github.com/facn1/week4-d-reem-team/blob/master/public/render.js l2 and here https://github.com/facn1/week4-d-reem-team/blob/master/public/userlistener.js l1 . in this case they are exactly the same so one is redundant, but if the variable name 📛 was the same you would probably run 🏃 into trouble somewhere.
