 URL : "https://github.com/dask/dask-kubernetes/issues/41" TITLE : add credentials command BODY : currently we set the kubectl credentials when creating a cluster, but that only remains valid so long as credentials are not set elsewhere. should provide a command to set for a given cluster, for users that wish to use kubectl directly. a possible alternative would be to report the kubetnetes context for a cluster, since passing --context to kubectl will work without explicitly fetching credentials. probably should provide both.
