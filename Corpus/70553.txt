 URL : "https://github.com/fnl/segtok/issues/11" TITLE : why doesn't this split? BODY : in 37 : from segtok.segmenter import split_single in 38 : list split_single 'folding beijing by hao jingfang' out 38 : 'folding beijing by hao jingfang' i can't figure out why this one does not split into two i would expect 'folding beijing', 'by hao jingfang' . list split_single 'a b c' seems to split ok with 'a', 'b', 'c' as result. great work! thanks a lot. nltk and textblob dont play well with cxfreeze, giving me a headache...
