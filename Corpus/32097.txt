 URL : "https://github.com/LoneGazebo/Community-Patch-DLL/issues/3065" TITLE : tradition and walls BODY : _1. mod version i.e date - 4/23 :_2-10 _2. mod list if using vox populi only, leave blank :_ _3. error description:_ watching a game in observer mode. large map, 11 civs, communitas map. some nations still ignore building a wall, even when bordering a strong hostile neigbour or in a coastal city. Ð°fter looking at it a bit longer i discovered a pattern. all these civs are tradition civs. normaly walls or higher are built in their capital, but many important and vulnerable cities stay without walls until either pretty late in game 19th century or so or until the city is easily captured by an enemy. apologies for reporting it again. it seems this issue hasn't been resolved by the latest patch. ! 20170211083526_1 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16341598/22856040/ca111cf6-f092-11e6-978d-03ffac275156.jpg ! 20170211183040_1 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16341598/22856055/efa86a46-f092-11e6-8e87-7e98ca616555.jpg ! 20170211185224_1 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16341598/22856057/fab2e0ba-f092-11e6-9d31-990d8618f0d3.jpg ! 20170211192640_1 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16341598/22856059/0395744a-f093-11e6-803e-ae9d7bf38937.jpg ! 20170211193235_1 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16341598/22856062/0c77b69a-f093-11e6-9b5f-af9fd8383247.jpg
