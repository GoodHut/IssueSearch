 URL : "https://github.com/nextcloud/android/issues/790" TITLE : remove auto upload BODY : i posted this on nextcloud site, but this is probably more appropriate. i have recently updated my samsung s7 to android 7.0 and with it the nextcloud app somehow also updated . the recent 1.4.2 update added the auto upload feature, which i dislike very much. i do not want my videos and photo files to be going to the same directory. i cannot now separate the upload of video to wifi only. i want the pics to be uploaded at all times, while video only on wifi. 1.4.2 broke that. before android 7.0 came out, i downgraded the nextcloud to 1.4.1 and restored the ability to upload separately. however, now that the system updated i gained the auto upload, no matter what i do. i even tried to downgrade to 1.4.0, and still see that retched auto upload feature. so, my question is, how do i re-enable the ability to select separate folders for video and photo, and the ability to upload different files over cellular or wifi? thank you, lev
