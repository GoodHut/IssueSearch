 URL : "https://github.com/facebookincubator/prophet/issues/71" TITLE : please tag releases BODY : now there have been updates after the 0.1 release, it'd be useful if the 0.1 version had a tag so we can see exactly what repo state was pushed to cran and pypi as which version numbers. could you please create a release https://github.com/facebookincubator/prophet/releases/new for 0.1 and maintain them going forward?
