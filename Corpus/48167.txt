 URL : "https://github.com/africanmathsinitiative/R-Instat/issues/3670" TITLE : rename data frame bug BODY : i think we agreed this is for 0.4.1. in dlgrenamedataframe, the user currently can not rename the label without renaming the data set if they try to just call the data set the same name as the current name, then an error comes up. as a result, this has been disabled in testok for now.
