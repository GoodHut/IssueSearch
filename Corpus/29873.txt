 URL : "https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost-CLI/issues/191" TITLE : mysql user creation BODY : to simplify and secure the mysql handling in the cli and in ghost itself, it is a good idea to configure ghost with a mysql user that only has privileges for the exact database that ghost requires. what ghost-cli will need to do is prompt for the mysql _root_ username and password as well as a database to use for ghost itself it already does this , but after doing that run raw mysql commands to create that database and another database with a _backup suffix to be used as a part of 153 , then create a ghost mysql user that only has permissions for those two databases on localhost. the password for this ghost user will be an auto-generated random alphanumeric string it will be put in config-<env>.json so if the user wants to know what the password is, it will be there . this should hopefully ensure a good, secure solution for the mysql connection.
