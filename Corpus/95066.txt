 URL : "https://github.com/rubenv/angular-gettext/issues/341" TITLE : convert to json on the fly BODY : hi, the project is very cool and easy to use thanks a lot. i have a question: currently, when adding a new translation, developer has to run the grunt/gulp task to create the json file. i would like to generate the json file on the fly . in my app, i have a specific page for translators, so they can upload their translations via the app. in order to do it, i suppose i have to upload a json file or at least create the json on server side. i see that the json format is very specific. do you have an idea? ps: server side is in python. thank you
