 URL : "https://github.com/thatisuday/ng-image-gallery/issues/64" TITLE : thumbnails in inline view BODY : why do thumbnails get removed in the in-line view? i think this is useful to have as this also is a common pattern in any product image gallery. also when in in-line view why does the modal view have to be disabled ? why not both? in-line gallery with thumbnails that can open a modal also it's a pretty common pattern and it's already done in the library so why disable.
