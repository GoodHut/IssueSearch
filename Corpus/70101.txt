 URL : "https://github.com/aomran/ember-cli-chart/issues/78" TITLE : updating data & options BODY : so from what i've read, it seems with the use of chartjs 2.0+, chart.js should just automatically determine what data values have changed and then animate the change to those new values rather than doing the entire initial load animation . similarly, from chartjs 2.5+, the same should occur with options. using ember-cli-charts with 3.3.0 should have both of these features since it uses chartjs 2.6. due to this new feature, updating data/options in ember-cli-chart has been simplified down to essentially just javascript chart.config.data = data; chart.config.options = options; chart.update ; however, at least for me, it seems that it doesn't work at all. when some value in data changes, it replaces the entire chart.config.data with the new data which causes the animation to reload from the beginning rather than just animating the changed value . similarly, changing a single option and then replacing the entire chart.config.options actually doesn't seem to apply the new options at all. the following example snippets work though, if they are placed in the update chart function of ember-cli-chart instead of the existing chart.config.data = data; and chart.config.options = options; statements; changing data javascript mychart.config.data.datasets 0 .data = 36, 19, 3, 5, 2, 3 ; changing options javascript mychart.config.options.legend = { display: true, position: 'bottom' }; or mychart.config.options.legend.position = 'bottom'; am i missing something here? is this working for anyone else? thanks
