 URL : "https://github.com/elves/elvish/issues/337" TITLE : partial path completion BODY : in zsh, if you type /u/sh <kbd>tab</kbd>, it will be completed to /usr/share . it would be nice to have the same feature in elvish. unresolved question: if there're several matching paths, should completion mode be run on parts of the path like in zsh , or should it show all matching paths? i'd like the later, so you could type //sha <kbd>tab</kbd> and choose /usr/share .
