 URL : "https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native/issues/1128" TITLE : issues with uikit sample BODY : hi guys, i've just downloaded 0.4.0 from the release page and wanted to test the uikit sample. unfortunately i run into some trouble: i changed the bundle id and use my provision profile. after i run, i got a error that the konan plugin can't be found. i fixed it by adding gradle buildscript { repositories { mavencentral maven { url https://dl.bintray.com/jetbrains/kotlin-native-dependencies } } dependencies { classpath org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-native-gradle-plugin:+ } } this to the build.gradle . it works in the source-samples because we have the root build.gradle which has already the repositories defined. the next point, which i can't help me. after running i got: > cp: /users/$user/developer/kotlinnative/kotlin-native-0.4/samples/uikit/build/konan/bin/app.kexe: no such file or directory i found out, that the app.kexe exist. but in > cp: /users/$user/developer/kotlinnative/kotlin-native-0.4/samples/uikit/build/konan/bin/iphone/app.kexe: no such file or directory not the iphone here ðŸ™ƒ how can i solve that issue?
