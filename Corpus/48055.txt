 URL : "https://github.com/takahirox/aframe-outline/issues/5" TITLE : registry review 0.4.0 BODY : - can the description in github + package.json + readme be more specific? like outline post-processing effect component for a-frame. - is it possible to support the remove method? if i remove the outline attribute, can we remove the effect? - i don't think we need to handle the play method. .play gets called after update, and there's no need to do anything on scene resume. https://github.com/takahirox/aframe-outline/blob/master/index.js l27 - can we crop the browser chrome out of the screenshot? - readme mentions aframe-deferred-renderer - add a small note in the readme to attach the component to the scene element in how to use
