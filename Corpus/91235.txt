 URL : "https://github.com/certbot/website/issues/198" TITLE : tell people about our ppa BODY : we have an official ppa for ubuntu 14.04, 16.04, and 16.10 that people should prefer over the ubuntu packages and certbot-auto . we should update our instruction generator to tell them about it. @swartzcr, i think this is pretty important. new packages provide a much better experience to our users and let's encrypt has had to do extra work to provide backwards compatibility to the old packages to ubuntu. can you help with this?
