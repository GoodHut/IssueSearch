 URL : "https://github.com/yoavaviram/python-amazon-simple-product-api/issues/112" TITLE : adding to cart BODY : the code for adding items to the cart raises an error if there are more than qty10 added. is there a reason for this? a popular way to read inventory levels of listings is to add qty999 to the cart, which amazon lowers to the actual amount on hand. i am just wondering the reason for the limit of 10. thanks, jason
