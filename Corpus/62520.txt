 URL : "https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx/issues/870" TITLE : computed doesn't cache? BODY : i'm confused about the computed behavior i'm seeing in this basic repro: https://jsfiddle.net/t9t7ycch/ it looks like the computed expression is reevaluated three times, but i thought @computed cached the value and didn't rerun it unless someone observable in the expression changed? obviously nothing is observable here, but it doesn't seem to make a difference. actual output: bash computing... 5 computing... 5 computing... 5 expected output: bash computing... 5 5 5
