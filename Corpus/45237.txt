 URL : "https://github.com/julian-klode/dns66/issues/155" TITLE : host files disappear? BODY : i'm not sure if this issue has been addressed, but i find that after a couple of days, the host files will be deleted and i have to turn off dns66, re-download the host files, and then turn back on dns66. i am on 7.1.2 and am unsure if it's the device or if it is the app that is causing the host files to be deleted.
