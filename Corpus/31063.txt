 URL : "https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/3574" TITLE : revamp build system BODY : prettier build system is not pretty. we support both install from both npm npm i prettier and github npm i prettier/prettier . the structure of the npm production build is: bin/ prettier.js index.js third-party.js parser-babylon.js parser-flow.js parser-....js parsers are packaged separately because they can be expensive to load into the browser or node.js runtime. 3296 also raises that it is non-trivial to load prettier in the browser at all. we use rollup to create the bundles above. there is actually a copy of most of prettier's source code in index.js and bin/prettier.js as they are separate entries without a common package. we should look at a packages approach to creating bundles, and support umd.
