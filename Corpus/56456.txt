 URL : "https://github.com/kantlivelong/OctoPrint-PSUControl/issues/81" TITLE : needs a wiring diagram BODY : i'm sorry if it's obvious, but i'm a newb to connecting hardware to the pi. my pi is powered by a wall wart, independent of the atx power supply. the wall wart has no ground pin. because i have a 12 build plate, i blew out my 29a 12vdc power supply, so i bought a 750w atx power supply, and a small circuit board to run it. i now have plenty of power. the psu has a ground pin, of course. is it safe to just connect pin 40 from the gpio directly to the sense pin on the atx cable? do i also need to interconnect the ground wires of each, or does that risk some kind of unsafe interconnection problem if the two grounds are not at the same potential? if it's a problem, should i be trying to power the pi from the atx power supply? i've read that it is designed to be powered via usb only, and not from the 5v rail on the gpio header. my hope is that a wiring diagram would answer these questions.
