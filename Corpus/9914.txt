 URL : "https://github.com/simonspa/allpix-squared/issues/22" TITLE : add progress bar BODY : in gitlab by @simonspa on may 12, 2017, 14:43 i'd like to have a progress bar floating at the bottom of the shell, which uses full console width, resizes with the window and provides the current progress in processing events. this should be possible e.g. using the ncurses library. normal logging should just go above the progress bar: i r:simpletransfer:telescope4 transferring charges to pixels i r:simpletransfer:telescope4 combining charges at same pixel i r:simpletransfer:telescope5 transferring charges to pixels i r:simpletransfer:telescope5 combining charges at same pixel i r:simpletransfer:cmspixel1 transferring charges to pixels i r:simpletransfer:cmspixel1 combining charges at same pixel w r:simpletransfer:cmspixel1 dispatched message of type message<allpix::pixelcharge> has no receiver
