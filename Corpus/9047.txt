 URL : "https://github.com/MessageOnTap/MessageOnTap_API/issues/5" TITLE : switch to bazel BODY : i think we can switch from gradle to bazel for faster incremental build speed, better project structure as well as more convenient ci & test. one other benefit of using bazel is that it does not run on windows so we can finally ask mingquan to change his os. just kidding... but still... i think we would probably wait for bazel team to fix https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/1372 so that we can still publish to our artifactory server in order that projects relying on this api have no problem using gradle instead of bazel. or, maybe we could write a script to generate the pom file and publish maven artifacts? but that's probably gonna be kind of patchy.
