 URL : "https://github.com/tumblr/TMTumblrSDK/issues/123" TITLE : no oauth for ios? BODY : it's no mentioned in the readme file in this github page, but i read it here http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/tmtumblrsdk/4.0.4/ that apple rejects apps that use three-legged oauth via safari oauth on ios. is it still true? i've it integrated to my app but i haven't submitted it to apple yet . if so, do you plan to release a more native solution for tumblr integration on ios? xauth/embedded webpage are not very ideal solutions either.
