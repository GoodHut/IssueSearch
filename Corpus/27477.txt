 URL : "https://github.com/WorldOfZero/Unity-Shell/issues/1" TITLE : define shell syntax BODY : considerations: - how will multiple values be passed? - how will data be moved from one command to another? pipes? nested functions? - multi-frame commands? how will they work, are they different then normal ones? - what type will passed information have? strongly typed or weakly typed using string interpolation in each command? - in line immediate values? ex: 1 + 1 . is this supported? - understanding types? if strongly typed language, how will types be parsed? how can this be extended later? - how will name conflicts be handled? ex: two commands named the same thing. - how will users create new commands? how will they import them into the shell? - named parameters or not? optional naming? stretch consideration: package extension? how will premade commands be imported for use from 3rd party sources? will this be supported? package manager?
