 URL : "https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/issues/367" TITLE : npm i fails with lerna BODY : i have a project setup with lerna, i refer to some of my modules from other modules of the same repository. if i create two modules a and b , where a depends on b, and i try to run semantic-release, it will fail because it can't find b . it fails because npm i looks into the registry instead of looking in the lerna repo. if npm i could be replaced with a custom command in my case lerna bootstrap , this problem would be fixed. are you okay with a pr to introduce a custom npm i command?
