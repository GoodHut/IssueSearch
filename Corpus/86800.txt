 URL : "https://github.com/liqd/tempelhof/issues/60" TITLE : improve accordion styling BODY : this: https://tempelhofer-feld.berlin.de/material/ looks a bit messy. i think a little more space everywhere would be nice to the eye. below each list item, below each accordion and padding inside of accordions. and maybe a little more space to the right, so the heading doesn't reach almost into the arrow.
