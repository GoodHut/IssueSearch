 URL : "https://github.com/gmemstr/pogo/issues/6" TITLE : fully test docker image BODY : i currently natively develop in windows 10 and don't want to go through the hassle of managing and testing docker with each new build, i will be working on a script for travisci if possible but i want some help putting together some docs and fully testing the dockerfile. basically - test to ensure the dockerfile builds and properly runs pogo - write up steps to fetch docker image and running it i'm fairly new to docker so this will be a learning experience for me as well ðŸ˜‹
