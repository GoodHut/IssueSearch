BODY : i have a doubt, which is how does the model train using train.py ? because in line 123 in train.py https://github.com/experiencor/basic-yolo-keras/blob/master/train.py l123 , while calling yolo.train, the labels aren't passed at all to the fitgenerator. also in https://github.com/experiencor/basic-yolo-keras/blob/master/frontend.py l404 , while making batchgenerator objects to be passed to model.fit_generator do not accept train and valid labels although in the documentattion of model.fit_generator it is stated that: generator: a generator. the output of the generator must be either a tuple inputs, targets a tuple inputs, targets, sample_weights . all arrays should contain the same number of samples. i am a newbie in this field, so i thought that maybe posting this doubt of mine as issue would be resolved. thanks.
