 URL : "https://github.com/stackcss/sheetify/issues/114" TITLE : lower specificity use case BODY : been using sheetify recently and really liking it! was thinking it would be really nice to be able to support a use case that allows for lower specificity selectors. basically now you need to do: input :host > .link { color: indigo; } output ._39jen2 > .link { color: indigo;} what i'd like to do is: input :host-link { color: indigo; } output ._39jen2-link { color: indigo; } thoughts?
