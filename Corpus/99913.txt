 URL : "https://github.com/SWS-Methodology/faoswsTrade/issues/107" TITLE : normalizepath on reportdir BODY : it would be nice and useful to have reportdir defined with forward slashes. probably this is something specific only to windows. right now, it is like: > reportdir 1 c:\\users\\mongeau\\appdata\\local\\temp\\rtmp4ojpxc/mongeau/complete_tf_cpc_20170309133916cet if i copy the path, paste it on file explorer and press enter, the directory can't be found because of the double backslashes. to avoid this, normalizepath can be used to define reportdir : > normalizepath reportdir, winslash='/' 1 c:/users/mongeau/appdata/local/temp/rtmp4ojpxc/mongeau/complete_tf_cpc_20170309133916cet
