 URL : "https://github.com/geneontology/go-ontology/issues/13848" TITLE : minor er term issues BODY : hey @ukemi in https://github.com/geneontology/go-ontology/issues/13781, i added the term stan requested, 'smooth endoplasmic reticulum cisterna', and the parallel term he also suggested 'rough endoplasmic reticulum cisterna'. question 1: in the course of figuring out an appropriate is_a parent, i noticed that we have a term for 'smooth endoplasmic reticulum part go:0097425 ', but not a parallel term for rough endoplasmic reticulum part. thus, for the new term for 'rough endoplasmic reticulum cisterna', i have currently given it the is_a parent of 'endoplasmic reticulum part', as you can see here: d9abcdf. do you think it's worth having a term for 'rough endoplasmic reticulum part'? question 2: i also noticed that the term 'smooth endoplasmic reticulum part go:0097425 has two terms under it: 'hypolemmal cisterna' and 'subrhabdomeral cisterna'. it seems like that these should be moved under the new term 'smooth endoplasmic reticulum cisterna' as each is a more specific type of smooth er cisterna. any objections to moving these two terms under this new parent term?
