BODY : i recently install docker for mac and when i run docker login it uses the keychain by default. i would like it to use the .docker/config.json by default. how do i either uninstall the keychain helper, or tell docker login to use the config.json file? why you might ask do i want to do this? i am using minikube and it needs access to our private docker images. i can send minikube the auth key, but only if it is in .docker/config.json
