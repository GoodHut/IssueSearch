 URL : "https://github.com/trakt-for-plex/configuration/issues/32" TITLE : can't connect to server BODY : after oauth with my account and clicking on my server i get the error: only secure servers are supported when browsing over https:// requests so /identity fail without a response either due to net::err_blocked_by_client or net::err_insecure_response my server is publicly accessible with port 32400 open but i also use a reverse proxy with an ssl cert. is there specific settings i need to change to get this to work?
