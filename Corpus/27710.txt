 URL : "https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightGallery/issues/590" TITLE : dynamic mode issues BODY : i modified the codepen by @sachinchoolur to illustrate this issue: http://codepen.io/justnorris/pen/dwzvyp the gist of it is this - if lightgallery is bound to $ document instead of $ e.target or $ this then it won't open the correct index second time around. i get it, it make sense to reuse the instance and the instance is attached to that dom element, however, i'm using lightgallery dynamicel mode to open a full gallery with elements that may have not loaded yet lazy loading . so this doesn't work right now: javascript // first click settings.index = my_find_index_func_that_returns_int ; // settings.index = 4 $ ' gallery' .lightgallery settings // second event click // after gallery is closed and another image in the gallery is clicked settings.index = my_find_index_func_that_returns_int ; // settings.index = 19 $ ' gallery' .lightgallery settings ; // index 4 is opened anyway
