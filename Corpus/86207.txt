 URL : "https://github.com/flibitijibibo/MonoKickstart/issues/3" TITLE : handling ssl certificates BODY : hi, i'm trying to make a game updater/launcher https://github.com/nihlus/launchpad run self-contained on linux as long as libgtk2 and friends are installed on the system . using monokickstart i got it to work - mostly thanks for this project by the way, this is really cool! . the only remaining problem seems to be, that i want the launcher to download stuff via https, so it needs ssl certificates - and apparently mono can't just use the ones already installed on the system, but wants those to be copied/converted into its own directories via cert-sync first which additionally is painful because the cert path that needs to be passed to cert-sync is different on different distros . now having the user do that or asking them to install mono or ca-certificates-mono kinda defies the goal of providing something selfcontained that just works.. do you have any idea on how to handle this with minimal pain? for example, can i maybe somehow make the mono of monokickstart use certificates i provide myself in a subdirectory of the game/updater? then i could put our current ssl certificate the public part of it there and if we need to update it, we could hopefully get the new certificate version to customers in time via the updater - without recompiling it. but i'm open to other solutions as well, of course : thanks in advance! cheers, daniel
