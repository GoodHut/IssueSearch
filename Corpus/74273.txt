 URL : "https://github.com/cfpb/hmda-platform-auth/issues/144" TITLE : enable keycloak auditing BODY : keycloak has pretty rich auditing for both end-user login related events, as well as actions taken by admins. it is disabled by default. let's enable it. we'll start off logging all events. if it is too much, we can tone it down as needed. it's pretty granular as to which events to log and not.
