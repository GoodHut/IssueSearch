 URL : "https://github.com/mgckind/easyaccess/issues/133" TITLE : add healpix map interface BODY : i think the current plan for des is to use the oracle database as the primary repository for healpix maps. in order to facilitate user access to these maps, i think we want to provide a set of upload_map and download_map functions. upload_map : allow a user to upload a healpix map to the desdm database. would automatically take care of explicit pixel specification scheme and converting to nested formatting the standard for desdm healpix maps . would be accessible from the command line and would take the map filename and desired tablename as inputs. everything else could be dealt with under the hood with healpy . it would also be nice for this function to automatically set some of the table description information based on information collected from the uploaded file. download_map : wrapper to download a map into a fits or fits.gz file. would automatically take care of converting to implicit pixel specification, nside specification, and ring/nest conversion. would be accessible from the command line and would take as input the tablename and output filename, with options for ring/nest formatting. most things would be dealt with by healpy under the hood.
