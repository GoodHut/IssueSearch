 URL : "https://github.com/causefx/Organizr/issues/322" TITLE : php server on windows BODY : hey, very new to this nginx/php. followed the instructions given not the advanced install . nginx is working, running as service through nssm. php is running as service also. installed organizr to c:\nginx\html\ the index.php file is under that folder. done the nssm set servicename appnoconsole 1 for the above services. installed redistributable for visual studio 2015 from what i have read in other comments, i need sqlite. i also saw that you could run check.php, however i can't seem to open the file. accessing localhost opens the nginx welcome page. accessing localhost/index.php downloads the index.php file. using chrome inside a virtualbox running win10 creators. any help would be much appreciated. i've used manage-this-node all along, would like to see this in action, but is a bit more complicated ; thanks!
