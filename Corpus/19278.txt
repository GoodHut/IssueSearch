 URL : "https://github.com/gdkchan/SPICA/issues/35" TITLE : 3ds max animations BODY : attempting to import animations to 3ds max - it all looks perfect in spica, but .dae seems to have some very extreme scaling issues link https://i.gyazo.com/3ebd9634a44fe8c593347077f3c210e2.png and .smd seems like it might have a similar issue, and/or possibly an offset in the bone ids that's placing the transforms on the wrong bones.
