 URL : "https://github.com/cognitect/transit-format/issues/37" TITLE : add transit tour BODY : i've heard about transit for quite a long time, but haven't really understood what it is/how it worked. yesterday i watched david nolen's talk on transit at lispnyc, and only there i found https://cognitect.github.io/transit-tour/ , and i found to quite easy to grok, compared to readme, which is written in official tone of course it has to be a full reference . maybe we should add transit-tour in readme/wiki? it would be a goto-reference to share with a colleague, which would with adopting transit.
