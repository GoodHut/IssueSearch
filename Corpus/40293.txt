 URL : "https://github.com/Ben12345rocks/VotingPlugin/issues/252" TITLE : total rewards given? BODY : i've been voting and have setup the reward files so i should be getting money and diamonds for now but all i see is the thank you for voting and the gui open up acknowledging i voted. if i use the /vote reward i can see the options to view/change the reward details and they show what i added to the files. what i'm trying to find out is, what is the total points, money, items i received and what i was rewarded so i can validate a rewards are working, b i can tally up who got what and players can see what they've earned by voting. thanks, steve
