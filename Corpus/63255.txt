 URL : "https://github.com/coreos/jetcd/issues/146" TITLE : discuss core api naming BODY : hi, the current client interface is in fact a facade to create clients for etcd functionalities so i'm wondering if it could make sense to: - rename client to etcd or jetcd - add client suffix to the client so we match the getter names get client something like: java etcd etcd = etcd.builder .build ; kvclient kvclient = etcd.getkvclient ; a similar naming can be found in orbitz's consul client https://github.com/orbitzworldwide/consul-client
