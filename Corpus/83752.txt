 URL : "https://github.com/arimorty/floatingsearchview/issues/175" TITLE : clearquery is not working BODY : i am having some trouble in automatically clearing the search view query text once the user searches the query. i tried clearquery and even manually tried using setsearchtext at both onfocuscleared and onsearchaction but the search view doesn't clear the text unless it is focussed again. any way of achieving this along with making the search view stay focussed and prevent the keyboard from closing so the user can continue inputing multiple search queries?
