 URL : "https://github.com/laradock/laradock/issues/838" TITLE : php mysqli failed BODY : hi, i'm trying to move from homestead to laradock for local dev, and i'm trying to get a wordpress project running. i use the plugin duplicator to migrate/backup wordpress sites but when trying to clone this site in laradock it says php mysqli extension is not installed. i've gone into the .env and set php_fpm_install_mysqli to true , but it's still showing as not installed. i've tried destroying and rebuilding the containers, switching to php 5.6, and doing a fresh install of laradock. any idea what i might be doing wrong to get this extension working? i'm using docker for windows native on win 10 and bringing things up with 'docker-compose up -d nginx mariadb any pointers or advice would be greatly appreciated. thanks in advance!
