 URL : "https://github.com/tajo/react-portal/issues/143" TITLE : esc key closes all modals BODY : we're using this for modal dialogs and sometimes need to do modals off of modals mea culpa . problem: when the 2nd modal is open and you type esc, both modals are closed. i've tried changing handlekeydown in build/portal.js to stop propagation, but nothing has worked : - key: 'handlekeydown', value: function handlekeydown e { if e.keycode === keycodes.escape && this.state.active { e.preventdefault ; e.stoppropagation ; this.closeportal ; return false; } }
