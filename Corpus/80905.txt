 URL : "https://github.com/keithamus/object-freeze-seal-syntax/issues/6" TITLE : use syntax at root only? BODY : your example: js const foo = { a: { b: { c: { d: { e: some string! } } } } } the syntax looks a bit tedious to write and read to me. i'm just wondering why the freezing or the sealing is not recursive. my proposal: js const foo = { a: { b: { c: { d: { e: some string! } } } } } or js const foo = {| a: { b: { c: { d: { e: some string! } } } } |} which would behaves the same. to me it's not a regular js object anymore, it's an immutable record. what do you think?
