 URL : "https://github.com/oguzhaninan/Stacer/issues/145" TITLE : some issues on 1.0.8.2 BODY : i installed stacer from aur 1.0.8.2 version. awesome it's no longer on electron and memory usage is low. system: manjaro, kernel 4.12, plasma. however, i discovered some bugs: 1 dashboard is not responsive: system info is not fully shown, i need to scroll down. i wanted to resize window to make all info visible but it doesn't work. graphics and all gui interface was just distorted in proportions but the same amount of ui was presented after resize. 2 system startup apps - just doesn't work correctly system shows turned on startups as inactive... activating them does nothing, with next stacer start, they're just show inactive again. in system settings startups are always shown active. when i modified some startup app, it added copy of the one i already had. so i removed the old one and left the new one and this is showed turned on correctly. this is just a mess. 3 system services it's not a bug per se, just it would be nice to have tooltips on cursor hover, so we would know what those columns really are. now i just must assume that first one is startup, second is active. 4 processes - doesn't work at all, list is empty, nothing is searched. a nice piece of software and that is why i wanted to give some feedback.
