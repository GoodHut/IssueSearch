 URL : "https://github.com/rogerthat-platform/rogerthat-android-client/issues/279" TITLE : improve image compression BODY : if my camera takes a 4000x3000 picture, but a max of 2mb is set, it will still be a 4000x3000 picture but it will look terrible because of excessive compression. either add a 'maxresolution' property to the photo widget, or automatically reduce the resolution to improve image quality.
