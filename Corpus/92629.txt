 URL : "https://github.com/casacore/casacore/issues/607" TITLE : 'magic value' aipsio error BODY : i got the following error while ndppp was attempting to write a ms: 868 terminate called after throwing an instance of 'casa::aipserror' 869 what : aipsio::getnexttype: no magic value found i've never seen this before - what is a 'magic value'? the files that threw this error may have been in the middle of being written when my system shut down unexpectedly - is this error an indication that the ms is corrupted somehow? is there any way to isolate which table has an issue, or is the whole file bad now? does it mean something else entirely?
