 URL : "https://github.com/07th-mod/tatarigoroshi/issues/46" TITLE : too long announcer lines BODY : since the auto-mode is finally usable with voices i was careful to properly fix cases where 1 voice line was split to 2 text lines. because the text was stuck on the first line and the second line only showed when the voice was finished. i fixed all of these cases i could find in tatarigoroshi. the only problem is the lines by announcer in tata_014. the problem is that these lines are really really long and the text does not fit on one screen in adv-mode. i can think of 3 possible ways to fix this: 1. decrease the font-size so that the text fits this is what i did but i don't really like it . 2. split the long voice lines to 2 or more so that we can split the text as well. not sure if this would work, some of the sentences are really long 3. force nvl-mode for that part of the game. what do you think? to understand the problem it's actually best to try tata_014 by yourself in the game and pay attention to the lines by announcer. you'll see what i mean.
