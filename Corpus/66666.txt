BODY : i was writing a linear neuron model. the membrane potential increases over time v = 0.1 t, where t is time, and neuron's threshold is 0.3. following is my code i plot the result. v does increase as a linear function of t, but neuron cannot be reset. v continues incresing even if v is greater than threshold. i check spike monitor and find that neuron keeps firing after t = 30, it seems that neuron cannot be reset after fire. did i make something wrong? thank you! from brian2 import prefs.codegen.target = numpy start_scope tau = 10 ms eqs = '''v = t 0.1/tau : 1''' g = neurongroup 1, eqs, threshold='v > 0.3', reset = 'v = 0', method='linear' m = statemonitor g, 'v', record=0 spikemon = spikemonitor g run 50 ms plot m.t/ms, m.v 0 xlabel 'time ms ' ylabel 'v' ;
