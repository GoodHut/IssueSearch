 URL : "https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard/issues/474" TITLE : mods_oneshot key reapeting BODY : when type a key with oneshot modifier quickly, release of the key is ignored and it is repeated. it seems quick successive key reports are overflowed from endpoint banks in lufa protocol. using double endpoint bank or longer wait in keyboard_send cures this problem. but reports should be buffered in keyboard_send without blocking execution. problem: when hold oneshot shift and type 'r' key within tapping_term , you get 'rrrrrr.....'.
