 URL : "https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby/issues/1153" TITLE : 1.8 upgrade doc notes BODY : sorry for the brain-dumpy format, i just helped somebody through an experimental migration to the 1.8 format using https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby/blob/c39c352e7e2e68887b02e9e0619d7c7846153b33/guides/schema/class_based_api.md and came out with a list of notes: - if you were using the field block syntax before most of those will now throw nomethoderror e.g. description or resolve and there's no hint anywhere that they need to be converted to kwargs on the field call. - docs still say arguments take null , but it's now required just like inputs - resolution with methods section seems to be missing part of the explanation? at the least, it's in dire need of an example.
