 URL : "https://github.com/python-rope/rope/issues/212" TITLE : propose for enhancement BODY : hey guys! i've found one issue while development of my project: in 1 : s = b' - - coding: utf-8 - - from __future__ import unicode_literals ' in 2 : start = 12 in 3 : s start not in '=:' --------------------------------------------------------------------------- typeerror traceback most recent call last <ipython-input-3-f25611814cc6> in <module> ----> 1 s start not in '=:' typeerror: 'in <string>' requires string as left operand, not int seems like this issue already fixed here: https://github.com/python-rope/rope/blob/master/rope/base/fscommands.py l266 actually, my fix was a little bit different but then i found one real problem in rope: we do mix in code checkings for bytes or str, that's bad, i'd like propose you to add stringsource, bytessource python classes, and refactor all these checkings. i suspect we won't have big issues after such refactor cause most of the code covered by tests. anyway how it's written now -> not so good, so i propose to refactor these checkings for bytes/string, analyze what's better for us i suspect bytes and then tie all code to one style because right now it's magic issues.....
