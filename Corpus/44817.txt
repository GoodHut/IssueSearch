 URL : "https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-client-javascript/issues/542" TITLE : flow type definitions BODY : by default, flow https://flowtype.org/ will ignore the libraries with missing type definitions leaving them untyped. as a result, flow can't give errors if we accidentally mis-use the library nor will it be able to auto-complete the library . it'd be awesome to have type definitions for algoliasearch added to flowtype/flow-typed https://github.com/flowtype/flow-typed . since we are using both flow and algolia for a special project at gitbook, we've added in our repository very basic type definitions for algoliasearch : https://gist.github.com/jpreynat/79628251790c014c349867f63583d927 file-algoliasearch-js
