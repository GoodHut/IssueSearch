 URL : "https://github.com/HighFivesFoundation/native-applications/issues/1" TITLE : native app shell BODY : since we are taking a modular approach, we are going to need an app shell that can be used to orchestrate all of the containers. there are a lot of approaches to this. i'm looking for ideas. one possible approach would be to publish containers as npm's and incorporate the root component from each npm in the main app shell. this will allow us to keep projects separated in separate repositories. one thing that the shell would need to do is allow for some sort of data communication between containers. there is a lot to think about with this, especially if we are going to approach this design with graphql and apollo. if you have any ideas, solutions, or experience with react native app shells please advise.
