 URL : "https://github.com/darold/ora2pg/issues/591" TITLE : security definer clause BODY : hello, i'm using ora2pg latest release 18.2 from pgdg rhel7 repository in the translation of pl/sql i notice that functions are always translated with security definer attribute. also, i did not see any setting related to that attribute in ora2pg.conf i used ora2pg 17.6b release and compare translations. that release did not set security definer. so it seems to be a bug. thank you.
