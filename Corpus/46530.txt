 URL : "https://github.com/atech/postal/issues/343" TITLE : messages failing dkim BODY : dkim/dmarc is setup correctly for our mail and validated using various online testers. some customers are getting messages being caught by dkim failures etc and checking everything they appear fine but very random in their rejection. dkim key is not changing and is the original one issued. maybe this is related to 339? anyone else seen similar results?
