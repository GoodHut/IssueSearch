 URL : "https://github.com/cygri/pubby/issues/37" TITLE : missing index.html ? BODY : hi, i followed the installation instructions and unpackaged the download file into a tomcat8 root on a debian jessie system . when trying to load http://localhost:8080/ i only get http status 404 â€“ not found type status report description the origin server did not find a current representation for the target resource or is not willing to disclose that one exists. apache tomcat/8.5.14 debian i personally have no experience with tomcat at all but all other apps i've looked at are featuring some index.html file. is there any chance that this is simply missing or what am i doing wrong. kind regards, andreas. ps: i'm afraid that would be a user question but i have not found any mailing list or forum to ask pubby questions.
