 URL : "https://github.com/hillam/EasyAVR-Tada68/issues/1" TITLE : column 9 is unresponsive BODY : at the time of writing this, everything seems to work so far except for column 9 8, i, k, m , which is unresponsive. i copied the row and column config from @terrymathews' qmk config.h https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/tada68/config.h l37 : c define matrix_row_pins {d0,d1,f6,f7,d5} define matrix_col_pins {f0,f1,e6,c7,c6,b7,d4,b1,b0,b5,b4,d7,d6,b3,f4} mine https://github.com/hillam/easyavr-tada68/blob/master/boards/tada68.py l80 : python rows= d0, d1, f6, f7, d5 , cols= f0, f1, e6, c7, c6, b7, d4, b1, b0, b5, b4, d7, d6, b3, f4 i've double and triple checked my matrix against the qmk one as well, and i believe i have everything the same. i've wondered if my backlighting configuration i haven't really changed that from the template i started with yet may have something to do with this problem. i'd like to shoutout to @terrymathews and @dhowland in hopes of getting some more knowledgeable eyes on this to help me out.
