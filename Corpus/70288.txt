 URL : "https://github.com/mitaki28/vscode-clang/issues/52" TITLE : using clang diagnostics BODY : i just started using this extension and it has been working wonderfully for auto-completion. however, i am not able to get it to work for any kind of clang diagnostics. all the diagnostic settings are at their default values: // enable diagnostic clang.diagnostic.enable : true, // the delay after which diagnostic starts in millisecond clang.diagnostic.delay : 500, // tolerable size of the clang output for diagnostic clang.diagnostic.maxbuffer : 262144, i've also updated the clang.cflags setting to the following: clang.cflags : -std=c99 , -wall is there anything else i need to do in order to get diagnostics working? thanks!
