 URL : "https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx/issues/68" TITLE : why preserve self loops? BODY : just a question about the build_path function in the simplify.py module. you've written an if statement to identify and preserve the nodes in self loops, but i'm pretty sure the vast majority of self loops in the osm road network represent cul-de-sacs. for most purposes i'd consider these to be the same as endpoints at the very least don't represent real intersections . before i go tinkering with your script to change that for my purposes i was curious what your thinking was here and if perhaps there's something i'm missing. thanks!
