 URL : "https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-changed/issues/68" TITLE : unsure about this plugin BODY : i don't know where else to post this. gulp-changed doesn't work as expected. i have a source directory and a destination directory. i run a task that compiles typescript, using the source dir as the gulp.src. it's being triggered by a watch task that watches the same source dir. my issue is that every time the task runs it executes on all the files, not just the changed files. i'm looking at the docs, and there's something that doesn't make sense to me. why does the changed function need the dest dir as a parameter. why would gulp-changed care at all about the dest? it should be only looking at the source file, and pass through files that have changed since last run. why would it watch the dest dir? maybe this plugin does something totally different than what i'm getting from the description. i would assume it would just keep an eye on your input files, and filter out non-changed ones every time it runs. in that case, it would never need to watch or look at the destination files. please someone enlighten me, super confused.
