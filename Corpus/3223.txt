 URL : "https://github.com/Dunedan/mbp-2016-linux/issues/47" TITLE : mbp 13.2 wifi BODY : https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=193121 c9 > the country code x0 is apparently stored in the device itself. now this country needs to be supported by the firmware we released to linux-firmware and my guess is that it does not. as far as i see this man has fixed several of these issues already, does someone know if resolving these 13.2 wifi issues is on the horizon as well? like is there something that could motivate him to do this or is it a gamble?
