 URL : "https://github.com/Cibiv/IQ-TREE/issues/49" TITLE : negative constraint tree BODY : iker irisarri: i was wondering whether it is possible to conduct a negative constrained tree search in iqtree, similar to using the -g option. by negative constraint i mean the best ml tree that does not contain a given bipartition e.g. best ml where a and b are not monophyletic . if not, do you plan to implement it in the future? see discussion: https://groups.google.com/forum/ !topic/iqtree/8vzdfnktwxk
