 URL : "https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/3284" TITLE : importing implicit values BODY : it is quite common practice for library authors to provide special object with implicit values. in many cases those are just implicit value definitions pointing to original non-implicit value. example: scala.concurrent.executioncontext.global scala.concurrent.executioncontext.implicits.global it would be useful if import statement could also introduce implicit values. example: import implicit scala.concurrent.executioncontext.global this of course would imply certain limitations on import statement because only vals, defs and objects can be imported as implicits.
