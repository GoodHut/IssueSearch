 URL : "https://github.com/heresy/angular2-social-login/issues/17" TITLE : return of data BODY : i have this scenario: app component logged = false; user: any; login provider { this.auth.login provider .subscribe data => { this.logged = true; this.user = data; console.log data ; } ; } app html <button ngif= !logged click = login 'facebook' >login</button> <ul ngif= logged > <li>{{user.name}}</li> </ul> conclusion: after logging in, the button does not disappear and the data is not loaded ... but if i click the button again, the data is loaded and the button disappears the login screen does not appear again . it would be very strange for the user to have to double-click the login button, would anyone have any idea what might be happening?
