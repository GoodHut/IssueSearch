 URL : "https://github.com/davisking/dlib/issues/908" TITLE : dlib model svm training BODY : i read all svm files in examples directory and i'm sure they don't have any straightforward code for training a linear svm on public dlib model as you suggested on stackoverflow. if you could just hint a bit for something then i'll be able to do the rest. i posted here because didn't got any reply at stack.
