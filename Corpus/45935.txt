 URL : "https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk/issues/434" TITLE : issues with syncpeers BODY : in my test, syncpeers didn't work correctly. i did two tests, the one with the peers in config.json, the other one with the -y flag on the rebuild command. config.json: the node didn't manage to sync from the configured peers. it always got a received invalid height from peer: error from these peers, the sync never started -y flag: the node started to sync, but i queried and loaded the blocks from any peer, not the ones i submitted with the -y flag to the rebuild command
