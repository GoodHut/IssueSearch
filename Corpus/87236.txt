 URL : "https://github.com/TrickyGameTools/Ryanna/issues/1" TITLE : jcr based access in linux BODY : due to linux's dependency structure and shit, linux is a bit of an awful beast on this one, so that's why i saved this one for later. if i cannot test this by the time a linux release has to come out, i might as well make linux stick with non-jcr outputs... at least for the time being. requires some extra building, but hey, i've been in worse situations.
