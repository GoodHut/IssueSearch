 URL : "https://github.com/sparkfun/OpenLog/issues/215" TITLE : openlog power consumption BODY : i hooked up an openlog to my pc. 5v supply. nothing connected to pins 1 marked blk and 6 marked grn . it works fine. however the current consumption is weird. after power on in mode 0 : 21.5 ma, lowering momentarily to 6 ma whenever a character is sent to openlog after switching to command mode: 26.2 ma continuous stays like that after a read or disk command after giving ls command: 7 ma after giving echo off command: back to 27 ma echo was off anyway after giving append command: 1.5 ma until first char sent, then 21.5 ma continuous falling to 7 ma as each char sent. there doesn't seem go be a command to find firmware version. i am not using an arduino. is this how it should behave?
