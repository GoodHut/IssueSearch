 URL : "https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-docs/issues/6" TITLE : source code documentation BODY : i've come across this problem when trying to use intersphinx http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/1.5.1/ext/intersphinx.html . the module index http://python-social-auth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py-modindex.html doesn't exist and there is no link from the documentation to the source code. while the use cases in the documentation are useful to get the user going i think it lacks a connection to the code. at least for me i think this is the third issue i open in two weeks and the other two were posted mainly for lack of knowledge on this library a documentation connected to the code would be interesting. even for you @omab , because a better understanding of the library leads to better and more contributions.
