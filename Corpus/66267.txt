 URL : "https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-engine-js/issues/62" TITLE : middleware health check BODY : as an engine-proxy developer, i want apollo-engine-js to return a 200 ok to some specially crafted request to the graphql endpoint, so that i can verify middleware routing before startup. something like x-engine-from: $headersecret ; x-engine-health-check: true ? then on startup the proxy can detect headersecret and fire a test request to verify middleware was installed correctly.
