 URL : "https://github.com/Trixt0r/spriter/issues/38" TITLE : improve the loading time BODY : i am using this library to load my characters dynamically during the game but it takes about 2 seconds to load even if the character was loaded before . i am doing this in the main thread so the game hangs. i know i could load the sprites in another thread but sounds like the loader needs some improvements. i am planning to do this next month. any considerations? thank you for this great library, btw. saved me a lot of time.
