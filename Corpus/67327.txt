 URL : "https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/5405" TITLE : pinned message thoughts BODY : - pinning a message could should? open the pinned message drawer automatically. - pinned messages should perhaps show the date/time of sending - pinned message drawer openness should persist moving between rooms - how? per-user setting? per-user-per-room? per-room? - since pinned messages exist in a drawer very like a widget drawer, should they be a widget i think _probably_ not, just raising here for consideration ?
