 URL : "https://github.com/zeffy/wufuc/issues/58" TITLE : mcupdate getting disabled BODY : the main reason i use windows 7 is because of windows media center. i notice the latest release of this patch disables the mcupdate_scheduled task on restart. this stops mc from getting guide updates automatically. a few other mc tasks are affected but this one causes the most problems. i now enable the task manually after restarts. can this behavior be changed? atm ms doesn't cripple mc on kaby lake systems.
