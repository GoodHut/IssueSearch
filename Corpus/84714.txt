 URL : "https://github.com/javiereguiluz/EasyAdminBundle/issues/1714" TITLE : display file in list/show BODY : hey @javiereguiluz i just discover that we can't use a special type file or other name in the list and show settings. according to the doc we've to specify our own template to display a simple href template: 'contract.html.twig' : twig <a href= {{ value }} >view contract pdf </a> counter to the special image type with the base_path option which displays a simple image. why don't creating a special file type, also with the base_path who simply displays: twig <a href= {{ asset value }} >{{ value }}</a> or simply adapt the special type url to accept base_path option cause it's nearly the expected result! is there a reason? or i miss something? i know it's not complicated to implement with a template, but for such a simply feature, i just don't understand why it's not packaged in the bundle ; cheers and keep the good work!
