 URL : "https://github.com/corna/me_cleaner/issues/72" TITLE : create v1.1 release? BODY : hi, i'd like to add an ebuild for me_cleaner to my 64-bit gentoo rpi3 overlay https://github.com/sakaki-/rpi3-overlay - would it be possible to create a v1.1 release of me_cleaner please? i can setup the ebuild to clone a particular commit, but it is better to use github's release tarballs where possible clients don't require git installed that way . thanks!
