 URL : "https://github.com/Pixplicity/MultiViewPager/issues/25" TITLE : cannot compile the project BODY : if you clone and open the project with android studio 3 you get this error message: error:unsupported method: baseconfig.getapplicationidsuffix . the version of gradle you connect to does not support that method. to resolve the problem you can change/upgrade the target version of gradle you connect to. alternatively, you can ignore this exception and read other information from the model. i tried modifying classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:1.1.3' to classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.0.0' but i get another error error:the android command is no longer included in the sdk. any references to it e.g. by third-party plugins should be removed.
