 URL : "https://github.com/koreader/koreader/issues/2684" TITLE : a better help BODY : koreader version: 894 device: independent issue i was shocked when i opened help function for the first time just now. i would suggest we can use a pdf file one per language or one with major languages to describe the basic operations of koreader. once the koreader is first started, we can display the pdf instead of opening the file manager. or at least try to show the help file at the top of file manager by controlling the initial folder and default sorting order. i also suggest to allow the user to select the preferred language during the first start. steps to reproduce
