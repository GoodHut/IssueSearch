BODY : i was looking at the emulator/common/makefile.include and it turns out that the code for building the tracer is commented out. additionally, it looks like tracer.cpp includes emulator.h which i couldn't find in the source code. would you please let me know how i can build the tracer so that i can get the trace information in the outputs?
