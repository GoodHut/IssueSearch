 URL : "https://github.com/ModernTLD/cesium/issues/11" TITLE : support for multiple tlds BODY : the configuration option should allow you to specify a list of tlds the program will accept. for example in config.json , a list like this would be great. { tlds : tld , o , free } and et ceteta. they would be the acceptable top-level domains for registrations and domains would go in the correct zones accordingly during registration . this would also make it better if some other operator were to use cesium, as our domains wouldn't be hard-coded in.
