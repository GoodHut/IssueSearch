 URL : "https://github.com/Princeton-CDH/derrida-django/issues/70" TITLE : intervention anchor text BODY : as an intervention data editor, i want to transcribe the anchor text if there is any for an annotation so i can document the text the intervener is referencing. as with other fields, this should be optional. this is the q field in the existing annotator.js data model shouldn't require any extra data handling in the intervention model . i think it's probably already editable in the admin form, but we should confirm.
