 URL : "https://github.com/querydsl/querydsl/issues/2220" TITLE : uuid primary key mapping BODY : hello, i am experimenting with using querydsl on a postgresql database that uses time-based uuids for primary keys. the problem i am having is that the generated classes from querydsl are mapping the uuid columns to simplepath<byte > . this means it is not possible to or at least i haven't figured out how to order query results in ascending order based on the time-based uuid key. it seems like mapping the uuid columns to something like comparablepath<uuid> would be more appropriate. i am new to querydsl, so please accept my apologies if uuid support/custom mapping is described somewhere, however i could not figure out how to change the mapping of the uuid primary key columns. thanks.
