 URL : "https://github.com/radiant-rstats/radiant/issues/25" TITLE : menus not showing up BODY : good evening, i've uninstalled and re-installed r, rstudio, and radiant together and separately several times, but i think i must have failed to delete something that's causing me trouble. when i launch radiant, all appears well until i move off the data-manage tab. view shows only the top portion of the side menu, screenshot pasted below. there's nothing else on the page, except the output to file button which generates a csv with all of the data i can't see or manipulate . can you tell me where to look for possible trouble making files? thank you. windows 10, r 3.4.1, rstudio 1.0.153, ! scrnsht https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14957896/29391152-1fa0e4ae-82c3-11e7-8e9b-c39585d59d0c.jpg
