 URL : "https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/issues/448" TITLE : semantics of dependencies BODY : _this issue was originally opened by @spy-tech as hashicorp/terraform 10936. it was migrated here as part of the provider split https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/upcoming-provider-changes-in-terraform-0-10/ . the original body of the issue is below._ <hr> in amazon ecs using the service scheduler, there exist no real concept of dependencies between services; i would like to deploy one service before another with the guarantee that resource allocation as done by the ecs scheduler is also done in that order. such semantics can exist across different schedulers from different vendors in the future. can terraform mean anything in this case? i have the impression that due to the weak semantics of the depends_on construct this is not possible. i wouldn't be surprised if you don't want to change the current semantics of depends_on , but would you be interested in this more complicated concept of dependency?
