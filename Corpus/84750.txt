 URL : "https://github.com/richardtallent/vue-simple-calendar/issues/25" TITLE : do you need ie11 support? BODY : in planning future revisions, i'm considering dropping official ie11 support for the following reasons: - it has a very small user base now--mostly within corporate it environments that likely aren't progressive enough to be using vue anyway. - my own way of testing ie11 will be disappearing soon, and i'm not eager to set up special systems to do so. - ie11 does not support css variables, and using variables would streamline our styling. we could use sass, but i usually prefer native functionality where possible. - ie11 flexbox support is buggy and outdated. so, for anyone using this component, what's your situation around the need for ie11 support? ! https://api.gh-polls.com/poll/01c04cwhq6tspxqb3j7nqp9q1x/i%20need%20ie11%20support%20for%20the%20foreseeable%20future https://api.gh-polls.com/poll/01c04cwhq6tspxqb3j7nqp9q1x/i%20need%20ie11%20support%20for%20the%20foreseeable%20future/vote ! https://api.gh-polls.com/poll/01c04cwhq6tspxqb3j7nqp9q1x/i%20need%20ie11%20support%20for%20the%20next%206%20months https://api.gh-polls.com/poll/01c04cwhq6tspxqb3j7nqp9q1x/i%20need%20ie11%20support%20for%20the%20next%206%20months/vote ! https://api.gh-polls.com/poll/01c04cwhq6tspxqb3j7nqp9q1x/i%20don't%20need%20ie11%20support%2c%20new%20standards%20ftw! https://api.gh-polls.com/poll/01c04cwhq6tspxqb3j7nqp9q1x/i%20don't%20need%20ie11%20support%2c%20new%20standards%20ftw!/vote
