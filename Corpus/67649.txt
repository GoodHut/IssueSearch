 URL : "https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/issues/534" TITLE : proposal withstyles hoc BODY : ðŸ‘‹ hi there. amazing work on this library! i have a small proposal and was curious what people thought about this idea. in our codebase we like to colocate our component files but at the same time try to keep separation of concerns. the directory structure of a component might look like this: /mycomponent |-- index.js |-- styles.js |-- mapprops.js -- connect.js in our react native projects we simply import the stylesheet from styles.js and then apply all hocs using compose compose connect, mapprops mycomponent . this allows us to make dumb components markup and then implement logic in connect.js redux and mapprops.js useful for mapping props to values relevant to the user . in a css modules project styles.js might simply become styles.css . for styled-components , though, we want to keep using styles.js . this is the hoc we export: es6 import styled from 'styled-components'; // anonymous withstyles export default component => styled component button { color: tomato; } which we can later use like this: es6 export default compose connect, mapprops, withstyles mybutton ; to avoid having to write component => styled component every single time we abstracted this into a withstyles function that is as simple as this basically just a parameter reversal : es6 const withstyles = ...args => component => styled component ...args ; and can then be used like this: es6 export default withstyles button { color: tomato; } my proposal is to add withstyles to styled-components . this would be a very small non-breaking addition to the public api. thoughts?
