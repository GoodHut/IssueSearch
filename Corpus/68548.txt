 URL : "https://github.com/gkapfham/www/issues/17" TITLE : schedule image extended BODY : the image used on this page is 640 x 398 pixels, however the area dedicated to this image is 945 x 430 pixels. this makes it so that if a person clicks on the right side of the image, but not on the image itself, it links to the source. while not critical, this bug could be quite annoying if a person accidentally clicks on that area and then has to return back to your website. so you just have to go back into the source code and change the dimensions of that area to the size of the image source link: http://www.cs.allegheny.edu/sites/gkapfham/schedule/
