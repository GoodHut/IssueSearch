 URL : "https://github.com/BlackSourceLabs/BlackNectar-Service/issues/37" TITLE : refactor match algorithm BODY : right now the algorithm that matches an ebt store with a google place is really well fortified in the code. it should be extracted into its own interface using the strategypattern approach. java interface storematchalgorithm<place> { boolean matchesplace store store, place place ; } this approach will not only make things easier to test, it will also make it easier to improve these algorithms over time.
