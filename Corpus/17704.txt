 URL : "https://github.com/helpscout/seed-barista/issues/17" TITLE : refactor with es6 BODY : although barista works fine, it would be great to refactor the code, especially with es6 things. barista started off with very little features, which rule.js originally parser.js was able to take care of. overtime, as new methods/features got added like mounted tests and media queries , the code became increasingly… spaghetti-ish. i feel like we can do better : . have methods be smaller… possible have util methods as well. use an es6 class instead of .prototype all that good stuff.
