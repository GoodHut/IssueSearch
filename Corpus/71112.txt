BODY : just saw the blog post on this https://theawl.com/every-color-of-cardigan-mister-rogers-wore-from-1979-2001-83c1faba2677 and thought an r color pallete would be a nice idea. are you ok with that? if so, may i use some of your code for scraping the colors? i'd be happy to add you as a contributor. and thanks for making the code available!
