 URL : "https://github.com/LLNL/spack/issues/3072" TITLE : cannot build mpc on comet BODY : when i try to build mpc on comet, then this fails because it tries to use a system-installed mpfr instead of the one that spack just installed. spack should pass the respective configure option to point mpc to its mpfr . this used to work. i assume this is a fall-out from the recent conversion to autotoolspackage that removed the respective configure options.
