 URL : "https://github.com/thejipsess/Drug_Disease_Target_Mapping/issues/1" TITLE : missing drug targets BODY : the drug targets are missing from the graph which is becaused they are not added to the javascript object. in the jsoncreate function they should be added to 'd3data', however for some reason this does not happen. some console logs are present for debugging purposes to check whether they arrayofdrugtargetsmapped does not consists of nulls, meaning they wouldn't be written to d3data. however, this does not seem to be the case so the issue is probably somewhere else.
