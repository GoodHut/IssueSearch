 URL : "https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs/issues/557" TITLE : ohai docs overlap BODY : the ohai page is massive and provides way more information than is actually useful. most of it is focused around writing ohai plugins, which actually duplicates the ohai plugins page. we should remove all the content in the main ohai page and make sure the writing ohai plugins doc is solid.. https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs/blob/master/chef_master/source/ohai.rst vs. https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs/blob/master/chef_master/source/ohai_custom.rst
