 URL : "https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/issues/7067" TITLE : it's all about categories BODY : qbittorrent version and operating system: 3.3.13 windows what is the problem: not a problem, but an improvement... options/downloads/automatically add torrents from: currently, for each entry, user can set monitored folder and override save location . when dropping a file into a monitored location, a category can be set manually - can this be automatic? what is the expected behavior: it would be useful if a category could be selected per entry. a third column would be added called category , this would allow to set any of the existing categories to items that are dropped into the respective monitored folder automatically. p.s. is there a way to delete/remove a category item, my list of categories is getting long and some are no longer needed.
