 URL : "https://github.com/adamvoss/vscode-yaml/issues/5" TITLE : auto-completion by context BODY : would it be possible to have auto-completion based on the yaml context. for example, if i'm typing a key in an associative array, it would complete based on other keys, if i'm typing a value, other values, etc?
