 URL : "https://github.com/kentcdodds/prettier-eslint-atom/issues/28" TITLE : refactoring and repo talk BODY : i just had to refactor the whole codebase over at prettier-atom. i was getting user requirements and prs that ended up putting conditionals everywhere. would you be interested in me porting some of that over here? also, i'm thinking about making that repo extremely similar to this repo. but, i don't know, maybe it would make sense to go all of the way and just merge the two? and allow the eslint integration to be optional somehow via the user's atom settings? that would help maintainability a lot and that way we could share updates. for example, prettier-atom now can run on embedded scopes on save like if you have a script tag in your html file , which we'd otherwise have to sort of copy-and-paste over here. also, i really want to implement jest testing snapshots because manual testing of the rapidly increasing configuration options and stories is becoming a nightmare.
