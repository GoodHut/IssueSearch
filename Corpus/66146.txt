BODY : i figured out whats wrong with enemy ai -- there are no starting locations for them. sc2 requires you place a starting location before you can start campaign ai from triggers. the missing locations is just one more drop in a cup full of crud for how much messed terrain is. problems i found with is so far: 1 pathing is drawn manually over chasms and unreachable high ground instead of using dynamic blockers. 2 instead of setting actor los-pathing footprints in data, doodads have their footprints completely disabled and manual drawn on top. 3 certain doodads historically have no pathing cos they are removed in different campaigns but sc2 doesnt allow removal of footprint, so either use unit or disable it -- but cos of manual pathing it doesn't work and u get stuck on seemingly empty ground. 4 there are multiple locations that make enemies permastuck, despite basic testing with a primitive trigger would reveal them in 15 minutes. 5 there are leftovers of unused pathing on terrain.
