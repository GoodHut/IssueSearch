 URL : "https://github.com/tinyMediaManager/tinyMediaManager/issues/205" TITLE : usetmdb and movie titles BODY : __what tmm version are you using?__ 2.9.4 __release, pre-release, nightly, or directly from github/branch?__ release __what is the actual behaviour?__ scraping movies from imdb without a translated title will net you the original title/transliteration from there. this is despite having usetmdb active. in the past this worked perfectly, now everything foreign and unpopular does not grab translations. haven't been running the software in a while so i'm not sure when this changed. ex: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1640144/ imdb main = le masque de la méduse tmdb original = le masque de la méduse tmdb translation = the mask of medusa __what is the expected behaviour?__ either a fallback to use tmdbs translated title or both info from there with usetmdb . __steps to reproduce:__ scrape any movie.
