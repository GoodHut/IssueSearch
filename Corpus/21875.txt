 URL : "https://github.com/LightsHope/server/issues/611" TITLE : herb respawn rates BODY : hello i am some random mass herb farmer and these spawn rates are awful currently. ever since a herb fix was done near the end of elysium, all herbs or at least the important ones dreamfoil, silverware, etc . had their respawn rates significantly reduced. this is on the light ringer server. you can see this in the over 100% increase in ah value of the herbs. black lotus is fine and working well. the others since they are in a separate pool or w/e you call it are not working fine. lotus has a shorter respawn than any other herb in the game currently. the rates of spawning are very close to the original blizzlike rates which sucks with the population. hope you increase them again! your friend, neenjaaaa
