BODY : hi @kai-xie thank you for great work and share. i would like to use your work for detection network using resnet architecture. since it consists of conv-bn-scale layers only no innerproduct layer . 1. after network pretraining, i have to run pruning for conv layer with itr_size = max_itr 2. what about bn and scale layer ? is there is any parameter to take care for it 3. while pruning, do i have to make my base learning rate small or same as normal training ? 4. could you please give me some information about usage of scripts available under compression_scripts/ -anand
