 URL : "https://github.com/mikelucas-dynes/dummy/issues/9" TITLE : app rotation issue BODY : if you start the app while the phone is in a horizontal orientation it will happily start horizontally orientated. if you then rotate it back to vertical it retains the horizontal layout of the screen components, rendering the app unusable obviously you can close it and start it again vertically . if you attempt to rotate the phone back to horizontal you get the 'this orientation is not supported' message. the app is actually reasonably usable, if ugly, in horizontal mode so long as you never rotate back to vertical.
