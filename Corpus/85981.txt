 URL : "https://github.com/lapism/SearchView/issues/251" TITLE : generics for adapter list BODY : the viewholder can only hold a drawable and string which makes sense , but the adapter list should allow for more variables in case they are needed when an item is clicked. for example, if i have a list of person objects, i can display their name in the search results, but require their age & id when a person is selected. this can be done now by saving a list externally and referencing it with indices, but should be doable with generics. i will be working on this when i have time.
