 URL : "https://github.com/cedardevs/onestop/issues/208" TITLE : descriptive text length BODY : the front end interface does not employ usability best practices in several key areas. for example, when an item from a search result is selected, the descriptive text runs most of the way across the page. usability research shows that lines of text should not run to more than about 50-74 characters; in the result item i selected, the first line runs to about 84 characters. there is inadequate paragraphing as well. web text ideally should have paragraphs of roughly 50 words. the text display on the item i selected was an unbroken 300 plus words.
