 URL : "https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/issues/10132" TITLE : multiple maps on android BODY : platform: android mapbox sdk version: 5.1.1 i'm using mapbox together with xamarin.forms. i've added a map to 2 pages. whenever i open one of the pages, everything is fine. but when i open the first page and then navigate to the second page, keeping the first one in the back stack, i see 2 maps in the mapview. it looks like opengl is still rendering the first map too.
