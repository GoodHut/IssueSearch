 URL : "https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler/issues/37" TITLE : public docker image BODY : it might be worth noting in the readme that you can find a publicly accessible docker image for unicycler at quay.io/biocontainers/unicycler. that can be helpful when there's a program with so many dependencies. you can also include a note on running an assembly with the docker image in a single line, e.g.: docker run --rm -v $pwd:/share quay.io/biocontainers/unicycler:0.3.0b--py35_1 /bin/bash -c cd /share; unicycler -1 read1.fastq.gz -2 read2.fastq.gz -l long_reads.fastq.gz -o output_dir
