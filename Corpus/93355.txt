 URL : "https://github.com/WNProject/WNFramework/issues/71" TITLE : add semaphores to graphics BODY : we currently use a fence for everything, but that is overkill in a lot of cases. we need something akin to vksemaphore i.e. device/device synchronization that does not modify the host behavior . this should be reasonably easy to add. just a new type, but should improve performance and prevent blocking as much.
