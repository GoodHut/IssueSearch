 URL : "https://github.com/LLK/scratch-gui/issues/491" TITLE : translation for libraries BODY : expected behavior when you open the sprite/backdrop/costume/sound libraries and your language is set to something other than english, the names of the items should be in the user's language. actual behavior in scratch 2.0 the library categories are translated, but the names of the individual items are not. so this is an enhancement over 2.0. however, we need to design the libraries with translation in mind or it'll never happen.
