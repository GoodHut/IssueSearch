 URL : "https://github.com/lodash/lodash/issues/3442" TITLE : feature request for _get BODY : hi all _get is returning the property path object value. but what if i need the property object itself? i would do like to get the property path object reference instead of the value. can we have a new utiliy feature called i.e. _getref that will return the property path object reference? sometimes we need access to the object reference, not the value. i.e. when we want add knockout observers to it, or on other edges cases, etc.
