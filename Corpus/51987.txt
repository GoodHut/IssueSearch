 URL : "https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-advanced-pagecache/issues/13" TITLE : caching does not work. BODY : not sure if it's just me... changing advanced-pagecache.php l68 https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-advanced-pagecache/blob/develop/advanced-pagecache.php l68 to echo $pagecache.' <!-- from cache -->'; does not change any page at all. further investigation shows that isdefaultpagetype never returns true, because $uri->extension is always 'html'. until i hardcoded $extension == 'html' it just did nothing. i'm sorry if i missed something, middle of the night here.
