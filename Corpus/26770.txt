 URL : "https://github.com/meandmax/lory/issues/544" TITLE : can't change slides BODY : no matter what is clicked, or whether i use the slideto method, slide 0 is always the active slide. i can't reproduce this on the demo page, but i can't make it not do this on my own site. i believe all the markup is correct. the before.lory.slide event fires, but currentslide is always 0, and nextslide is always undefined.
