 URL : "https://github.com/IanTayler/MinG/issues/11" TITLE : getting edmgs from files BODY : i should add an optional line in grammar's headers to specify the type of the grammar. say type=edmg . the default should be type=mg for backwards compatibility. i will probably have to write a separate grammar and converter actions for edmgs and have grammar_from_text do the following: 1. check whether the first line starts with type=\w+ 2. if not, parse the text with your normal ming::from::text grammar. 3. if it does, eliminate that line and parse the rest of the text with the appropriate grammar and converter actions. this should all be done in a way that can be easily extended if i were to one day add another extension/variation of minimalist grammars to the module.
