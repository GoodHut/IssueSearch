 URL : "https://github.com/absinthe-graphql/absinthe_ecto/issues/27" TITLE : fetch single record BODY : lets say an event has many attendees events_users , and we have a unique index so that a user can't attend the same event twice. is there a way using absinthe_ecto to have a field on event called e.g. current_user_attendance which checks if the current user attended the event, but instead of returning a list with a single 'attendance', it returns the field directly? elixir object :event do field :current_user_attendance, list_of :event_user do resolve assoc :events_users, fn query, args, %{current_user: current_user} -> query |> where eu , eu.user_id == ^current_user.id end end end the above works fine, except it'll return the aforementioned list, when we know be definition there will be either one or zero results. i appreciate i could write a custom resolver, but it would be very elegant to do it in absinthe_ecto , as when you're fetching many events it very cleanly takes care of n+1 issues.
