 URL : "https://github.com/lwansbrough/react-native-camera/issues/971" TITLE : requires main queue setup BODY : i'm getting a warning when running react native camera. module rctcameramanager requires main queue setup since it overrides constantstoexport but doesn't implement requiresmainqueuesetup. in a future release react native will default to initializing all native modules on a background thread unless explicitly opted-out of. is this something that will be fixed soon?
