 URL : "https://github.com/aacotroneo/laravel-saml2/issues/90" TITLE : preventing replay attacks BODY : reading the onelogin/php-saml readme, they suggest tracking the message ids to make sure you don't see a repeat. is it possible to get at the message ids using this in order to track them in an application? if not at present, i think the best way would be to pass through the saml2auth object to the event and add a getter in to saml2auth to get the last message id from the onelogin_saml2_auth object. i'm happy to make a pull request with this if you agree.
