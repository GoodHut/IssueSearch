 URL : "https://github.com/NicolasPetton/Indium/issues/70" TITLE : infinite loop protection BODY : i accidentally evaluated the buffer in indium-scratch, which had an infinite loop as written. the repl was stuck printing returned values. after quitting indium -- not sure if this was the right course of action -- i saw a bunch of errors scrolling through the minibuffer, too quickly to read. then emacs froze. again, not sure if there is a better command to run, or if this is really a node.js issue, but it would be nice if there were some way to stop evaluation of the loop.
