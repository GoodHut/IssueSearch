 URL : "https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm/issues/299" TITLE : exwm not filling display BODY : i am trying to get exwm working on guixsd. i've installed: - xhost - xset - xsetroot - gnome-settings-daemon - dbus - xelb - and of course, exwm i then placed the provided xinitrc file in ~/.xsession and made it executable. currently exwm starts and mostly works fine. the problem is that the exwm frame does not take up the entire display. instead, it only takes up the upper left corner. passing --fullscreen to emacs in ~/.xsession makes exwm _look_ like it's going to take up the entire display when starting, but after startup the frame is still the same size as before. i'm convinced this is an exwm issue because my other x window managers work fine, and the mouse can move outside of the exwm frame when running. also, i run exwm in gentoo, where it works fine.
