 URL : "https://github.com/elliotchance/c2go/issues/349" TITLE : debug perfomance: clang BODY : problem now, preprocessor for each run go test -tag=ingeration use clang for build ast tree of c source. preliminary, it is take 50% of time. solution create in /tmp/ specific caches. preliminary steps: 1 create a folder /tmp/clang-ast/ 2 user run c2go transpile ... or go test -tag=ingeration 3 preprocessor create a copy of user c source in temp folder for example : tmp/clang-ast/1 . 4 preprocessor calculate a hash of c source file and saved in folder for example : .../1/hash.txt . 5 preprocessor convert c source to ast tree and saved in forlder for example: .../1/ast.txt . 6 preprocessor saved file about success for example: ...1/done . 7 next work like usually. for next running: preprocessor check have cached ast tree and if hash is same, then used prepared ast tree. +/- if you reboot, then all cached file are lost. and it is ok.
