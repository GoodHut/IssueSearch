 URL : "https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites/issues/10539" TITLE : multiple grids on xy grid BODY : just recently switched from the float grid to the xy grid on 6.4.2 and i struggle to find a way to implement multiple grid semantically as float grid was capable of. it used to be possible through the grid-row function as in this example: .container { @include grid-row 10 { .main-content { @include grid-column 7 ; } .sidebar { @include grid-column 3 ; } } } how am i able to create a new grid-x with a custom number of columns with the new grid system? seems to be also problematic with the flexbox grid, so i'm pretty sure i'm missing the functionality which is somewhere i imagine.
