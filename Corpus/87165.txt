 URL : "https://github.com/SonarSource/docker-sonarqube/issues/129" TITLE : issue using oracle db 12c BODY : hi there, first of all, let me say that i am fairly new to docker and also i have very little knowledge of oracle dbs or databases in general i am trying to use oracle db 12c instead of h2, so i have made a little addition to the dockerfile to download the ojdbc8.jar file from my artifactory instance to the required directory. the below is my addition in the docker file. curl -o /opt/sonarqube/extensions/jdbc-driver/oracle/ojdbc8.jar http:// my repository /artifactory/files-local/ojdbc8.jar and i have also setup an oracle db 12c, and created a user called c sonar, and granted it rights to connect. this is using sqlplus in the oracle db server. create user sql> create user c sonar 2 identified by sonar 3 temporary tablespace temp 4 default tablespace users; user created. grant connection privilege sql> grant connect, resource to c sonar; grant succeeded. this is the command that i use to run the image. docker run -d --name sonarqube -p 9000:9000 -e sonarqube_jdbc_username=c sonar -e sonarqube_jdbc_password=sonar -e sonarqube_jdbc_url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@ my ip address :1521:orclcdb sonarqube the container starts up and runs fine. however, when i browse to sonarqube, it just hangs and eventually times out after a long time waiting. when i use the default h2 database sonarqube is accessible without issues.. can anyone point out what i could be doing wrong here? i suspect that it could be something that i didn't setup in oracle db, and/or something wrong with my docker run command?? thanks!
