 URL : "https://github.com/JakobEngel/dso/issues/55" TITLE : extracting point cloud BODY : hi, i've been trying to extract the final point clound from dso, to later use it in a visualizer meshlab . i looked around publishkeyframes but it only seems to be talking about pointhessians, and not the actual point cloud. the results i get from extracting the content of the buffer in refreshpc doesn't represent the final result either, it may be because i'm not sure how to use the camtoworld projection matrix. has anyone managed to get pass this issue ?
