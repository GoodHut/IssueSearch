 URL : "https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-state-tree/issues/431" TITLE : typesafe model env BODY : i know there has already been a related issue raised and fixed around typesafety in https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-state-tree/issues/250 my question however is related but different. would it be possible to specify on the model the environment that it expects? for example: typescript interface itodoenv { logger: ilogger } const todo = types.model<itodoenv> { title: } .actions self => { settitle newtitle { // grab injected logger and log getenv self .logger.log changed title to: + newtitle self.title = newtitle } } i know that we can currently do getenv<itodoenv> self .logger but because we have manually defined what we expect the environment to contain at the model level 'getenv self .logger' then becomes typesafe throught the entire model without having to retype is each time?
