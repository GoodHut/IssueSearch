 URL : "https://github.com/pmodels/mpich/issues/2514" TITLE : ch4/ucx: hangs in finalize BODY : from the looks of it, collective tests periodically hang during mpi_finalize like so - https://jenkins.mpich.org/view/nightly-master-ch4/job/mpich-master-ch4-ucx/compiler=gnu,jenkins_configure=default,label=ib64/lastcompletedbuild/testreport/ root /summary_junit_xml/52_____coll_allgatherv2_10/. see that no errors is correctly output, meaning all processes have finished verifying the correct result of the test. am-only configurations of ch4/ucx do not appear to have this problem.
