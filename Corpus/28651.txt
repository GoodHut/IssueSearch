 URL : "https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress/issues/183" TITLE : high glbc cpu usage BODY : i noticed in stackdriver monitoring that glbc is using about 30% cpu constantly in my cluster. @thockin said on slack that this might be related to misconfigured gce ingress. however i looked through all my ingresses and they are all class nginx. anyone got a clue or a suggestion as to troubleshoot further? one thing which i noticed is in my ingress kube-lego , which is configured automatically by kube-lego, there is a part status which looks like this: status: loadbalancer: ingress: - ip: 130.211.... - ip: 146.148.... the second ip adress adress is my nginx loadbalancer, however: the first ip adress is unknown to me, i currently do not know where that is from.
