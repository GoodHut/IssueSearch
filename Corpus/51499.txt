 URL : "https://github.com/hyperoslo/Cache/issues/156" TITLE : apple store submission BODY : i have updated cache to version 4.0.3 and since, i can't upload my application anymore to the apple store : i'm using carthage and ios extension. i'm having these following errors : itunes store operation failed error itms-90205: invalid bundle. the bundle at 'application.app/frameworks/cache.framework' contains disallowed nested bundles. itunes store operation failed error itms-90206: invalid bundle. the bundle at 'application.app/frameworks/cache.framework' contains disallowed file 'frameworks'. i tried to play with cache project configuration with no luck. in v3 i had to manually add swifthhash as a dependency. in the latest version the dependency seems to be added automatically. could it be the issue?
