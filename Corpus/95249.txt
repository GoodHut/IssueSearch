 URL : "https://github.com/devopsdays/devopsdays-cli/issues/50" TITLE : create editsponsor command BODY : this allows for the editing of an existing sponsor via edit sponsor command. i'm not sure we want to include this functionality as we don't want people editing. this should probably instead just prompt the user that they should create a new sponsor with a similar name somehow.
