 URL : "https://github.com/NuCivic/react-nvd3/issues/60" TITLE : fix given examples BODY : hello, after installing the module i thought i could use some examples to help me in the beginning. i would be really glad if there were available online, but downloading the project is good enough. however, i have found most of them do not work as they should. below i present you a list of my suggestions and/or problems i have faced: - examples available online ? - or make examples section in readme and describe how to use them ? - npm install does not install peerdependencies . react and react-dom have to be installed manually - barchart: what is click me button supposed to do? graph disappears - cumulativelinechart: only short series is visible - cumulativelinechart: re-scale y-axis does not work - linechart: after clicking change data , tooltip legend is ghosting with old values - multibarchart: grouped or stacked give the same result. add data? - piechart: labels and values are really confusing :smiling_imp:
