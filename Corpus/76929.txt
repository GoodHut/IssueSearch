 URL : "https://github.com/neubaut/tahmo-hub/issues/28" TITLE : medium legacy api update BODY : this is a placeholder for the api v1 update which will be required as a last step before switching to this new system. the api v1 doesn't support all the endpoints yet from the current/old infrastructure which for instance provides aggregated data as well. the current api v1 support is based on the documentation from 2 years ago. in the meanwhile we've made some small adjustments to it and would like have these transferred in here as well.
