 URL : "https://github.com/source-foundry/autofont/issues/4" TITLE : font build types BODY : suggest that we use the following as the initial build artifacts: - unhinted ttf - hinted ttf - woff - woff2 woff and woff2 support is now available broadly across current browsers and my understanding is that it is not necessary to release other web font build types at this stage unless you are targeting old browsers. woff: https://caniuse.com/ feat=woff woff2: https://caniuse.com/ feat=woff2 i think that ultimately there will be a need to support: - unhinted otf - hinted otf as many projects out there will be looking for an approach to build these file types. unhinted otf can be built from ufo with fontmake. this is a simple modification that only requires an adjustment in the output file type flag on the command line. i haven't come up with an approach to get from unhinted otf to hinted otf including some level of granularity in the manual modification of any autohinting process with a floss hinting tool at this stage, so this would require a bit of research work. for hack, this has not been necessary because we are dropping otf build support to focus on ttf files.
