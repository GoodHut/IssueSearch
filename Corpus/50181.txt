 URL : "https://github.com/TeamMoodGitHub/EvanPet-Term-1/issues/1" TITLE : week 1: idea & sprint BODY : idea : evan wants to create a web application with the primary purpose of tracking league statistics and offering such features like a leaderboard, customized stats, and analysis on his data. he has already chosen his tech stack of react / redux / express and his primary goal is to work independently while receiving feedback that his practices are industry standard and he is writing in clear, maintainable, and understandable code. plan : for this week, evan has identified some bugs in his code from the work he has already done and has shared with me the structure of his repository. i am asking him to continue working on the stack he is writing in and to move his code from a private repo to this one to allow me to perform some code reviews on him. additionally, i had a discussion with him on an asynchronous rendering issue he was having and have asked him to examine his code on state setting as react should not be triggering re-renders without having first received new data.
