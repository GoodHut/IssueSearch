 URL : "https://github.com/AlejandroSilvestri/os1/issues/13" TITLE : os1 on windows BODY : i've successfully installed orb-slam2 on windows, but i need to use a fisheye camera, so i want to try this os1 version. do you have any hints on how i can use your code without having to recompile everything ? i guess if it's a linux version, i'll have some compatibility issues. thanks a lot, thibaud
