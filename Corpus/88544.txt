 URL : "https://github.com/SublimeHaskell/SublimeHaskell/issues/335" TITLE : not ffnding hsdev in path BODY : on starting sumblimetext, i get: hsdev executable couldn't be found check if it's installed and in path hsdev will be disabled, enable it by setting 'enable_hsdev' to true i am pretty confident that i have hsdev installed. i used cabal to install it, and i see it in my %appdata%/cabal/packages/hackage.haskell.org folder. all installs were in the default paths, but i did : add_to_path : %appdata%//cabal//bin anyway. i am on windows.
