 URL : "https://github.com/kaczmarj/rteeg/issues/15" TITLE : consider using go for data BODY : consider using the go language to concurrently add to and read from an array. this functionality is currently implemented in base python, which requires threads and locks and is slow. go's goroutine takes care of scheduling, making it easier to parallelize. go also compiles to assembly, so writing to and reading from the data array would be much faster. the idea is that a new data type would be written in go that has methods to write and read data to an array. the write method could be called as a goroutine , and reading could be called as necessary. one issue is how to use labstreaminglayer in go.
