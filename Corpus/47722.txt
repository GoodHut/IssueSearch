 URL : "https://github.com/PhpGt/WebEngine/issues/261" TITLE : profile within docker BODY : when running docker on windows, execution speed is very poor. this is not webengine specific, as all php seems to perform the same, and may be a limitation with docker on windows... but this needs investigating! now that v3 is running simple apps on its own, speed within docker is a priority. start with xdebug and compare on other platforms.
