 URL : "https://github.com/mreferre/rancher-catalog-extension/issues/1" TITLE : docker push times out BODY : tried out your template in rancher. the stack comes up, but i already have a load balancer, so i deleted yours and pointed a subdomain registry. 80:80 to the proxy container. i can use the admin ui, create projects etc... i can even docker login registry.foo . but i can not docker push registry.foo/containername it just sits there timing out.
