 URL : "https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/23676" TITLE : button background colors BODY : i know the isuses section is not supposed to be for questions, but since this beta release is so new i doubt someone from stackoverflow could help on this. with the new bootstrap beta release the button colors have changed i absolutely hate the new colors/theme and i wasn't able to figure out where / how i can change these colors back to the old theme . i have checked the variables and couldn't figure out what value to set to change the hover or btn background color. the documentation doesn't explain anything about buttons either.
