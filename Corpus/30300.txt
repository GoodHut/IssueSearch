 URL : "https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-java/issues/81" TITLE : out of date i think BODY : i think many are calling opentracing version 1 or something and it is here 0.20.7 including methods marked deprecated. if these methods are in fact no longer in the api, they should be removed instead of leading people on. if the api is version 1, then it should probably be marked so.. sound sensible?
