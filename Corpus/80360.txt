 URL : "https://github.com/eslint/eslint.github.io/issues/327" TITLE : too complicated sentence BODY : > eslint resolves a relative path to a base configuration file relative to the configuration file that uses it unless that file is in your home directory or a directory that isnâ€™t an ancestor to the directory in which eslint is installed either locally or globally . in those cases, eslint resolves the relative path to the base file relative to the linted project directory typically the current working directory . this is hard to understrand. the first sentence is very very long to me.
