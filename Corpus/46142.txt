 URL : "https://github.com/wsspg/wsspg-woocommerce-stripe-subscription-payment-gateway/issues/9" TITLE : limit of 10 being hit BODY : on most requests, stripe has a default limit of 10: limit optional a limit on the number of objects to be returned. limit can range between 1 and 100 items, and the default is 10 items. the subscriptions page on the dashboard, the stripe subscriptions in the admin area look to hit this limit. anywhere that this code is being used: $subscriptions=wsspg_api::request 'subscriptions', wsspg::get_api_key 'secret' , null, 'get' ; to make my site work again, i changed ./public_html/wp-content/plugins/wsspg-woocommerce-stripe-subscription-payment-gateway/includes/class-wsspg-api.php as follows: $url = wsspg_plugin_api.$action. ?limit=100 ; this is only a workaround though as when i hit a 100 subscriptions there is going to be the same problem. pagination needs to be put in place to solve this permanently. it would also be nice if customer-specific calls used the customer's id to avoid pulling back all the subscriptions and iterating through them.
