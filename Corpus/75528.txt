 URL : "https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/issues/2663" TITLE : how do i use the icons!? BODY : i'm trying to use the icons v-icons in my basic project. so i go to the icon section in the documentation at https://vuetifyjs.com/components/icons. twirl open the very first example 1 to look at its template. it shows: <v-icon>home</v-icon> . when i put line into my project, i don't see any icons. i thought i need to install the material design icon set even though the documentation does not say so. but i went ahead and installed it npm install material-design-icons . however, their documentation page doesn't say anything about how to use it beyond the npm install stuff. what do i include/import into my project, if anything? i tried import '../node_modules/material-design-icons' but the icons still don't show up. what am i missing in order to use the basic icons that are used in the v-icons documentation section? thanks.
