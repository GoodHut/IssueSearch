 URL : "https://github.com/CodeHubApp/CodeHub/issues/349" TITLE : improve ipad support BODY : when using an ipad with codehub in landscape mode, the “lists” of content are very wide. a little too wide. at the very least the side-menu could be pinned open permanently to facilitate faster navigation. this is a pattern commonly seen in email clients. building on that request, and probably more complex, i’d like to see a more thoughtful usage of all the screen real estate on an ipad. for example, when i tap on a github organization, the sidebar could be a list of all the repos on the left, and on the right would be the details of those repos as i drill down on more details.
