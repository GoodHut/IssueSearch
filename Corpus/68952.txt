 URL : "https://github.com/phetsims/chipper/issues/595" TITLE : sort require statements BODY : @jonathanolson mentioned that he and some other developers sometimes like to alphabetically sort the require statements. i asked on skype and heard 3 yesses right away, this is in addition to @jonathanolson. sublime had built in support for this. idea doesn't have built in support for it though maybe a plugin , but it would be nice if we had a tool for this.
