 URL : "https://github.com/Patashu/break_infinity.js/issues/1" TITLE : add ie6 support BODY : break_infinity.min.js should be able to function correctly on all versions of internet explorer including ie6 , because many people who go to kongregate still use internet explorer. break_infinity.js uses the class keyword, which immediately disqualifies it. to make break_infinity.min.js, i throw break_infinity.js into http://babeljs.io/repl/ set to es2015, then into https://javascript-minifier.com/ , and the code still works in for example chrome. but i don't have a way to test easily in ie due to lack of developer tools. so if you can test and confirm it works ok, or can give me a set of steps that do produce javascript working on ie, let me know.
