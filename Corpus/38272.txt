 URL : "https://github.com/cryogen/throneteki/issues/1273" TITLE : ours is the fury bug BODY : just noticed an issue with ours is the fury. my opponent used it to target a stannis baratheon who was already participating in the challenge as a defender - this is a legal play because he could potentially stand upon winning the challenge - but throneteki counted his str twice when we resolved the challenge because it thought there were two instances of him participating in the challenge.
