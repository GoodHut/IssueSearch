 URL : "https://github.com/CERTCC-Vulnerability-Analysis/certfuzz/issues/13" TITLE : fuzzing strategies syntax BODY : hi, i am trying to understand how to properly define the range_list parameter in order to fuzz only a certain bytes offset of the seedfiles. in the readme is mentioned that the bytes range should be one per line in hex or decimal . range_list: byte ranges to be fuzzed. one range per line, hex or decimal my idea is too instruct bff to fuzz only the first 30kb of each seedfile. therefore should i place something like this in the bff.yaml? fuzzer: fuzzer: bytemut fuzz_zip_container: false range_list: 0x0000 range_list: 0x7530 or should i use min_ratio & max_ratio as mentioned in bytemut.py? which looks like the option, to instruct bff how many bytes fuzz at the same time for each iteration class bytemutfuzzer minimizablefuzzer : ''' this fuzzer module randomly selects bytes in an input file and assigns them random values. the percent of the selected bytes can be tweaked by min_ratio and max_ratio. range_list specifies a range in the file to fuzz. roughly similar to cmiller's 5 lines o' python, except clearly less space efficient.
