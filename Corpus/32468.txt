 URL : "https://github.com/egoist/poi/issues/323" TITLE : use postcss plugins BODY : <!-- please don't delete this template or we'll close your issue --> <!-- before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of poi. --> do you want to request a feature or report a bug ? i'd like to report a bug <!-- issues which contain questions or support requests will be closed. --> what is the current behavior? first, thank you for this project, it's quite a time saver : so, my problem is, i can't use postcss plugins, except for 'autoprefixer' which is already incuded if the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce. here is a link to a gist https://gist.github.com/alx-l/4917e8e50bc744d93f6ee4e363c0dcf4 , so you can have an idea of what's going on. i don't get any errrors, but my css is not affected by the plugin i declared. even if i add 'autoprefixer': postcss: { use: 'autoprefixer' , 'autoprefixer': { browsers: 'last 10 versions' }, append: true }, this won't be taken into account. whereas if i set options using: module.exports = { autoprefixer: { browsers: 'last 10 versions' } } i can see that my css will be updated accordingly. <!-- a great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a github gist. --> <!-- best provide a minimal reproducible repo --> what is the expected behavior? i also made a postcss.config.js file, but i can't manage to get poi to use it... i tried to use it inside webpack loaders: { test: /\.css$/, loader: 'postcss-loader', options: { config: { path: computepath './postcss.config.js' } } } but this is never called. if this is a feature request, what is the motivation or use case for changing the behavior? please mention other relevant information such as the browser version, node.js version, poi version and operating system. i'm using npm 5.5.1, poi 9.6.8 on a macos sierra
