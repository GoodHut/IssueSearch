 URL : "https://github.com/Firemoon777/tgfs/issues/3" TITLE : tgfs is very slow BODY : i have quite a big chat in tg. i've mounted telegram to folder with tgfs . and i've started rsync --verbose -a --progress and for whole night it was only 14 of ~1000 files that was copied! so in that sense tgfs is unusable in that case...
