 URL : "https://github.com/mono/taglib-sharp/issues/69" TITLE : rfc: new tag property BODY : taglibsharp deeply inherits from taglib, which was initially targeting mp3 id3 tags only. this legacy is visible in the choice of properties names/selection available in the base tag class of taglibsharp. actually, with the addition of more tag-formats and especially the support of videos, i have the impression we should precise and extend the set of available tag properties to handle the videos better. of course, these addition should also benefit to the audio counterpart. example: back to the future 2. - redefinitions: the following properties have names from the audio world. how should it map to the videos ?: - album: season, or sequel back to the future - track: episode number, or sequel number 2 - trackcount: number of episodes in the season 3 - additions: these properties are missing to properly support videos: - subtitle: short description, catch line of the viedo/music. - description: description or summary plot after visiting 2015, marty mcfly must repeat his visit to 1955 to prevent disastrous changes to 1985...without interfering with his first trip - performersrole: list of charaters for video, instruments played for music. this should match the performers list for each name correspond one role . - date taged - language: if tag format support multiple language, define the prefer language to be retrieved. any though on that ?
