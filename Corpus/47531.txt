 URL : "https://github.com/ttmarek/consolemock/issues/7" TITLE : please support node 4 BODY : hey, i just cloned consolemock and ran the check on node v4.0.0 and it was successful. do you mind adding support for node 4? we want to use this module in lint-staged for snapshot testing with jest. but we support node 4.2 and above and hence the request. if it is as simple as changing the engines.node field in the package.json and circle.yml , i could make a pr if you'd prefer it.
