 URL : "https://github.com/presidential-innovation-fellows/code-gov-web/issues/261" TITLE : activity out of date BODY : it looks like the data behind the activity section are months out of date, at least going by the first example i looked at: https://code.gov/ /explore-code/repos/28643936. this page shows the latest activity as from november, but https://github.com/18f/analytics.usa.gov has much more recent activity. is this expected?
