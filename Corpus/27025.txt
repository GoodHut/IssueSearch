 URL : "https://github.com/onevcat/Rainbow/issues/15" TITLE : clear string colors BODY : hi, i ❤️ using rainbow in my projects. i am however stumbling across an issue where i need to use the length of a string as in .characters.count or just .count in swift 4. obviously this changes when introducing escape sequences, so i was looking for a way to remove these. rainbow offers the handy .removingcolor method on strings, but unfortunately this seems to just replace the escape sequences with default values. is there a way to access only the actual string content itself? that would be fantastic!
