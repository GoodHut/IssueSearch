 URL : "https://github.com/gogo/protobuf/issues/304" TITLE : create custom plugin BODY : hey there, firstly, thanks for creating and maintaining this awesome project. we are using it in production in nakama https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama . we'd like to create two extensions. i'm quite confused on how to get the compiler to recogniser the extensions, activate them and generate the output. do you have a guide anywhere on how to get started or code samples? fyi - the two plugins are: 1 a plugin that creates a func for each message that contains the message name or a custom string that represents the message name . think of it as equivalent to class.getsimplename in java. 2 a plugin that returns a lua table that contains the structure and data of the proto message. this should be compatible with gopherlua. it would be amazing if you could tell me your thoughts and guide me on where to start. cheers, mo.
