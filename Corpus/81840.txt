 URL : "https://github.com/carpedm20/NTM-tensorflow/issues/28" TITLE : a more efficient approach BODY : hi @carpedm20, your code helped me a lot when i was just starting to understand ntms and i am therefore very grateful for your contribution. recently, i found out about the differential neural computer implementation from mostafa-samir https://github.com/mostafa-samir/dnc-tensorflow . he approaches the problem of having different sequence lengths in a different way using some dynamic functions provided by tensorflow. this code, clearly, results to be more efficient than the reference code you have provided. i decided to replicate the ntm implementation following the same approach and i ended up with this https://github.com/camigord/neural-turing-machine . i have made the proper references to your code and approach. i hope you don't mind. best,
