 URL : "https://github.com/OpenSourcePolicyCenter/PolicyBrain/issues/786" TITLE : gui input types BODY : in issue 782, @matthjensen commented: > just my 2 cents, i am more eager for taxbrain to be able to accept true/false than for either taxbrain or tax-calculator to accept 1.0, 1, 0, 0.0. we just have so many numeric inputs, including switches, it refreshing to differentiate switches. the current behavior for the new comma separated boolean value allows for case-insensitive true and false as well as 1.0, 1, 0.0, and 0. these values are then converted into python boolean type variables true or false . it seems like there are a couple different options for the new comma separated boolean parameters: 1. current behavior allow any input close to boolean true/1/1.0 or false/0/0.0 , convert that to boolean type true or false variable, and send the python boolean type variable to tax-calculator 2. allow any input close to boolean true/1/1.0 or false/0/0.0 , convert strings to python type false --> false or 1 --> 1 , and send the converted values to tax-calculator 3. only allow case insensitive true/false includes true, true, etc. and 1, 1.0, 0, 0.0 are not valid gui inputs, convert the input string to python boolean type and send to tax-calculator i prefer 2 . i presented my reasoning in open-source-economics/tax-calculator 1782: > i implemented a temporary fix note: this temporary fix is current behavior in this commit https://github.com/opensourcepolicycenter/policybrain/pull/782/commits/d64c6067d08a2e7707bfac819e467894470851a9 . this fix will be removed once the next version of tax-calculator is released. > > the fix isn't necessarily bad, but it does introduce unneeded complexity. further, i think it makes policybrain a little too opinionated. past experience suggests that parameter checking and conversion at this level should be left to taxcalc. however, i would like to hear the perspectives of others on this issue.
