 URL : "https://github.com/henrychavez/materialize-tags/issues/45" TITLE : free input and objects BODY : hello there, thank you for your awesome plugin... i'm using it in two situations... first, for an input where i don't need freeinput with objects, everything work perfectly. second, i use this plugin to autocomplete with tag objects, and let user create a new tag if it's not present in the suggestion list. my problem appears only on mobile device is when i enter text for a tag ex: res for restaurant , the tag shows in the list, but if i click on the suggestion to quick select 'restaurant' , the event.item logged with on beforeitemadd is only res ... it seems that the event triggers first the text value entered before the suggestion choice, so the suggestion choice is not triggered... how do you handle this ? many thanks,
