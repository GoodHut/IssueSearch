 URL : "https://github.com/volkanceylan/Serenity/issues/3092" TITLE : group management & gui BODY : hi, can i request the addition of group management http://johnatten.com/2014/08/10/asp-net-identity-2-0-implementing-group-based-permissions-management/ or core version. also the _master details grid samples with approval button on each row_ is missing, any chance you add a sample, for e.g. document approval in the master grid row, with document details and versions in the child grid. thanks
