 URL : "https://github.com/technion/ruby-argon2/issues/17" TITLE : ship a new version? BODY : hi! i noticed that the current version of this gem doesn't build on smartos a solaris derivative . this is because support for smartos / solaris was added on 28th of may in 2016 see: https://github.com/p-h-c/phc-winner-argon2/blob/master/makefile l88 and version 1.1.1 of the gem uses an april 2016 version of argon2. could i tempt you to make a 1.1.2 release? i'll buy you a beer for it if your ever in rotterdam ;-
