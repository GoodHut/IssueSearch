 URL : "https://github.com/bpampuch/pdfmake/issues/1211" TITLE : option for paid support BODY : i am no sure if this is the right place to ask this question, but as we start using this awesome library into the application, management is asking question about support behind this product line. a recent question asked was what is the date for 0.2.0 availability? how can we get support for international languages? so question to the team, is there an option to get paid support?
