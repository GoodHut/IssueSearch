 URL : "https://github.com/ymotongpoo/vsc-licenser/issues/23" TITLE : custom copyright text BODY : sorry for not using a template as this is not really a bug report but rather a question or enhancement request. this extension is very cool! the best of ones i explored. it only seems to lack support for custom copyright text. i want to add headers like copyright <year> my company blah blah blah . do you plan to support this or maybe already do in some hidden way?
