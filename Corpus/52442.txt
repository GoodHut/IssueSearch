 URL : "https://github.com/landlab/landlab/issues/596" TITLE : code cleaner for users BODY : prompted by 593 and also previous examples of this, it would be nice to provide users with an automated tool to search their code and replace renamed methods. i'm thinking something like: >>> update_code_to_new_landlab_version 'users_code_file.py' running ll code update... found deprecated method neighbors_at_node . replaced with neighbor_nodes_at_node 20 instances found deprecated function imshow_grid . replaced with imshow_grid_at_node 2 instances ... you could also do, e.g., >>>update_code_to_new_landlab_version '.', recursive=true this i think would be an easy win, and quick to implement. it would just be a careful search & replace on the users' code. the hard part might be retaining a file listing all our renames - though we should have been doing this anyway!! thoughts welcome on whether this would be worthwhile. happy to implement as a utility ? if people think it would be worth it.
