 URL : "https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/countryyear/issues/4" TITLE : iso codes importer BODY : @cjyetman your iso code importer looks awesome, but i wasn't able to run it locally. for some reason rselenium which i have never used before can't find my local phantomjs installation and prints a warning that phantom support will be remove anyway . should i just go back to the csv file i copy/pasted manually from the iso website?
