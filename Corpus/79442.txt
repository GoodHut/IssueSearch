 URL : "https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/issues/6987" TITLE : sharedctypes for ndarray BODY : in my data iterator, i want to fill an array with multiple threads. right now, the code fill def next self : <snip> i = 0 try: while i < batch_size: image, bbox = self.next_image label = 1 if bbox else 0 data = self.get_patch image, bbox batch_data i : = self.postprocess_data data batch_label i : = mx.nd.array label i += 1 except stopiteration: raise stopiteration if i would do this in parallel with numpy i would write the data to a sharedctypes.rawarray and when done apply the function np.ctypeslib.as_array to this. what is the right way to do this in mxnet?
