 URL : "https://github.com/Syndaryl/DFRPGRandomDungeonGenerator/issues/17" TITLE : template monster support BODY : things like fungus and ooze can change a fair bit in cer depending on random choices in creation. we need to develop a function that picks the needed subtypes and adds them to the monsters, then spits out a new cer for them. once this works overall, it would be neat to be able to support something like adding a warlord template to an orc and adjust cer accordingly.
