BODY : hello, i have a very basic issue regarding how to select specific cells using the whichcells function. i am not sure what language to use for the ident= argument in whichcells. for example, for my seurat object named n2_a with clusters 27 cell clusters named 0-26, how to i output a list of cell barcodes in that cluster, and then how do i make a seurat object with only those cells? eg: whichcells n2_a, ident = ?, cells.use = 10000, subset.name = ? i would eventually like to call differential expression in the various clusters across samples, and make volcano plots of the result. any help would be greatly appreciated. thanks!
