 URL : "https://github.com/proftpd/proftpd/issues/550" TITLE : redis select database BODY : what i did we are trying to use mod_redis for gathering info about stor-ed files onto our ftp-server. we have 2 environments: dev and prod. each environment uses different database in redis-server. 1 - prod, 2 - dev. redis-server from the box supports command select to choose database https://redis.io/commands/select . what i expected/wanted we saw that mod_redis unable to choose concrete database with command redisserver ip :port password in config, but it will be very useful to have such functionality. otherwise we should have multiple redis-servers, 1 per each environment. but it is more simple to have only 1 redis-server with several databases in it. proftpd version and configuration $ proftpd -v 1.3.7
