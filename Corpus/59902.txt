 URL : "https://github.com/apple/swift-protobuf/issues/334" TITLE : validate group parsing BODY : spun out of 333. if the nextfieldnumber loop sees a field that is a startgroup, it doesn't seem to ensure everything to the endgroup goes into the unknowns for the message. the unknown handling needs to deal with groups, if the field number wasn't known, it needs to ensure all the subfields make it into the messages unknowns. the catch is this can be recursive, there could be another startgroup so it needs to read until both endgroups. we might want to double check that the normal group parsing ensure the endgroup is found and that the startgroup wire type was seen. on quick look, i think the startgroup check is there, just not sure about the endgroup vs. data happening to end
