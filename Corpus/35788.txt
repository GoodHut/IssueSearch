 URL : "https://github.com/Twentysix26/26-Cogs/issues/13" TITLE : feature request rift BODY : - ability to have the bot show usernames on both sides of the rift. - ability to have each rift associated with an id therefore rifts can be closed individually if linked from the same channel and also means it's less prone to accidental closure. a list with channels associated with ids would also be needed
