 URL : "https://github.com/didierfranc/redux-react-starter/issues/4" TITLE : question: backend server BODY : i guess it is a general question about best practices: there's a reference to a backend api server in urls.js https://github.com/didierfranc/redux-react-starter/blob/master/src/constants/urls.js l4 . where is the code for this server? do you think that this starter kit should also show-case handling of booth backend and front-end code in the same repo? particularly in production, because of the payment model of services like heroku.
