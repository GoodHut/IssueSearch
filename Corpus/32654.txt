 URL : "https://github.com/hpchud/vccjs/issues/4" TITLE : waiting for network BODY : at the moment, clusternet has to run when the network is up to write our hostname and ip to the init_run_dir/init.yml file. any subsequent service reads the config file for this info. instead, we should have function in vccutil module that gets the hostname or ip, blocking until it is available. so we can start the service as early as possible and it will wait until an ip address is available. the rest of the services will still start in the correct order because of the dependency ordering, and would call the util function again whenever they need to get the hostname or ip. a network change during the execution of a vcc is probably going to be disruptive to the application. but the vcc daemons should handle this gracefully, i.e. keys registered in discovery should update with new hostname / ip.
