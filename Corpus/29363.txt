 URL : "https://github.com/microdotblog/issues/issues/56" TITLE : line feeds in posts BODY : when composing this post i used line feed characters with the expectation that each bulleted list item would start on a new line. https://johnbrayton.micro.blog/2017/06/05/wwdc-hopes-faster.html if i look at the source for the page i can see that the line feed characters are there, but that the formatting is lost in html. i ask that either new line and carriage return character sequences be converted to <br> elements or that the css hard wrap on line feed / carriage return sequences. i think i recall seeing similar behavior by the ios app when displaying that post, but the post has gotten old so i no longer see it in the app.
