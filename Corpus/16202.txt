 URL : "https://github.com/rsandor/Solace/issues/22" TITLE : hunger and thirst BODY : implement a hunger/thirst mechanism for player characters in the game. after considering this for a spell i think it should be baked into the engine and be distinct from things such as buffs. further, i think this system should be completely optional and fully configurable via a configuration file hunger.config.xml ? . i was lead to this conclusion because while solace is a role-playing game at heart, different game implementations on the engine may not be rp heavy and authors may wish to rid their players of the burden of buying 28 pot pies before they go dungeon crawling.
