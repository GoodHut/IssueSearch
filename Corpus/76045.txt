 URL : "https://github.com/greenham/alttp-bot/issues/1" TITLE : inaccurate stream alerts BODY : occasionally, the timing works out to where a title change will happen without the game being updated, causing an errant stream alert to be sent. to resolve, when a title is changed, delay the notification by a few minutes to ensure the game hasn't been changed. this is also somewhat of an issue for newly live streams -- streamers will sometimes start without first updating their title/game. the same delay could also be implemented, at the cost of less timely alerts.
