 URL : "https://github.com/heroku/12factor/issues/140" TITLE : latin-extended font needed BODY : for the turkish translations, language specific characters like ş,ğ,ı doesn't shown properly. let me give an example: <img width= 189 alt= screen shot 2017-03-08 at 11 14 44 src= https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2081802/23695487/18a041b8-03e8-11e7-9071-66122cf31074.png > as you can see the ş character has a problem in its styling. i think, the latin-extended version of sirba here http://catalog.monotype.com/font/typetogether/sirba/regular which is the current document-wide font family will fix this issue.
