 URL : "https://github.com/firefly/wallet/issues/1" TITLE : please add mesh of case BODY : i downloaded sketchup, and tried exporting .obj files of the case, but when i do it, part of one of the sides seems to be non manifold, and so it's unprintable. could you also add some correctly meshed versions of the case, so they're ready to be 3d printed, without needing sketchup?
