 URL : "https://github.com/PaulStanley/oscola-biblatex/issues/5" TITLE : a few comments BODY : your biblatex guide sparked my interest in your other biblatex project, and so i thought i might leave a few nit-picking remarks here as well. the name macro in https://github.com/paulstanley/oscola-biblatex/blob/master/oscola.bbx l74 uses the outdated command \ifpunctmark{'} which has been superseded by \ifprefchar . you also use \ifblank , but the version of name:family-given in biblatex.def uses \ifdefvoid this is necessary due to changes to name handling and the type of the arguments passes to the macros . i might be mistaken, but your definition looks just like the normal definition except that you deleted \revsdnamepunct . so you should get the same result if you don't redefine the macro and instead do \renewcommand {\revsdnamepunct}{} . the code you use starting from https://github.com/paulstanley/oscola-biblatex/blob/master/oscola.bbx l98 to obtain terse initials could probably just be replaced with the terseinits=true option. i did not compare output, but in theory it should do the same. it might be a matter of taste, but i would not use commands in string comparisons as in https://github.com/paulstanley/oscola-biblatex/blob/master/oscola.bbx l213 ewcommand \subtypesecondarylegislation{secondary} and then \iffieldequals{entrysubtype}{\subtypesecondarylegislation} , as i explained in http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/290935/ i prefer \iffieldequalstr instead of \iffieldequals for fixed strings. that does not create the overhead of macros, and i don't need to think about \long commands i.e. using ewcommand so i don't get \long . is there a reason why there is a literal comma in https://github.com/paulstanley/oscola-biblatex/blob/master/oscola.bbx l296's ewcommand{\extracitedelim}{,\space} ?
