 URL : "https://github.com/gnocchixyz/gnocchi/issues/341" TITLE : resource type inheritance BODY : my idea is that each newly created resource type could inherit existed ones and all the attributes of the inherited resource types could be used in the new one. and each type except 'generic' at least inherit one type 'generic'. thus, 'project_id', 'creator', etc., wouldn't have to be treated differently but like attributes, and they could be put into 'generic' beforehand. this is just my thought. do anyone find this useful? or it's overkill?
