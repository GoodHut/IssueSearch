 URL : "https://github.com/tiberiuzuld/angular-gridster2/issues/148" TITLE : /deep/ is deprecated BODY : i just came across this article from google https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/10/remove-shadow-piercing where it says that starting in chrome 63 /deep/ will be removed. there's also a commit to angular https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/b754e60 from june, which also discourages the use of /deep/ . the reason i'm opening this issue is that i can see you use the selector in a couple of places https://github.com/tiberiuzuld/angular-gridster2/search?q=deep&type=code&utf8=%e2%9c%93 . i don't know if this is going to break gridster in any way but it might be a good idea to update the implementation. thanks and keep up the good work!
