 URL : "https://github.com/BrowserSync/browser-sync/issues/1395" TITLE : csp support via nonce BODY : issue details at the moment in order to make browsersync work on site with csp which disables usage of inline scripts i have to generate sha hash i used following script: https://gist.github.com/webreflection/892939bcf8272bf4791f . it would be nice if i could provide nonce instead. that will insure that if i upgrade browsersync, i don't have to generate new sha. if you're not familiar with csp, you can find details here: https://content-security-policy.com/ steps to reproduce/test case try to run browsersync which proxies site with csp which sets script-src to 'self' . browsersync will not initialize unless you specify sha hash. this problem is not specific to node version or os, but you'll need to use browser that supports csp - chrome should be good for test. browsersync use-case - x gulp for all other use-cases, gulp, grunt etc , please show us exactly how you're using browsersync js //gulp browsersync config browsersync.init null, { proxy: https://localhost:${appport} , files: 'public/dist/css/ .css', 'views/ / . ' , browser: chrome , open: external , https: { key: path.join __dirname, './ssl/upload.indigo.ca.key' , cert: path.join __dirname, './ssl/upload.indigo.ca.crt' }, host: 'site.com', port: 443, } ; //code that sets csp app.use helmet.contentsecuritypolicy { directives: { defaultsrc: 'self' , scriptsrc: 'self' , function req, res { return 'nonce-${res.locals.nonce}' } , stylesrc: 'self' , 'unsafe-inline' , upgradeinsecurerequests: true } } ; thank you
