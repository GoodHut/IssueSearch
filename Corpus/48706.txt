 URL : "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/issues/2100" TITLE : sign triplea binaries BODY : in some cases the triplea installer is blocked by windows smart screen when trying to execute it. also we have this problem with the mac installer from the triplea website : > if you get a triplea is damaged and cannot be opened warning, follow these steps: > apple menu > system preferences > security & privacy > general tab under the header allow applications downloaded from: > change allow applications downloaded from: to anywhere > this setting will reset to mac app store and identified developers every 30 days, you may need to repeat this step. signing the binaries created by install4j a built in feature of install4j requires a certificate which are not free . most of the certificates start at 100$ a year which is definitely too much. many forums and websites link to this site: https://www.certum.eu/certum/cert,offer_en_open_source_cs.xml certum seems to offer certificates for opensource projects for about 30â‚¬, one-time-purchase. the donations should be able to pay for that. using travis we'd probably need to base64 encode the private key file into an env var and the base64 decode it back into an actual file. the question: is it worth it?
