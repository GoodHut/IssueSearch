_originally opened as https://github.com/gsscoder/commandline/issues/275_ ---- hi, i'm trying to support the following syntaxes using commandline: keyword -f -h variable and keyword -f variable with -h , text, required and -f boolean, optional. in my scenario, this is equivocal, as h is the only text argument. supporting the first is native using commandline so no problem.
supporting the second one as well i find challenging as, as far as i know, the default parser fails without giving me a partial response or giving me the unbound values. would you have any idea how to use the tool in this manner ?
