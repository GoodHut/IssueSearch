 URL : "https://github.com/shakna-israel/f.lua/issues/14" TITLE : f.let isn't immutable BODY : at the moment: f.let {x = 4}, function x = 2; return x end > 2 this is somewhat surprising for people from functional backgrounds, as let's values are generally immutable. this would be a breaking change, so if we implement it, it should be saved for 2.0.0.
