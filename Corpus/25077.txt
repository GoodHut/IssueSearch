BODY : coming from java, the natural way to implement a framework is call-method-and-return-result . but evidently, this does not fit well in non-threaded runtimes like javascript node.js , which use an event loop and use callbacks for returning asynchronous results. what is the best way to implement this in a ceylon framework that is intended to run on as much backends as possible? using the callback is that called reactive ? approach is rather awkward for this java programmer with no javascript experiences. and what about future backends that bring another execution paradigm that comes as different and surprising as the js approach? could even maybe support the ceylon language provide something, for example like c 's async/await mechanism?
