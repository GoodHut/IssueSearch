 URL : "https://github.com/Animiral/shitbrix/issues/52" TITLE : peek-able spawn queue BODY : when new random-generated blocks enter the screen, they should be taken from a pool where they are pre-generated instead of deciding their random color on the spot. this is not a visible feature, but a prerequisite for other issues like 37 “decouple replay from rng” and the dissolve animation for garbage blocks. it also encapsulates the state of the random number generator to a place where it can later be enhanced to include checkpoints and history for netplay back-tracking.
