 URL : "https://github.com/plasticine/inject-loader/issues/50" TITLE : babelrc config not used BODY : in version 3.0.1 this pr 38 disabled babelrc file configs which doesn't compile my code correctly. > aside from the compact option, i also added the filename option to assist in debugging babel messages like the one i encountered without the filename, it falls back to unknown . adding filename means we also have to set babelrc: false to prevent it from trying to look up an external config file which can interfere with inject-loader . does this option need to be false or is there another way to include my babel config? using the env option in babelrc we can set up a different environment for testing that doesn't interfere with filename .
