 URL : "https://github.com/buildbot/buildbot/issues/3076" TITLE : force all builders BODY : if you have many builders then it would be convenient to have a ui button to force all builders of a forcescheduler. this could be done in buildbot eight with the forceallbuilds=true option hidden away in authz_cfg, though . as far as i can tell there is no way to achieve this on buildbot nine. related: there are still two references to the old forceallbuilds in the repo: ~~~~ $ egrep -ri forceall master/docs/examples/git_gerrit.cfg: forceallbuilds = false, master/docs/examples/repo_gerrit.cfg: forceallbuilds=true, ~~~~
