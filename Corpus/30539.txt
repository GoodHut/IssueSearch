 URL : "https://github.com/r-dbi/RPostgres/issues/152" TITLE : pqprepare vs pqexec BODY : this is less a specific issue and more a high-level question about rpostgres' architecture. the use of pqprepare and pqgetresult for all calls prevents multiple statements from being executed in a single call, which pqexec supports while returning pgresult of the final statement . one common use case for this would be streaming contents of an sql file to a dbi connection, like so: r readr::read_file my_file %>% dbi::dbexecute dbconn, . or dbgetquery is there any planned path with rpostgres to allow use of pqexec? perhaps via a configurable option? pqexec is already used when copying-in data, but all other code paths seem to opt for the pqprepare/pqgetresult paradigm, which for dbexecute and dbgetquery seem to result in additional overhead & restrictions.
