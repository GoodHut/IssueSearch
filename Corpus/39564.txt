 URL : "https://github.com/facebook/reason/issues/1106" TITLE : single variant types BODY : refmt will convert this: re type carowner = carowner string car; into this: re type carowner = | carowner string car; i actually like how this is going to enable really clean git diffs. however, i think its worth mentioning this in the documentation. otherwise its a bit confusing since its essentially superfluous syntax. when i saw that correction i thought what's that | doing? .
