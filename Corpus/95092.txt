sometime over the last couple of years, coqdoc stopped accpeting tokens such as { n} { z} and {1/} as valid tokens. for example, printing { n} $\ensuremath{\mathrel\ _{\mathbb n}}$ yields warning: bad 'printing' command at character 1090
» it appears that coqdoc does not allow mixing symbols and letters in printing tokens. jean-marc notin &lt;<notin@lix.polytechnique.fr>&gt; on 2008-03-26 15:42:15 +0100 this is now fixed in the subversion repository of coq both trunk and v8.1 branches, see revision 10721 , and will be available in the next satble release of coq.
