 URL : "https://github.com/openremote/openremote/issues/59" TITLE : implement public assets BODY : there is a requirement to be able to mark an asset as public and then it should be possible to query/get these public assets without being authenticated. having a 'public' user with hardcoded credentials that are then baked into the frontend doesn't seem great plus would require direct access grant. simple solution maybe: have a 'public' flag on asset remove roles allowed from assetresource::queryassets and to programmatically limit the query to assets with public=true if user is not authenticated realm must be specified in the request otherwise fail i.e. don't allow public assets in the master realm
