 URL : "https://github.com/DestinyItemManager/DIM/issues/2334" TITLE : organize mods by type BODY : there are a lot of mods that have identical icons that can only be slotted into particular armor or weapon types. e.g. arc ordnance mods can be either for leg armor or chest armor. currently, mods are displayed in a big pool, with no way to visually differentiate between a leg armor mod and a chest armor mod without click/tapping for detail, which makes them difficult to manage. i'd suggest separating them by what slot they go into, the same way that armor is currently separated. short of that, some sort of search filter like is:legmod ification , would help.
