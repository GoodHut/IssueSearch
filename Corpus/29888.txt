 URL : "https://github.com/kr/beanstalk/issues/24" TITLE : named tubeset issue BODY : i was trying to place something in a named tubeset but it seems to only go in the default tubeset. conn, err := beanstalk.dial tcp , 127.0.0.1:11300 if err != nil { ... } tubeset := beanstalk.newtubeset conn, email m := // some struct that marshals into json jobbytes, err := json.marshal m if err != nil { .... } jobid, err := tubeset.conn.tube.put jobbytes, 1, 0, 120 time.second then when i try to pull the job out in a different client tubeset := beanstalk.newtubeset conn, email id, body, err := tubeset.reserve time.duration 10 time.second i get a reserve-with-timeout: timeout error but if i switch to just doing the reserve call on the connection using the default tubeset, it pulls the data out without a problem. how do i go about using a different tubeset than the default? could you show me an example?
