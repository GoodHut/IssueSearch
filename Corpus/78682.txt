 URL : "https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/704" TITLE : reading meta tags: title BODY : nuxt provides a way to set the <head> tags vue-meta . it would be great if this can read in from a higher component. for example if your page components sets the <title> tag, it would be awesome if the layout component can listen on the change of title and use it in the template. right now, the only solution is to connect this data in a store. it is a solution but given that the head plugin is available, we should make available the vue-meta object. giving the developer flexibility to listen on changes that vue-meta provides. https://github.com/declandewet/vue-meta changed-function
