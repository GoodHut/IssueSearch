BODY : hello, thank you again for this great package. however since upgrading to ggiraph 0.4.0, i am no longer able to create responsive ggiraph charts. looking at your ggiraph sizing post https://davidgohel.github.io/ggiraph/articles/sizing.html , i understand that the width argument is no longer used. but is there any way to have horizontally responsive chart as it was previously ? i have tried rewriting the sizingpolicy$defaultwidth of a ggiraph object, but it has no effects.
