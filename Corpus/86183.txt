 URL : "https://github.com/bitporch/laravel-forum/issues/153" TITLE : handle deletion cascading BODY : we need to implement deletion cascading for discussions and groups. i think we have two options for handling this: - handle all cascading via eloquent events - use native sql cascades for hard deletes and use eloquent events specifically for soft deletes i think the extra performance of the second option is probably worth the extra bit of effort to implement, but i'll leave this alone for a few days to get feedback before i start doing anything with it.
