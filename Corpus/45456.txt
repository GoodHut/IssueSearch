 URL : "https://github.com/hyperledger/composer/issues/2201" TITLE : id card docs outdated BODY : for the 'creating an id card', 'creating id card credentials' and 'connecting using credentials' subsections, the information given are outdated. - in 'creating an id card', step 7 is no longer required as there is no popup to let the user add credentials to the wallet after clicking the create new button. the gif showing this process also needs updating as a result. - for 'creating id card credentials', you can no longer complete the steps. it is due to the same reason as described above but the result of it in this section is that you cannot get the user id and secret through the method given. this means i wasn't able to finish this subsection successfully. - for 'connecting using credentials', you are unable to use either method given because there is no connect using credentials button on the my wallet page anymore
