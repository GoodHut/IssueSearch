 URL : "https://github.com/natcl/Artnet/issues/16" TITLE : long pixel strands BODY : i’ve been using this code with strips between 200-250 pixels flawlessly however i’ve increased the string length to 388 pixels. once updated to anything over 295 the code no longer works. the initial color flash no longer works and data is no longer sent to the led strip. i tried two different boards on two different strips of 388. i can tell the artnet signal is coming over the ethernet shield as the indicator lights flash when the data is sent.
