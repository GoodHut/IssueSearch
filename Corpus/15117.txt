 URL : "https://github.com/Anedumgottil/VR-Mazmorra/issues/40" TITLE : create a treadbot BODY : as of e8c18d897752605d524bd3a61cd2f819c9773ea9: treadbot exists in game, has a gun, muzzle flash, basic script to control it and give it some ai. it has a model and uv-mapped materials/textures. however, it's ai is extremely rudimentary and barely functions. some of it's noises are broken. ideally, i'd like to get this to fsm status, but we probably won't have time for that by the public release date, so just getting to function in a simple hearing-based and attack on visual kinda setup would be nice. it's armor currently doesn't function and needs some scripting to pop off with damage and protect the treadbot. treadbot can't aim or shoot yet, even though it makes noises and it certainly loves to make noises , but i've removed the godawful fur shader and updated the turret model on it so it can rotate correctly. so it shouldn't be too much work to get the turret spinning and aiming with the ai.
