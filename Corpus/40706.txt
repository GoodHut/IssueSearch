BODY : i just saw this announcement ann of duct , which seems to handle a bunch of weird edge cases in relation to std::process::command . duct : https://docs.rs/duct ann : https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/618jvw/announcing_duct_a_child_process_library_thats/ it looks like we can use it to: - define commands as strings using its sh fn. internally it actually calls /bin/sh / cmd.exe , so it doesn't have to do crazy string splitting it also has a macro . 25 - set working dir 28 - set env vars 27 - pipe stuff into other commands ðŸ˜® - pipe stuff bytes into the program 26 i really like our fluent api, and would suggest adding methods that internally handle duct::expression . cc @nathanross @colin-kiegel @epage
