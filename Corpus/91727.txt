 URL : "https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/3645" TITLE : unresolved bugs in v4.1.3 BODY : the following issues reporting bugs introduced after v4.0.3 are still unresolved: issue 3471 issue 3466 because of these issues, dynamic orderlist is not usable and scrollable feature of datatable breaks header alignment if there is a hidden field in datatable columns. if anyone uses these features, v4.0.3 is the last release in which it worked. so they should not upgrade. although primeng team is not prioritizing these issues, i hope the team will resolve it soon.
