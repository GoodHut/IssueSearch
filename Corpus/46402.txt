 URL : "https://github.com/gregtyler/Murder/issues/5" TITLE : make the assassin lie BODY : the assassin should lie about their whereabouts, neighbours and items. this means: - it will be harder to just luck out on who the assassin is by asking where they were - it will be easier to catch the assassin by trapping them in a lie presumably they should only lie about the murder scene, but i'm not sure how that should be determined.
