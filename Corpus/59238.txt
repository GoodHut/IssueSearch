 URL : "https://github.com/ESMCI/cime/issues/1096" TITLE : timer defaults in cime BODY : with the following code in namelist_definition_drv.xml it would seem that profile_detail_limit can never be set to a value > 1 without using user_nl_cpl. timer_level > 1 means timer_level='pos' a number of cesm users have requested that this variable have a different default 4 so that some timers are always on by default. however acme wants 0 to be the default. these values look backward to me - i think we want 0 when timer_level='neg' and timer_level when 'pos' and then set timer_level=0 in the xml for acme. do you agree? <entry id= profile_detail_limit > <type>integer</type> <category>performance</category> <group>prof_inparm</group> <desc> </desc> <values> <value timer_level='neg'>$timer_level</value> <value timer_level='pos'>0</value> </values> </entry>
