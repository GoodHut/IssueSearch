 URL : "https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow/issues/237" TITLE : php built-in web server BODY : for developers it could be interesting to use php as web server http://php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php , for example on your local computer. this doesn't seam to work with yellow. it looks like php doesn't set up cgi variables http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3875.html the same way as a web server does. in particular, with apache script_name = /yellow.php , with php script_name = / . not sure if this is a bug or a feature. i guess we need a workaround?
