 URL : "https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/issues/1305" TITLE : idle time reset on notice BODY : filing this report as suggested by attila molnar in recent discussion on https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/issues/438 currently, inspircd resets a client's idle time when they send a notice. this behaviour is not present on any other servers i know of. i can confirm that efnet/undernet/freenode don't do this. given ctcp replies are sent via notice, a side-effect of this behaviour means that on an inspircd server, i can reset someone's idle time merely by pinging them. would love to see inspircd adopt historical behaviour for notice. thanks for your time and consideration.
