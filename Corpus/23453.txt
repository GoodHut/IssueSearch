 URL : "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3098" TITLE : plugininfos api v3 BODY : issue type - feature enhancement summary the plugin infos index call https://api.gocd.io/current/ get-all-plugin-info renders a shallow version of the plugin info https://api.gocd.io/current/ get-plugin-info . the original idea was to save on server rendering performance, bandwidth and client side round-trip time by not rendering the view template and plugin settings metadata. we were unsure whether we'd really need to make additional calls to individual plugin infos. as things stand, the biggest chunk of the plugin info the icon for elastic agents, and now authorization plugins , is now rendered as part of the index call. additionally most single page apps that we're building requires us to make several calls to unshallow the profile, thereby causing a lot of complexities in the client by having to lazily unshallow, exception handling on each ajax call, etc after talking to @maheshp â€” we're now leaning towards unshallowing the plugin info call since the original argument client side round-trip and rendering performance are an almost negligible performance, but high cost of implementation on the single page apps.
