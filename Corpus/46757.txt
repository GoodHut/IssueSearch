 URL : "https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/247" TITLE : more typechecks: warn BODY : add more typechecks, esp. with assignment. when casts can be added to satisfy types, do it with a warning. when not error at compile-time. %myclass::; my myclass @a; $a 0 = ; needs to error. we cannot add a cast from str to myclass. on the other hand most coretypes can be casted, so we only through a type warning: my int @a; $a 0 = ; warns and inserts a int .
