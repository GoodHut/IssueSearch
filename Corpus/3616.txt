 URL : "https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/issues/595" TITLE : so many times BODY : most of the time people spent on im is group chat, especially a serverless pc messenger, no server, no offline messages. adding friend, send message, all these are troubles. in a p2p im, people get less friends than other im, if you want they keep using it, they must get more messages, they need group feature.group chat should be the no.1 feature need be added after basic messaging function. tox's group was bad, people need to creat it when they log in every time. right, it is p2p, no data be saved in server, but i think an universal value of a group can be created in everyone's drive, when you log in, if the tox can't find it online, then creat it. it can sovle the problem. so many times, the topic be discussed, but it still be that, seriously group chat should be the no.1, if you want more people use it. many people just try it and go, i had read the roadmap, see group chat, don't know what will be, but it is too late in the timeline.
