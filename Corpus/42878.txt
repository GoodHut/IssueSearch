 URL : "https://github.com/andmarti1424/sc-im/issues/202" TITLE : cannot open help file BODY : i just installed sc-im via the new homebrew formula. very smooth! however, typing :help returns the error: > cannot open help file i'm not sure if this is actually a problem with the homebrew formula&mdash;my recollection is that :help worked in a older version i compiled myself&mdash;so let me know if i should report over there instead.
