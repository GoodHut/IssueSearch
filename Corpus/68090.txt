 URL : "https://github.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/pixiedust/issues/468" TITLE : releases are not tagged BODY : there have been at least a dozen releases of pixiedust on pypi up to 1.0.11 and now 1.1.0 , but there's only one tag here on github. this makes it awfully hard for any observer to track which changes have gone into which release. or even to find out which releases there are, because pypi hides all but the latest. https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pixiedust https://github.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/pixiedust/releases would it be possible to create tags for the code levels you're releasing to pypi? https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/git-basics-tagging
