 URL : "https://github.com/Erkan-Yilmaz/Gridcoin-tasks/issues/98" TITLE : howto: compile on windows BODY : if it is feasible you could maybe write a short manual on how to compile for windows. or ask rob if could publish some of the scripts? don't know maybe there is a reason for not self compiling on windows but it would be great for testing now and then. cc @denravonska @gridcoin
