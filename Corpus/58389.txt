 URL : "https://github.com/Tonejs/MidiConvert/issues/17" TITLE : should tracks have ids BODY : should there be an id property on each track, which corresponds to its index in the tracks list? that's the reason i changed type s to interface s https://github.com/tonejs/midiconvert/pull/14/commits/fb45b352389dd8366f3fab1748440f2aeebe08cb , so i could add id as a consumer of midiconvert, but that seems both useful and lightweight enough that it might belong upstream. it ensures that no matter how the tracks data-structure is transformed for presentation for instance, sorted by instrument or by channel , or if a track is being passed around independently of tracks , it's still easy to identify which track it represents.
