 URL : "https://github.com/red-eclipse/base/issues/660" TITLE : improve bot personalities BODY : with the latest release there were some changes to the bot randomisation that included using the random seed to define bots with a sort of personality same name picks the same colour . to give bots even more variety, we should create another variable with a set of vanities they can pick from outside the forced vanities they already have . further to this idea, it would be even more interesting to give bots specific behaviours based on their chosen persona, but this is an advanced goal and not a requirement for this issue.
