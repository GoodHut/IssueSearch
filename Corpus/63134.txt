 URL : "https://github.com/danielquinn/paperless/issues/253" TITLE : deploye at non root url BODY : this seems like a very good application. thank you for efforts in creating this app. i respect the vision and agree with it. i am trying to deploy this behind in existing environment which has an apache installation serving several websites. i would like to use my apache webserver as a reverse proxy to access paperless . however i am also deploying this at a non-root url of an existing virtual host, e.g., https://mydomain.tld/paperless when i setup the reverse proxy, the django service keeps throwing back the root url, thus failing. is there a configuration for setting this path/url? regards.
