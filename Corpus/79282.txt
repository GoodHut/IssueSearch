 URL : "https://github.com/fabiandev/css-animator/issues/7" TITLE : security risk elementref BODY : hey, first thanks for this nice tool. i started to use it and it works great. but as i looked around i have a look at the angular docs and found that elementref could be a security risk. https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/core/index/elementref-class.html they suggest to use their render which is at experimental state at the moment. no the question is: is it possible to use your tool with the renderer? or are their no security risks if you only use elementref for animation?
