 URL : "https://github.com/tus/tus-node-server/issues/72" TITLE : split upload directories BODY : hey guys..like the idea of tus and resumable uploads because connections are really sluggish here in per√∫ at times..even wired connections üëç even though at least the node server looks a little abandoned at the moment?! am i correct that it used to support koa.js? does it still? and what version? now to the topic, i'm splitting my upload directory in incremented folders 1, 2, 3, ... to reduce number of files in a single folder how can i do this using tus-node? how to create a new directory if specified limit reached? maybe checking file count on upload complete and then just passing new dir to fileserver.datastore.path ? and i'm not yet sure how serving those files work..i can just serve them using koa of course but i try to understand tus and custom get handlers so right now opening the url of an uploaded file won't do anything besides logging handle: get /files/726e2c46be5fd77c4b8661f0a1cec62a any input appreciated :
