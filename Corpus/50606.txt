 URL : "https://github.com/ethereum/ens-registrar-dapp/issues/175" TITLE : 26 failed transactions BODY : i'm sorry you've run into bugs. gas costs are your own responsibility; this is spelled out quite clearly in the 'understand the process' dialog on the dapp. if you'd like to help us track down the bugs, please submit as much detail as you can about the failed transactions at https://github.com/ethereum/ens-registrar-dapp/issues/new. https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0xd8977dc775209e8a265790e84749614e3ffc10e0 any time the system said i ran out of gas, it was because i was trying different variables to try and get a transaction to complete. i initially used all of the recommended gas limits. after many failed transactions, i started trying different inputs. i would appreciate some refunds for this mess. being a programmer myself, i know when i run into buggy software. i realize this is still early on in this entire process. i don't mind running into problems, but i do feel it is unfair to lose several hundred dollars in the process.
