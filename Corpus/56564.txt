 URL : "https://github.com/pombase/canto/issues/1326" TITLE : no allele autocomplete BODY : the allele name autocomplete seems not to be working. i type part of an allele name, but don't get any suggestions, let alone the one i want. i know it's in chado somewhere, because it shows up on gene and genotype pages, and at least some of the papers have been done in canto. seen with cdc6 looking for cdc6-23 in session 76a3cc41b9c66144; tried firefox, safari and chrome.
