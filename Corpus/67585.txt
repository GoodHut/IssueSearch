 URL : "https://github.com/antonioribeiro/health/issues/54" TITLE : problem with installing BODY : i followed the steps starting here https://github.com/antonioribeiro/health installing to install via composer v0.3.1 . i added the serviceprovider to config/app.php and called php artisan vendor:publish . i cannot find the facade to add this to config/app.php i'm using laravel 5.3 . where does it live? i manually created the config/health directory - it wasn't already created - and added a simple test config in config/health/nginx.yml using the example you provided . when i hit the /health/panel route, it's not there. artisan doesn't have the health commands either.
