 URL : "https://github.com/formsy/formsy-react/issues/7" TITLE : react 16 support BODY : once use of deprecated api is removed from the code, this should mostly come down to actually allowing react 16 as dependency. i'd suggest allowing either v15 or v16 as a peer dependency. both react and react-dom packages should be covered. we should test with both react 15 and react 16 to make sure we don't break anything for users who are still stuck with older versions of react.
