 URL : "https://github.com/jalev/godo/issues/7" TITLE : update ids to be hashes BODY : the id of a task should be a hashed id of some kind. we could use a truncated sha256 much like git does. this requires updating the data structure of the todo to; updating this also requires that the list , edit , and finish / unfinish functionality be updated. it can take a full sha256 id or a partial sha256 id. you should now be able to do the following: $: godo list --id 30ac1 id: <sha256> title: my first to do description : i have made my first todo! due date: <iso 8601> if godo is unable to find the id, the existing behaviour should continue to work. additionally, if multiple results are found for a given id, we should error and exit as though no results were found.
