 URL : "https://github.com/refinery-platform/refinery-platform/issues/2015" TITLE : strip down data_sets_old? BODY : in conjunction with 2014, we no longer need the old file browser, so i guess it should be removed, leaving the provenance and matrix views? but maybe we'll be able to port those in the near-ish future, and trying to excise just the browser would be more trouble than it's worth?
