 URL : "https://github.com/renNut/sprint-test/issues/3" TITLE : create a new reward BODY : as an administrator i want to create multiple rewards so i can offer tiered rewards to my users to keep them sharing my content - rewards will be delivered via email only.
- no triggered reward will be displayed on the site.
- users will be able to see how many rewards they have received admins can add details: internal name title description set maximum number of rewards upload an image presently we have 'items' attached to rewards. this is a brain ache and needs discussion.
