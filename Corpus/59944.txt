 URL : "https://github.com/Firebottle/Firebot/issues/21" TITLE : version checker errors BODY : the version checker is supposed to match the apps version in the package file to a json file on firebottle.tv and if they are different it should display a new version message with a link to the github releases page. right now this works perfectly in dev, but upon building the app it breaks.
