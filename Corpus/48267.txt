 URL : "https://github.com/systemjs/plugin-less/issues/11" TITLE : resolve package paths BODY : the only way i could find to reference a package that contains a less file is to add @import '../../jspm_packages/github/distros/bootstrap-less@3.3.9/bootstrap/index.less' . which is obviously going to easily end up in a maintenance nightmare down the road. the import statement in the typescript plugin for example properly resolves the package, without any version information attached, unless the paths start with . or .. . is there a way to specify the paths in a similar fashion with this plugin, e.g. @import 'bootstrap-less/bootstrap/index ? thanks.
