 URL : "https://github.com/twittem/wp-bootstrap-navlist-walker/issues/6" TITLE : media upload broken BODY : hello twittem! after including your wp_bootstrap_navlist_walker.php i'm not able to upload any images. my media library dont stops loading and doesnt shows any content. if i clear the functions.php, the library works fine. but surprise, surprise! fatal error on the frontend. did you hear about that problem? i can exclude that it is a config problem. i have already changed the max_upload size. it seems that im the only one with that issue. i dont speak/write english very well, excuse me if i have written stupid stuff :/ best regards anne
