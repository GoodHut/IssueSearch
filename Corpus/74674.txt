 URL : "https://github.com/webpack/webpack-cli/issues/228" TITLE : feat: add --babel option BODY : <!-- please don't delete this template or we'll close your issue --> <!-- before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of webpack. --> <!-- also consider trying the webpack@beta version, maybe it's already fixed. --> do you want to request a feature or report a bug ? <!-- please ask questions on stackoverflow or the webpack gitter https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack . --> <!-- issues which contain questions or support requests will be closed. --> what is the current behavior? using future syntax in webpack configuration files requires the use of a .babel.js extension or running webpack with babel-node . if the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce. <!-- a great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a github gist. --> <!-- best provide a minimal reproduceable repo --> <!-- if your issue is caused by a plugin or loader file the issue on the plugin/loader repo --> what is the expected behavior? if this is a feature request, what is motivation or use case for changing the behavior? it would be nice to support an option to use babel syntax without needing a specific file extension, e.g., with a --babel cli flag. eventually, this could become the default. please mention other relevant information such as the browser version, node.js version, webpack version and operating system. --- this issue was moved from webpack/webpack 6182 by @sokra. orginal issue was by @andersdjohnson.
