 URL : "https://github.com/krakenjs/xcomponent/issues/116" TITLE : add teardown for button BODY : i'm integrating paypal checkout in an ember app and am trying to avoid accumulating memory leaks. i have an ember component that calls paypal.button.render ... . rendering that component adds listeners, etc, but unrendering it does not clear them. watching the performance tab in chrome and toggling the button on and off shows a steady increase in memory use and listeners. i was looking at the existing framework integrations angular, react , but i don't see any teardown implemented in those. is the button supposed to handle teardown itself in a single-page app? are there public methods for teardown? i saw teardown functions in xcomponent , but i was unable to figure out how to use them.
