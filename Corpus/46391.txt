 URL : "https://github.com/ekmett/reflection/issues/34" TITLE : make reify polykinded BODY : currently, we have haskell reify :: forall a r. a -> forall s :: . reifies s a => proxy s -> r -> r i believe we probably want something more like haskell reify :: forall a r k. a -> forall s :: k . reifies s a => proxy s -> r -> r i have no particular opinion on the order of the type variables. is there some fundamental reason this won't work? is there some fundamental reason it's not desirable?
