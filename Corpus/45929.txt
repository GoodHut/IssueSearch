 URL : "https://github.com/Sonarr/Sonarr/issues/1896" TITLE : issues with hardlinks BODY : when i use manual import to move a series to my library location, the hardlink setting is not respected. the reference to the files is lost for transmission. i initially thought this might be an issue with hardlinks not working because i have transmission in a docker container. but doing an ls -l on the imported files shows only 1 reference, which i'm not wrong means that those are the only references to the files, and the hardlinks were not created.
