 URL : "https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene/issues/592" TITLE : explain connections better BODY : from the docs at http://docs.graphene-python.org/en/latest/relay/connection/ > a connection is a vitaminized version of a list i'm a beginner to graphql, so maybe vitaminized is a graphql term that i don't understand yet, but i have no idea what this actually means, and neither did any of my colleagues. we'd appreciate a clarification to the documentation around this specifically. more generally, i don't really understand the difference between _type_s and _node_s, and when i would use one or the other. i understand that _node_s have something to do with relay, but i'm not quite sure what. some explanation about what the difference is, how to choose between them, and how _node_s and _connection_s fit into the picture would be great.
