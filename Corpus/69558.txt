 URL : "https://github.com/thinkpixellab/kaxaml/issues/3" TITLE : the kaxaml site is down BODY : dear developers of kaxaml. the site www.kaxaml.com http://www.kaxaml.com - it looks to be expired. i don't know if that was intentional or an over site, considering the waning popularity of wpf although xamarin is on the rise . i have taken over rewriting andrew troelsen's book on apress pro c , splitting duties with andrew on the last edition 7th , and now as a solo writer for the c 7.1 version 8th edition . i use kaxaml in the chapters on wpf since it's such an excellent tool for teaching and experimenting with xaml. i would like to continue to use it in the book, so i wanted to reach out to you to see what my options are. do you plan on reviving kaxaml.com? if not, would you be opposed to me forking the repo and using that in the book? or i can just point out this repo in the book, but provide a compiled version for the readers to download. it's the 1 book in apress's .net catalog, so i want to do right by the readers and right by you. thank you for your time and consideration. philip japikse @skimedic
