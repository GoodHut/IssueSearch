 URL : "https://github.com/bartolsthoorn/NVDSP/issues/37" TITLE : no tag v0.0.1 BODY : as already noted in 35, there is no tag v0.0.1 . you created a tag 0.0.1 without a 'v' but in the .podspec it's referenced as v0.0.1 with a 'v' , so you need to either add the v to the tag name or remove it from the podspec in order for the pod to work normally. otherwise users have to add nvdsp to their podfile like this : pod 'nvdsp', git: 'https://github.com/bartolsthoorn/nvdsp.git', branch: '0.0.1'
