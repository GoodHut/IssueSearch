 URL : "https://github.com/cpetry/AntSim/issues/5" TITLE : error in ant coloring BODY : once you start a simulation and after that restart it with the simulation button - as i usually do when changing seeds - the colors of the ants now get mocked up. however, this error did not exist until merge, possibly not even after. i guess, it has to do with the changed ant numbering somewhere between commit 14 196df... and 15.3 b927b... .
