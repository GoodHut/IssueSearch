 URL : "https://github.com/minio/minio-js/issues/598" TITLE : support for proxies? BODY : is there any way to instruct minio to connect to the endpoint using a proxy? i can't see a way to pass in a proxy config. i thought it would be possible to use a library such as global-tunnel https://github.com/np-maintain/global-tunnel , which monkey-patches http.agent, but minio sets its own agent to support keep-alive and overwrites global-tunnel.
