 URL : "https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/issues/219" TITLE : admin menu queries BODY : we should be able to query for admin menus. the wordpress application data graph consists of _much more_ than just data stored in the database. i'd like to be able to hydrate a decoupled interface with the same menu pages that are defined in the wp admin. something like: adminmenuitems { edges { node { title menutitle capability slug iconurl submenuitems { edges { node { title menutitle slug capability parentitem { title menutitle capability slug iconurl } } } } } } }
