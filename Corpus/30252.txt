 URL : "https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugin-push/issues/1555" TITLE : opt-out of cocoapod BODY : expected behaviour one can build ios app that uses phonegap-plugin-push without cocoapod. cocoapod should not be needed if the app uses apn on ios app. actual behaviour ios app that uses phonegap-plugin-push does not work if cocoapod is not present on the build environment. plugin fails to get installed. either build stops there or the app builds without phonegap-plugin-push in it. reproduce scenario including but not limited to we use ionic cloud. everything is working with phonegap-plugin-push at 1.8.x, but not with 1.9.x. the server does not have cocoapod, and is out of reach of us customers. the resulting .ipa archive is missing phonegap-plugin-push plugin within the bundle. steps to reproduce 0. upgrade any app that uses phonegap-plugin-push 1.8.x to use 1.9.x. 0. have your ci server build your app as usual. - without cocoapod installed 0. launch the resulting app to find that the plugin is missing. platform and version eg. android 5.0 or ios 9.2.1 n/a android what device vendor e.g. samsung, htc, sony... n/a cordova cli version and cordova platform version cordova cli version on our ci server ionic cloud is unknown. following platforms are specified in config.xml: <engine name= ios spec= 4.3.1 /> <engine name= android spec= 6.1.2 /> <engine name= browser spec= 4.1.0 /> plugin version working: <plugin name= phonegap-plugin-push source= npm spec= 1.8.4 > <variable name= sender_id value= filtered /> </plugin> not working: <plugin name= phonegap-plugin-push source= npm spec= 1.9.2 > <variable name= sender_id value= filtered /> </plugin> sample push data payload n/a sample code that illustrates the problem n/a logs taken while reproducing problem n/a
