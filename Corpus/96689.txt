 URL : "https://github.com/antonioribeiro/tracker/issues/255" TITLE : feature: purge old records BODY : hi, i am not sure whether this is actually something anybody has run into yet, or everybody just ryo'd a solution for this. i am using this package, albeit an older 2.x version, in production. it has a mediate amount of traffic, so now the tracker tables have made the database size grow from ~70mb to 500mb+ in less then a year. so for us that is not sustainable, especially since we don't necessarily want to keep the data forever. i am aware of the option to keep the tables on a different database, but even then i think it would not always be necessary to store forever. so perhaps this package could include a feature to delete every record older than <insert-some-configurable-business-rule/>. is that something you agree with?
