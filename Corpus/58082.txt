 URL : "https://github.com/xcllnt/openiked/issues/13" TITLE : rsa pubkey auth broken BODY : commit 69e8de575d5b41148728c6d33d6430991050b96a broke rsa public key authentication when connecting to openbsd iked. specifically, it's losing the first 16 bytes of the peer public key and then corrupting an additional 7 or 8 bytes of it, causing decoding failures during verification. i guess there's a missing check to ensure that certificates are actually in use as opposed to bare rsa keypairs before doing whatever that code change is doing.
