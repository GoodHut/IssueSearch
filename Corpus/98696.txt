 URL : "https://github.com/Airblader/i3/issues/150" TITLE : keybind to hide indicator? BODY : hey @airblader, is there a way to hide the indicator? by default it doesn't show, then when you press mod+v, the indicator shows. now if i create a new window, the indicator disappears back to the border colour, when i close that new window, the indicator comes back. or if i press mod+v by accident or even change my mind about creating the new window i'm stuck with the indicator on that window. it would be nice unless it's already a thing and i'm completely overlooking it in the docs to have the ability to set a keybind to hide the indicator if i no longer have any need to see it. much love yo! :+1:
