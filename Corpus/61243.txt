 URL : "https://github.com/cmprescott/ansible-xml/issues/104" TITLE : allow to set attributes BODY : it seems it is not possible at the moment the set element's attributes as the set_target function check if xpath is a node. the goal would to set attributes like this: xml: xmlstring: <connector port= 8080 protocol= http/1.1 connectiontimeout= 20000 uriencoding= utf-8 redirectport= 8443 /> xpath: /connector/@port value: 8081 that would be very useful i think. if i missed something jus let me know.
