 URL : "https://github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap/issues/380" TITLE : allow only 1 user BODY : if a user is logged in physically console and then connects remotely same username , both session remain connected. i would like to have only the remote user connected and only 1 remote user. is there any way to accomplish this? i changed a few options in the configuration file, but no luck. the only reason i want to use this application is to allow multiple monitors in windows 7. if there is another option, please let me know. p.s.: great application. thank you.
