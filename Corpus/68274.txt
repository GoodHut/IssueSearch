 URL : "https://github.com/ProjectCeleste/Celeste_Server/issues/170" TITLE : request: pages on mail. BODY : i've noticed that there are only 2 pages, each with 5 mail slots. i might be wrong but my memory tells me that there were 4 pages max. would it be possible if i remember correctly of course, to extend the mail with 2 more pages? also when looking at expiration date, again i thought that was 1 month aka 30 days seems to be a fortnight 14 days likewise is it possible to extend if that was the original design?
