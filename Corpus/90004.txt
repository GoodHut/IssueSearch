 URL : "https://github.com/src-d/go-git/issues/488" TITLE : reverse repo.references ? BODY : i need to walk the references in a reverse order newer to older . didn't find a way of doing that until now. i ended up getting all the refs and reversing the slice, something like: go var refs plumbing.reference iter, _ := repo.references iter.foreach func ref plumbing.reference error { refs = append refs, ref return nil } sort.slice refs, func i, j int bool { return i > j } for _, ref := range refs { // blah } this doesn't seem efficient, as i'm holding all refs in a slice. is there a better way of doing that? fwiw, i'm doing that to get the latest 2 tags https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/pull/311 , with the git + exec.command impl i was doing a git describe for that. thanks for the great lib btw üçª
