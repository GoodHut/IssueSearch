 URL : "https://github.com/luc-github/ESP3D/issues/145" TITLE : web interface redesign BODY : web interface based on templates takes alot of time for cpu process and data sending. i have make some web modifications but for old relese 0.6.0. i think it is posible port it to current develop branch. common ideas: move css, js to separate files and add caching for it like: webserver.servestatic /css/ , spiffs, /css/ , max-age=8640 ; webserver.servestatic /js/ , spiffs, /js/ , max-age=8640 ; also replace tpl files by html and also add it to chach. and all data which you need to replace like '$some_param$' gets by json requests and replace by using javascripts inside web browser
