BODY : hello, my project uses version 2.4.0, and i want to improve performance, so upgrade to 3.0.0. however, i refer to a library using 2.4.0, i can not let the development of this library guy also upgraded to 3.0.0 . so i have to add in my build.gradle: compile 'de.greenrobot: eventbus: 2.4.0' compile 'org.greenrobot: eventbus: 3.0.0' my question is: does this do not reduce performance? should i be upgraded to 3.0.0? thxÔºÅforgive my english is not good
