 URL : "https://github.com/jdcalus/STSA-Workshop-2-WCS/issues/2" TITLE : duplicate steps in lab BODY : at first glance it looks like steps p and q are exactly the same step, both the description and the screen shot. is it a duplicate, or is one of them supposed to be a different step that didn't get documented?
