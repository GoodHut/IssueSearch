 URL : "https://github.com/nenad-zivkovic/yii2-basic-template/issues/6" TITLE : google font api included BODY : the included themes make use of the ubuntu font. while this is not a problem, since alternatives are given, the main.php layout file references the google font api. therefore, google gets a request any time a page using this unmodified template and can thus track its usage. i assume that was not intended. if at all, the font css should be referenced by the style.css and not in the layout, so that by changing the style, one can eliminate the google reference.
