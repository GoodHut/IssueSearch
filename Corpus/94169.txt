 URL : "https://github.com/google/codeworld/issues/543" TITLE : broken formatting in guide BODY : this section under top down animation in the guide is presumably supposed to be a table but is displayed as a long string of text: | expression | type | meaning | | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | | t | number | an instant in time. | | ball | number -> picture | the entire animation. | | ball t | picture | the single frame of ball at some point in time | | thickcircle t, 1 | picture | the meaning is identical to ball t | is there a <pre></pre> missing?
