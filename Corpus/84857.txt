 URL : "https://github.com/marmistrz/loadprefix/issues/1" TITLE : doesn't work on archlinux BODY : i git-cloned the repo and tried running ./loadprefix.sh /opt but it failed with bash: ./loadprefix.sh: permission denied . this might be because the script isn't marked as executable. i can chmod it and try again, but it's a bad ux for a new user. please set the executable bit on the script in the repo.
