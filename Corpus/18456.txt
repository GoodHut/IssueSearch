 URL : "https://github.com/christophd/citrus/issues/196" TITLE : test cases in xml BODY : i would drop support for xml test cases. if someone wants xml they can built a citrus addon for that. my guess is that there are very few citrus users who choos xml test scripts. when i look into the documentation to me it is polluted with xml examples, but i am interested into java examples.
