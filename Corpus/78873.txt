 URL : "https://github.com/dart-lang/build/issues/333" TITLE : remove the phase concept BODY : as build_runner's asset graph gets smarter we should need to rely less on having a 'phase' done before running further builders because we can avoid reading or listing the wrong assets based on the graph rather than strictly what exists on disk. we should replace the phase with a buildaction , and possibly the phasegroup should just be a list<buildaction> . i think i've only seen phases which consist of a single build action anyway - but if there are uses cases we think we'd be losing we should take a close look.
