 URL : "https://github.com/structr/structr/issues/493" TITLE : uri redirection issues BODY : the 'uri redirection from remote source' issues flagged by lgtm.com: https://lgtm.com/projects/g/structr/structr/alerts/ seems vulnerable. the first two may be susceptible even though the redirect parameter is prepended with '/' see http://homakov.blogspot.co.uk/2014/01/evolution-of-open-redirect-vulnerability.html and the last one does not have any slash prepending to it. thanks.
