 URL : "https://github.com/mattallty/micromist/issues/1" TITLE : small small world BODY : i just wrote a minimist -like argument parser yesterday and called it micromist . mine just groups arguments together and then you would iterate and give more meaning to the results. https://github.com/m59peacemaker/micromist/blob/master/index.test.js what are the chances we both wrote a module with a similar purpose and name almost at the same time? i just thought you might be interested to know. have a good day!
