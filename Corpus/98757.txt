 URL : "https://github.com/akeeba/fof/issues/647" TITLE : language strings generator BODY : hi @nikosdion i've written a small cli tool that parses through a specific fof30 component and generates the language file for any language installed frontend and backend by parsing all the php + xml files that fof uses and putting them into the .ini file joomla expects. it also generates all the titles + messages related to the creation / editing / deletion of models. would that be useful as a part of the fof cli tool?
