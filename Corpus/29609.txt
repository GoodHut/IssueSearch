 URL : "https://github.com/TylorS/typed/issues/18" TITLE : maybe.of vs tomaybe BODY : i was looking through the source code and saw that maybe.of is an alias for just.of , and tomaybe does a null check before either returning a nothing , or passing the result to maybe.of / just.of . i was expecting maybe.of to also do the null check and return a nothing or a just . is there a standard way of thinking about of and toxyz in these kinds of datatypes in fp in general?
