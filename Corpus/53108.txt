 URL : "https://github.com/SimonJF/links/issues/2" TITLE : decouple proc and json BODY : really, json shouldn't depend on anything -- it would be much nicer to separate out the state gathering and jsonisation passes into two separate files, meaning that then json could be called from proc, neatening a lot of the webserver stuff.
