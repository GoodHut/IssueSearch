 URL : "https://github.com/IDSIA/sacred/issues/164" TITLE : argparser with sacred BODY : we are trying to convert an existing model training program to be used with sacred. the program imports a model and uses argparser to set the parameters. is there a best practice for combining sacred with argparser? we would like to continue to use argparser because it allows for us to use the help functionality. thanks!
