 URL : "https://github.com/lmenezes/cerebro/issues/111" TITLE : aws sigv4 request signing BODY : aws managed es clusters have a wonky permission scheme where you are essentially forced to choose between having your cluster open to the world or to add a signature to your request headers. could someone pretty please look into implementing this here? i poked around with doing it but scala code feels like a buttered up snake to me. a few examples of where this has been implemented elsewhere and aws docs for sigv4: - https://github.com/enalmada/play-elasticsearch/blob/master/module/app/services/amazonsignerscala.scala - https://github.com/carsales/aws-request-signer/blob/master/src/signer.js - http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-v4-examples.html signature-v4-examples-java
