 URL : "https://github.com/trangptm/Column_networks/issues/1" TITLE : multiple errors in code BODY : i'm running this code with keras 1.2.0 & theano 0.9.0, but got several errors: - there's a statement using arg_dict '-stsize' in the code, but that argument is not defined in the arg parsing code, hence it throws an error. - the training instructions provided is not correct, default model is dense rather than highway as specified in the instructions. the argument -layers should be -nlayers for the mini_batch example - the constructor of graphhighway throws the following error traceback most recent call last : file training.py , line 53, in <module> n_classes=n_classes, shared=shared, nmean=nmean, dropout=dropout file column/mini_batch/create_model.py , line 161, in create_highway init=init, activation=act, transform_bias=trans_bias file column/mini_batch/graph_layers.py , line 33, in __init__ super graphhighway, self .__init__ kwargs file local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/keras/engine/topology.py , line 323, in __init__ raise typeerror 'keyword argument not understood:', kwarg typeerror: 'keyword argument not understood:', 'rel_carry' after commenting out arg_dict '-stsize' , i was able to run the full batch code with dense setting. but for mini batch version, i still have the following error traceback most recent call last : file training.py , line 57, in <module> n_classes=n_classes, shared=shared, nmean=nmean, dropout=dropout file column/mini_batch/create_model.py , line 209, in create_dense model = model input= inp_nodes, contexts , output= top_nodes file local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/keras/engine/topology.py , line 1745, in __init__ inputs_set = set self.inputs typeerror: unhashable type: 'list'
