 URL : "https://github.com/mirceta/kmcht/issues/5" TITLE : fix messy configuration BODY : currently, there is only 1 mechanism for configuration in gui.py. here is how it works: - there is a configuration stored in /data/config.txt where examples of . gui.py looks for config.txt and takes out the path to cheatsheets folder, pdflatex. it doesn't get created automatically. when a user changes a value in a text field, the file config file should get updated as to persist state between sessions of using the program. the config file should be in a folder mean for program state that the user shouldn't touch and is not of user's concern and not mixed up with examples.
