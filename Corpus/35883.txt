 URL : "https://github.com/bitwarden/browser/issues/400" TITLE : firefox search vault BODY : when i click on the addon icon and start to type something to search on my vault the very first character i type is never typed but it is used to switch from the tab tab to the my vault tab, is it the expected behaviour? i'd like if it counts also my first character typed. just for example, i click on my addon icon, click to enable the search vault field and i type google it shows only oogle . i hope i was clear enough to explain this weird behaviour.
