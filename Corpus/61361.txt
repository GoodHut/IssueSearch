 URL : "https://github.com/bizzomate/DatagridContextMenu/issues/1" TITLE : app store version issue BODY : hi jelle, i saw your submission to the app store. a few weeks ago we introduced a check for the version of widgets which is a requirement for the web modeler. the reason the app store is complaining about the version number of your widget is that the version number which is generated in the app store, does not match the version number in the package of your widget. if you can correct this on this line https://github.com/bizzomate/datagridcontextmenu/blob/7f5477291d5b6a141c6e3f1e5af563bc6f2261ee/src/package.xml l3 you're all fine
