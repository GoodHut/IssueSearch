 URL : "https://github.com/jonashartmann/webcam-directive/issues/56" TITLE : angular 1.5 dependency BODY : does the directive work with angularjs version 1.5? i can see in bower.json that it requires angularjs ~1.4.0 which would only resolve to 1.4.x. if the library supports 1.5 then bower.json should mention >=1.4.0. i have troubles installing the directive if angular 1.5 is added as a dependency in my bower.json because the correct version of angular cannot be resolved my app wants 1.5 and webcam-directive needs 1.4 .
