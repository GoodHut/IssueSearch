 URL : "https://github.com/jarun/nnn/issues/22" TITLE : cd on quit not working . . BODY : . . on mint 18.1 x64 cinnamon, using nnn 1.0-3. i did jump through the necessary hoops, to wit: added the code to my bash.rc file and indeed i tried it in a user rc file and a system one ; invokved nnn not with nnn but with n ; started a new terminal. also, i tried using nnn's cd command rather than just navigating folders. but when i exit the program, my terminal remains in the folder it started.
