 URL : "https://github.com/arose/ngl/issues/395" TITLE : bug in superposing BODY : whenever a mol2 file is used in superposing either as the one being superposed, or the one being superposed to the structure that is being superposed disappears from viewer without errors and i can't seem to get it back. i tried show/hide structure and adding different types of representation but nothing is working. this was tested on official ngl web application and in personal application using code with latest updates. i would really appreciate if you would fix this. thank you.
