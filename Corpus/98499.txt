 URL : "https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/issues/5199" TITLE : is driver a reserved word? BODY : checklist - x i have verified that that issue exists against the master branch of django rest framework. - x i have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate. - x this is not a usage question. those should be directed to the discussion group https://groups.google.com/forum/ !forum/django-rest-framework instead. - x this cannot be dealt with as a third party library. we prefer new functionality to be in the form of third party libraries http://www.django-rest-framework.org/topics/third-party-resources/ about-third-party-packages where possible. - i have reduced the issue to the simplest possible case. - i have included a failing test as a pull request. if you are unable to do so we can still accept the issue. steps to reproduce 1. create a serializer with a field named driver . 3. add the line > driver = serializers.serializermethodfield 3. add a method get_driver self, obj expected behavior serializer:driver value should be the value returned by get_driver method. actual behavior field driver is ignored in serializer. if you renamed driver by other field name and get_driver by get_{new field} is ok.
