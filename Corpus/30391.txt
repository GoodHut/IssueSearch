 URL : "https://github.com/geobarrod/KDE-Services/issues/1" TITLE : pdf issues recently BODY : hey guys, firstly thanks for this amazing project : been using for a longggg time and love it! anyway at some point in the past couple months maximum believe closer to 1 month the pdf tools completely stopped working, i know it had nothing to do with your package and more likely the latest kde updates but wondering if have any idea. i have all the tools necessary as that hasn't changed, but using pdf compress for example does nothing - at one point i saw an error pop up saying something about cannot find command %f - or something of that sort, variable f and a hyphen but didn't get to catch it. i upgraded to the latest kde-services and still no luck/not seeing error anymore but still not doing anything. any ideas appreciated! arch linux x64 latest kde looks to have broken it some point in past month
