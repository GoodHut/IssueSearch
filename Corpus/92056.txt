 URL : "https://github.com/truly-systems/glpi-sdk-python/issues/17" TITLE : user token auth is broken BODY : hi @mtulio, i just tried to use your module with a user token generate in profile and noticed that this is not supported. seems to be related to https://github.com/truly-systems/glpi-sdk-python/blob/e0bb986bb58dfffd2c83c25e882931f919a274f6/glpi/glpi.py l213 using the static auth parameter. as far as i understand the rest api docs, one needs to send an authorization: user_token xxx header. the auth param of request seems to default to basic auth. could you have a look at this? thanks! poikilotherm
