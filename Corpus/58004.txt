 URL : "https://github.com/tmeasday/create-graphql-server/issues/52" TITLE : reuse model instances? BODY : i noticed this because one of my models starts polling on creation. we're not giving any request info to addmodelstocontext , so is there a point to creating new model instances for every request? if not, we could just do it once: js + const context = addmodelstocontext { db, pubsub } + const app = express .use ' ', cors app.use bodyparser.urlencoded { extended: true } app.use bodyparser.json app.use req, res, next => { - req.context = addmodelstocontext { db, pubsub } + req.context = context next
