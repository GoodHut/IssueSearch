 URL : "https://github.com/wright-group/WrightTools/issues/155" TITLE : links in docstrings BODY : i prefer the rst link format where the links are separated from the hyperlink text this makes lines shorter silencing flake8 warnings often, unless urls are particularly long and also makes it in my opinion easier to read, as the urls clog up the view when most of the time i am not interested in them unless i am explicitly looking for the link. for short urls, it is still appropriate to have it in line, as those are not too distracting, and can be useful the link url is available, and the syntax is such that it is clear a link is indicated, and the url should be relatively close by.
