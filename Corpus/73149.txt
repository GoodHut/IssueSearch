 URL : "https://github.com/lukearmstrong/localhost/issues/8" TITLE : config directory changed BODY : it's perhaps worth noting that the updated apache brew now uses /usr/local/etc/httpd for configuration instead of the original /usr/local/etc/apache2 . for anyone who used this tutorial previously like me and is wondering why their server broke after brew update that would be why. there's an issue posted with a suggested manual fix for this: https://github.com/homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/18732. btw, thanks for this post. it was massively useful when setting up a new development machine earlier this year.
