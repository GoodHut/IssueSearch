 URL : "https://github.com/XeroAPI/Xero-Java/issues/50" TITLE : get attachment inputstream BODY : this is a feature request. i am using amazon s3 to store xero attachments. the amazon java sdk can be given two handles to save a file to s3, either java.io.inputstream or java.io.file. see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsjavasdk/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/s3/amazons3.html putobject-java.lang.string-java.lang.string-java.io.inputstream-com.amazonaws.services.s3.model.objectmetadata- it would be great if the xero sdk could pass back an inputstream for an attachment. at the moment i have to download the file to my server disk and then pass a handle for that to s3. i assume it would be a lot quicker if i could pass an inputstream handle to straight to s3.
