BODY : hello, i connected a esp8266 and an arduino pro mini. when trying to load the sketch to the pro mini it fails as the two controllers are constantly exchanging data over uart. my idea is now when the bootloader recognizes that a new sketch is going to be uploaded then the bootloder could pull a pin high which then triggers reset on the sp8266 and stops so the uart transmissions. is there a way to pull eg pin4 high during flashing a new sketch?
