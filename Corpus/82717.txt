 URL : "https://github.com/kylefarris/clamscan/issues/20" TITLE : api to scan a byte stream BODY : i don't see an api mentioned in documentation that will allow me to pass the byte stream. only option seems to be file location. just want to know if there is any way to pass the full byte stream of the file to the scan api. note: we don't want to store the file on local before calling scan due to limited size of disk space.
