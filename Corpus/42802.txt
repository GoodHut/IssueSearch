 URL : "https://github.com/chapter-three/AppleNewsAPI/issues/22" TITLE : can't find curl class BODY : hello, i just installed this library on my local machine running with easyphp. i followed the installation guide, but when i try to use the example file to post an article i get the following error: fatal error: class 'chapterthree\applenewsapi\publisherapi\curl' not found in c:\easyphp-devserver-16.1\spip\applenewsapi\src\publisherapi.php on line 20 now i am not familiar with namespaces and aliases... is this a common error newbies encounter? is it the fact that the classes are in a src folder, that is not mentionned in the namespace? thank you for your time. benoit.
