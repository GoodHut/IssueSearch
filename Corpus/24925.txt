 URL : "https://github.com/ole-vi/planet/issues/213" TITLE : unit test coverage BODY : so i found that there is some built in test coverage tool for unit tests with the angular cli/karma. not sure how we want to use it, but before i forget the command for creating the coverage report from the vagrant vm is: ng test --browser=chromeheadless --code-coverage we might be able to run this in travis to get our code climate test coverage reports working.
