 URL : "https://github.com/revaturelabs/trackforce/issues/30" TITLE : database button responses BODY : situation: in spring tool suite only delete and populate button will successfully execute the first time they are clicked, with proper message in response being displayed. continual clicks however, will display response text indicating success,without performing the respective action. this exists through sts browser refresh and server restart. only closing and reopening sts seems to fix. this issue does not arise on an actual chrome browser.
