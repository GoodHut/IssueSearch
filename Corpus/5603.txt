 URL : "https://github.com/pylorak/reloadmatic/issues/7" TITLE : reload at time BODY : i have a whether forecast page that actualizes its value ~14 minutes after the full hour. it would be nice to have an option with a mask: every hh:mm:ss , so that: every 12:15:00 reloads every day at 12:15:00 every hh:14:00 reloads 14 minutes after every full hour and so on i think i haven't seen that so far anywhere! you can even think of using a mask with days: every dd:hh:mm:ss to enable a reload at the beginning of a month ...
