 URL : "https://github.com/andyholmes/gnome-shell-extension-mconnect/issues/30" TITLE : support mouse moving BODY : upstream has problems https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=380078 with wayland currently, so one cannot move the mouse when trying to remote control it via the phone. i can click and use keyboard input, but moving the cursor does not work. can you do anything about it? as the extension is tightly integrated into gnome, maybe it can make it possible?
