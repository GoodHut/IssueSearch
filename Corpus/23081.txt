 URL : "https://github.com/hms-dbmi/higlass/issues/179" TITLE : no menu on higlass BODY : i tried to set up higlass on my computer yesterday but i had some problems because i have windows home eidition. so instead of docker, i am now using docker toolbox. things seemed to be working but when i open higlass in the browser, it has no menu - i just see higlass in the upper left corner of the window and the short description of what it is but i cannot open any documents. i would appreciate any help with solving this problem. i was told to use chrome but it did not help - looks the same irrespective of the browser i am using.
