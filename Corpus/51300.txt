 URL : "https://github.com/lukehutch/fast-classpath-scanner/issues/128" TITLE : additions to classpath BODY : thanks for sharing this great piece of software! it's a great utility. i'm having an issue, though. i want to dynamically add new jars to a process while it is running. to do this, i'm getting an instance of the urlclassloader and calling addurl through reflection, and also updating the java.class.path system property. if i use class.forname, i can then get an instance of one of the classes, so i know the jvm class-loading is working with this hackery jars are from an https url, if it matters . if i do all of this before calling the fastclasspathscanner the first time, it also finds the classes. however, if i call fastclasspathscanner.scan once, modify the classpath, and then create a new instance and scan again, i don't see the newly added classes. this implies some sort of caching is going on. do you know of any simple workarounds? i didn't see anything in the docs.
