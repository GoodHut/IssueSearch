 URL : "https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/issues/1163" TITLE : merge toml docs BODY : hello, i'd like to suggest merging all the documentation about the cargo.toml file into one webpage. somehow i never find the information i need on the first page i land on when searching, and doing multiple find in page searches across multiple pages is more work than doing it on a single page. i propose merging these pages into a single page: http://doc.crates.io/manifest.html http://doc.crates.io/pkgid-spec.html http://doc.crates.io/build-script.html http://doc.crates.io/config.html http://doc.crates.io/environment-variables.html http://doc.crates.io/specifying-dependencies.html i'm less convinced about merging in 'the guide': http://doc.crates.io/guide.html strictly because i can see the value in a short and sweet walkthrough. two pages would still be easier for me than the current maze of twisty pages all alike. thanks
