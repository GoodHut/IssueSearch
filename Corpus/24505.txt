 URL : "https://github.com/omriabnd/UCCA-App/issues/1" TITLE : support for docker BODY : hi omri, as briefly mentioned yesterday, i'd like your project to have a dockerfile for an easier installation process. basically you can create a requirements.txt that contains all the pip dependencies. os dependencies can be defined a file called dockerfile afterwards, you could use a makefile we used this in one of our project but you can simplify it a lot and probably remove the volume mapping: https://github.com/pan-webis-de/magic/blob/master/makefile and simply type make build in order to fully install every dependency you have. well, a user still has to change some values in your config file, but just typing one command to install your awesome tool makes it much more appealing to distribute/use. unfortunately, i have bad wifi at the moment and can't write a working file from the top of my head. otherwise i would have submitted a pull request ; if you have troubles setting up the dockerfile, please ping me next week and i'll try to help you.
