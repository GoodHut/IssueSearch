 URL : "https://github.com/platformio/platform-atmelavr/issues/44" TITLE : arduino i2c wire no data BODY : versions ide: 17.3 core: 3.2.1 config env:nanoatmega328 platform = atmelavr board = nanoatmega328 framework = arduino lib_deps = wire i am trying to move from the arduino ide to platformio and that is not as simple as copy/paste but i am getting there. the issue i run into at the moment is an i2c device lm75 using the wire.h library that returns no data. i have taken out as many bits and pieces as possible to isolate the issue. include <arduino.h> include <wire.h> void setup { wire.begin ; // join i2c bus address optional for master serial.begin 9600 ; // start serial for output } void loop { wire.requestfrom 0x48, 2 ; // request 6 bytes from slave device 2 while wire.available // slave may send less than requested { word c = wire.read ; // receive a byte as character float t = float int c / 32 / 8; serial.println string t ; // print the character } delay 500 ; } this exact code works when i use the arduino ide but not when i use platformio. in the past this was due to difference in pin names. here, since it is using i2c this will not be the case. i have use an i2c scanner and the code finds the chip and the address is as it should be, 0x48. but the request or read from wire gives an other result when i built with platformio than when i build with arduinol ide. i have taken the arduino wire library and overwritten the platformio version same code with this just to be sure it's equal.
