 URL : "https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-spring-boot-starter/issues/237" TITLE : release 2.1.1 fix BODY : sorry to bother you again, @hawky-4s- , but @stefanzilske fixed the dependencies for the gradle module and i think it's a good idea to release a hotfix while there are no new features on master instead of waiting for the 2.2 so release version: 2.1.1 new and old dev version: 2.2.0 thank you!
