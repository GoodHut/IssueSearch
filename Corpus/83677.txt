 URL : "https://github.com/Ecogenomics/CheckM/issues/128" TITLE : checkm initialize inquery BODY : @wwood i have a question related to checkm database initialization. when i use checkm-genome, one step of checkm intialization needs to download the checkm_data_16012015_v0.9.7.tar.gz. in case of multiple samples, i was wondering whether this step could be done only once, without do this process in each run, for our computing nodes in the cluster has no external internet connection due to security reasons, only the head node have the connection. after i decompress manually the database, the database will be removed but could not download again. in addition, i noticed that the latest version of checkm still require python<3.0. will this could caused problem in download under python3.5? thank you.
