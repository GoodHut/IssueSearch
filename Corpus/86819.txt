 URL : "https://github.com/nais/naisd/issues/27" TITLE : improve error propagation BODY : when performing calls to fasit, we only print the status code, and not the body. today a error might look like this: error getting fasit resources: failed to get resource for testcredential%! extra errors.errorstring=fasit gave errormessage: %!s missing 400 pipeline } while the body itself from fasit looks like this: environment ci does not exist in fasit would be a lot easier to debug if this was passed through to the user
