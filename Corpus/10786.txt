 URL : "https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd/issues/1368" TITLE : deprecate pkcs 1 BODY : deprecating pkcs 1 would allow us to replace legacykeyserverenginefactory with netty4serverenginefactory . legacykeyserverenginefactory shells out to openssl and thus requires us to use library/java:openjdk-8-jre as a base docker image. this change would allow us switch out base docker image to library/openjdk:8-jre-alpine , which does not include openssl.
