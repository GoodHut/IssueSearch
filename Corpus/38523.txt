 URL : "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/1843" TITLE : possible fd leakage. BODY : see https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/cri-containerd/issues/448. cri-containerd also leaks fds in this case, because fifos are not closed by containerd when fail to start container. thus our log redirection goroutine is still running, keeping the fd open and trying to direct container outputs. i'll try to fix this. however, we still need to fix the socket leakage.
