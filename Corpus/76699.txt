 URL : "https://github.com/js-accounts/graphql/issues/2" TITLE : looking for contributors BODY : would be great to have some contributions to this repo. some thoughts on design this repo is split up into 4 packages akin to https://github.com/js-accounts/rest, @accounts/graphql , @accounts/graphql-express , @accounts/graphql-hapi , @accounts/graphql-koa . the @accounts/graphql package should implement the transport interface https://github.com/js-accounts/accounts/blob/master/packages/client/src/transportinterface.js and call the relevant mutations. the apollo client should have middleware to do token validation and refreshes. would be nice to allow a user to provide their in app instance of the apollo client. the schema can be defined in the @accounts/graphql package as well. the other server side packages should provide the necessary middleware for each server and optionally standup an instance of the server consuming the middleware, this could be useful in the case when you want to create an authentication microservice without writing extra code. i have a suspicion that the bulk of the server code could be extracted and shared with https://github.com/js-accounts/rest.
