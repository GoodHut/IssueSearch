 URL : "https://github.com/evanbergeron/DND-5e-LaTeX-Template/issues/50" TITLE : package folder structure BODY : one of the first thiings i encountered when using this package was that i instinctively wanted to put my own images in img, leading to a crowded folder. what does everyone think about going from the existing structure: -|-img |-lib |-root files to: -|-dndlib | |-img |-root files in other words, renaming the lib folder to dndlib so it is less generic and placing the img folder within dndlib to encapsulate the entire package aside from dnd.sty. this strikes me as more of a nice to have than a critical issue, but it would make people's projects cleaner. what does everyone think?
