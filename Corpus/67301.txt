 URL : "https://github.com/conda-forge/petsc-feedstock/issues/15" TITLE : petsc with hypre and ml BODY : it seems that hypre and ml are not supported in petsc for the conda-forge build. it is unfortunate that we cannot use these preconditioners especially boomeramg in hypre with petsc because hypre's amg implementation is the best for many problems we tested. is there a plan to build with them at least hypre for conda-forge? i know that there are no feedstocks for hypre and ml on conda-forge yet, and --download-hypre and --download-ml are not allowed during the building process. maybe hypre and ml's source codes can be directly included in the petsc source tree? thanks!
