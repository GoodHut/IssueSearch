 URL : "https://github.com/ronzeidman/ng2-ui-auth/issues/104" TITLE : login request issued twice BODY : hi, i'm not sure why but the http post request is fired twice on a login. i'm playing with the demo of the project. now i read stuff about hot and cold observables where we have to use the share but that doesn't seem to work either... this is my login function: login logindata: ilogindata { this.auth.login logindata .subscribe { error: err: any => this.eh.handleerror err , complete: => this.router.navigatebyurl 'main' } ; } any idea? thanks so much,
