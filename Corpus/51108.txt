 URL : "https://github.com/kaby76/AntlrVSIX/issues/3" TITLE : add rename refactoring BODY : as we have handy a list of all symbols, it's possible to implement a rename feature to rename a terminal or non-terminal across all files. the advantage of this, over a pure text replace, is that it changes symbols in the grammar, not in comments.
