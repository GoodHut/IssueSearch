 URL : "https://github.com/circus-tent/chaussette/issues/85" TITLE : enable bjoern in python 3 BODY : bjoern supports python 3 since version 2.0.0. so i think it should be enabled. one caveat: during my testing i could only get bjoern to work flawlessly with so_reuseport set to true in my circusd config. without this option i would get a hang every 200 requests or so. why i'm not sure.
