 URL : "https://github.com/lyfeyaj/swipe/issues/60" TITLE : wrong initial item width BODY : the problem seems to be identical to this https://github.com/voronianski/react-swipe/issues/98 one. i'm using the react component. trying to run swipe.instance.setup in componentdidmount does not work since it's undefined, only when the page completely renders is when setup can be called and does what it's supposed to do. the width seems to be correct on mobile though.
