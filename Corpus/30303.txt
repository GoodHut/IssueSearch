 URL : "https://github.com/mgr32/PsISEProjectExplorer/issues/81" TITLE : outline and regions BODY : great extension! i really like to have all my scripts available in one click and be able to see the functions in them. my issue is more a request or a wish: i would like to have an outline of the script i'm working on. instead of the functions in alphabetic order, to have the list of the regions and functions in the order in which they appear in the script hierarchically like you already have for functions and sub-functions . would that be possible? does it require a lot of work? if you can give me some pointers, i will look into it although i'm not a developer. thank you for your great work!
