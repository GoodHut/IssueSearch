 URL : "https://github.com/renlok/WeBid/issues/441" TITLE : paypal not working BODY : hi ive using your lovely script on my website and have linked it to my paypal account so to recieve payments but just recently my users were failing to pay now the auctions they would have won or later buy now with an error on the paypal sandbox page saying things don't appear to be working at the moment. please try again later. tried later but nothing is solved. so went to https://www.paypal-knowledge.com/infocenter/index?page=content&id=faq2067 and got the solution that the pay.php file isn't supposed to include $ sign when passing amount to the paypal page since pay pal has adjusted their standards to not include. i now ask for your assistance on the page. ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14816994/27771142-1d66beae-5f49-11e7-837e-215c4fad569d.png
