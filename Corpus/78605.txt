 URL : "https://github.com/MoonStorm/Dapper.FastCRUD/issues/91" TITLE : question: bulk inserting BODY : hi we are using your framework for persistence and it is going well so far. the new feature we are developing requires the ability to do bulk inserts. i was just wondering if there was any support for it outside of what i have found in the docs https://github.com/moonstorm/dapper.fastcrud/wiki inserting for doing this? if not are you guys willing to accept contributions for this? i might be totally barking up the wrong tree here, so opinions are most welcome. i also know i can do this using dapper contrib but i would prefer to stick with one pathway for achieving this. thanks!
