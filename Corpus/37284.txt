 URL : "https://github.com/DotSpatial/DotSpatial/issues/1088" TITLE : loadextensions crash BODY : if bug, include this part: steps to reproduce 1. create a winforms app. 2. wire up the application manager, header, statusbar, toolbars, menu bar, map, legend and so forth 3. start application and call applicationmanager.loadextensions ; after initializecomponents in form. dotspatial version: 1.9 expected behaviour i assume that the form should load correctly and be usable. actual behaviour the application crashes at loadextensions with the stack trace as noted below. looking in the code repository at menubarheadercontrol.cs:line 284 the offending line is just: _tspanel.controls.clear ; presumably either the _tspanel itself is null, or the controls collection is null. looking around i think the problem is that i am not using a toolstrip container, therefore there are no toolstrippanels. however the crash itself doesn't give much in the way of info to help with it. i also don't recall seeing anything about tool strip containers in the examples i have come across. i don't know if this will help or not. but i thought i'd report it. at dotspatial.controls.header.menubarheadercontrol.loadtoolstrips in g:\teamcity\buildagent\work\8dcaae3a01f0640d\trunk\dotspatial.controls\header\menubarheadercontrol.cs:line 284 at dotspatial.controls.spatialheadercontrol.applicationmanageronextensionsactivated object sender, eventargs eventargs in g:\teamcity\buildagent\work\8dcaae3a01f0640d\trunk\dotspatial.controls\spatialheadercontrol.cs:line 58 at dotspatial.controls.appmanager.onextensionsactivated eventargs ea in g:\teamcity\buildagent\work\8dcaae3a01f0640d\trunk\dotspatial.controls\appmanager.cs:line 439 at dotspatial.controls.appmanager.loadextensions in g:\teamcity\buildagent\work\8dcaae3a01f0640d\trunk\dotspatial.controls\appmanager.cs:line 411 write a description of the feature. how should it work? how should it look? include some graphics if this could help!
