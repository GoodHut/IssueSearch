 URL : "https://github.com/agilgur5/trim-canvas/issues/3" TITLE : image quality regression BODY : hi, i used this script in my app, after erasing ended, all image returns with erased parts removed and then module takes canvas and returns canvas. however if you use it on same bitmap 5-6 times distinguishable quality regression takes place. but its not like pixelating, more like gaussian blur. i tried context.imagesmoothingenabled = false inside function with no luck.
