 URL : "https://github.com/dyng/ctrlsf.vim/issues/181" TITLE : preview with mouse click BODY : i cannot tell if this is a supported feature, but after reading the docs and not finding anything i thought it might be worth posting an issue here in case it was not supported: is it possible to open results in a preview with e.g. ctrl + left mouse click? if not, would adding support for it be hard?
