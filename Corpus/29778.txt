 URL : "https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/issues/3741" TITLE : monitor bundle size BODY : our compiled js is massive and it's really easy to inadvertently make it more massive by including a bundle that depends on lots of other bundles which are all browserified in. bloat in our app makes life difficult for users trying to update over poor internet connections. find a way to make it more obvious when a change results in a larger bundle size. this shouldn't be a blocker because some changes are worth the additional file size, but we need to be aware of the tradeoff. consider using this bundlesize module https://github.com/siddharthkp/bundlesize 2-build-status which shows a warning in travis when your branch results in larger bundles than master.
