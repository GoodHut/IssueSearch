 URL : "https://github.com/jinmingjian/sde/issues/23" TITLE : formatting seems not right BODY : the current sourcekit's formatting is line-based and only do indentation when formatting. so if you have multi-lines ill-indented. only the first become indented right when formatting. the workaround do multiple formatting. because we should format the buffer other than the file in the storage, the swift-format is not used here although i am open to add an option. how about format on save ?
