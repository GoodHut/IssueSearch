 URL : "https://github.com/ansible/ansible-container/issues/362" TITLE : create k8s modules BODY : in support of run , and execution of artifacts produced by shipit , ansible container will rely on a set of k8s ansible modules. initial modules to support existing shipit functionality, the initial set of modules needs to include the following: k8s_common k8s_service k8s_deployment k8s_pvc persistent volume claim in theory these same modules should work for openshift. one distinct difference between k8s and openshift is the route object. openshift exposes a service externally by defining a route, where k8s can expose a service directly. if it's possible, the strategy should be to produce a single set of modules that supports both k8s, and openshift. authentication ansible container's k8s engine will provide a cli option for mounting /home/user/.kube or custom path to an existing config file. it will be up to the user to create a config file outside of ansible container.
