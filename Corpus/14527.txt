 URL : "https://github.com/lukeed/taskr/issues/301" TITLE : async await tasks BODY : raising an issue because i don't know where else could i ask this. assuming i have this taskfile.js js export default async function task { await task.clear .start 'build' ; } export async function build task { await task.parallel 'scripts', 'styles' ; await task.start 'uglify' ; } i run the build task using shell taskr build 1. how do i convert the taskfile.js to use the programmatic option? js const taskr = require 'taskr' ; const taskr = new taskr { tasks: { } } ; taskr.start 'build' ; 2. can i use functions that return a promise as taskr tasks? if so how, because i can't figure it out. for example i have a clean function: js function clean pattern, options { new promise resolve, reject => { rimraf pattern, { glob: options }, err, result => err ? reject err : resolve result ; } } this sits within its own file and is exported as such. how could i use this to define a taskr task and use it in my workflow? thank you.
