 URL : "https://github.com/HubSpot/vex/issues/203" TITLE : publish and release 3.1.0 BODY : we've just merged in a few prs and addressed the ./dist folder issue from a few previous prs. i don't have publish permissions to npm or bower. i think a github release should also be made how do i do that? . if i recall, @adamschwartz or @geekjuice did this for 3.0.0, so would you mind publishing or giving me permissions? @markstos your prepublish hook worked. grunt ran when i tried to npm publish .
