 URL : "https://github.com/slaclab/pydm/issues/196" TITLE : pydm & windows BODY : leaving here some bugs that i am addressing: - the pickle files are being converted from unix to dos during checkout at windows. this can probably be fixed with a proper .gitattributes file. - pydm launch script does not work under linux. i need to do: python scripts\pydm ... - pydm fails to open a file under windows such as: python scripts\pydm examples\home.ui . if i do: python ..\scripts\pydm home.ui from inside examples folder it works great. maybe more to come.
