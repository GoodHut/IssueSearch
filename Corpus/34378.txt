 URL : "https://github.com/aspnetboilerplate/aspnetboilerplate/issues/1992" TITLE : cascade soft deletes BODY : suppose i have the following entities with 0..1 relationships: c public class parent : entity, isoftdelete { public parent { children = new list<child> ; } public virtual ilist<child> children { get; set; } public virtual bool isdeleted { get; set; } } public class child : entity, isoftdelete { public child { grandchildren = new list<grandchild> ; } public virtual ilist<grandchild> grandchildren { get; set; } public virtual bool isdeleted { get; set; } } public class grandchild : entity, isoftdelete { public grandchild { } public virtual bool isdeleted { get; set; } } when we delete a parent entity via irespository , what is the preferred method for cascading the soft delete to all of the child and grandchild entities? similarly, if we want to delete a child entity, all of the related grandchild entities should be soft deleted as well. i'm using abp 1.4.0. i apologize if this has been asked before -- i was not able to find a similar question, examples, or documentation on this.
