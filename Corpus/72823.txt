 URL : "https://github.com/webmin/webmin/issues/660" TITLE : changelog not up to date BODY : the changelog hasn't been updated since 1.790. i know it's on the website, but it's probably misleading to have an unmaintained one in the repo. i could go through and bring the ones from the website over, but if there's an automated process for updating it that is just broken and can be fixed, i won't bother with it.
