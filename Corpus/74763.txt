 URL : "https://github.com/GoASTScanner/gas/issues/107" TITLE : file perm error for 0644 BODY : i'm getting for a main.go file when run through gometalinter: expect file permissions to be 0600 or less the perms are 0644. is this saying main.go should have 0 for group and other perms? if so, why is this so stringent? 0644 are the default perms, on macos at least, and they're perfectly fine.
