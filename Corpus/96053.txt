 URL : "https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce/issues/4059" TITLE : duplicate imports in 4.7.2 BODY : it seems that in version 4.7.2 the file size of the tinymce library has grown significantly. i noticed this when 3 of our web applications suddenly grew exactly 136 kb. when reverting to tinymce 4.7.1 our file size shrank by 136 kb. when comparing the source code i noticed how 4.7.2 added some imports to 2 different versions of the same feature. for example: 4.7.2 contains both ephox.katamari.api.arr and tinymce.core.util.arr , while 4.7.1 only contained the latter. here are some of the other imports i noticed seem to be duplicates or slightly different versions of the same thing: - ephox.katamari.api.fun and tinymce.core.util.fun - ephox.sand.api.node and tinymce.core.html.node i would like to know if my hypothesis makes sense and if it's possible the reduce the file size in future releases.
