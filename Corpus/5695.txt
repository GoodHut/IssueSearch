 URL : "https://github.com/webtorque7/inpage-modules/issues/12" TITLE : set up trouble BODY : saw this module referenced on your ss blog post and was intrigued so gave it a shot. installed via composer defaulted to dev-master and have had a bit of trouble getting things working. the docs seem a bit out of date and incomplete for first time set up? i tried filling in some gaps here and there but kept getting errors and problems. some issues: default 'contentmodules' many_many relationship appears to be expected/required by module, but is not defined in the contentmodule_pageextension extension. results in sql error when loading preview in visual editor interface and inability to add any content blocks. docs suggest you can opt in to add contentmodule_pageextension to only certain page types, but the module's config.yml actually adds it to the base page class automatically. visual editor only option for editing blocks? this is a cool feature but crashed on me with fatal error: call to a member function appendchild on null in ... /inpage-modules/code/model/contentmodule.php on line 1188 once i created my first content block. would be good to have option of a basic editing tab within regular page editing interface. looks like a really promising module but would be great to make the first-time installation a clearer and smoother experience for developers so they're more likely to hang on through setup and adopt it.
