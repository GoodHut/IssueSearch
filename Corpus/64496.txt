 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-agent/issues/1297" TITLE : git-lfs support missing BODY : agent version and platform 2.124.0 windows vsts type and version visualstudio.com what's not working? git-lfs isn't installed with the agent, so a pulling from a repository enabled with lfs fails. i had an older version of the agent running which used to work just fine with lfs, but i had to reinstall it. my builds started failing after the reinstall. i've worked around the problem by putting a copy of git-lfs into the <agent>/externals/git/cmd folder - git lfs now functions correctly.
