 URL : "https://github.com/casesandberg/react-color/issues/357" TITLE : global event listeners. BODY : we have been having a few weird interactions on an application we are working on that uses react-color. after hunting a bit, i noticed that react-color is adding event listeners on mouseup/down to the whole window and not to the component : https://github.com/casesandberg/react-color/search?utf8=%e2%9c%93&q=mouseup&type= is there a valid reason for doing this ?
