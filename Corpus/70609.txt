 URL : "https://github.com/gowww/app/issues/2" TITLE : wip ? i'd like to help! BODY : hello! i haven't landed on a web framework in go that i've liked everything about so far. each one either has some functionality that i wish it had or it has way too much functionality. i stumbled upon your router library and have messed around a little https://github.com/ijsnow/rtr with it. it was my attempt at putting together what i needed as a mini framework while i was waiting on this one! i've looked through all of the code and i think this may be the best choice for what i like in a framework. i'd love to help get it out of the wip state if you'd like some help! have anything that is outstanding that i could take a crack at?
