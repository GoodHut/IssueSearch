 URL : "https://github.com/Data4Democracy/media-crawler/issues/12" TITLE : handle tweets in articles BODY : hackathon note: this is a bit more challenging than the other parsers, and can be considered a stretch goal so tweets come in a few shapes and sizes when referenced. sometimes articles link to tweets, other times they embed them. this issue is for tracking both kinds of tweet reference: - links to tweets - embedded tweets no matter which kind you are tackling, i recommend utilizing the twitter api in this. links to tweets this can be handled very similarly to all other link references. a parser for twitter urls will just have to defined and imported into the parser_map under a suitable regex pattern to match against. from there, the twitter api can likely be your best friend. embedded tweets this will likely be the first kind of embedded reference we will handle aside from videos, so we will actually discuss that in another issue.
