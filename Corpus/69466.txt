 URL : "https://github.com/facg3/FACG3-Book/issues/17" TITLE : test folder in frontend BODY : test are made for the developers where public folder is for files that are sent to the client. also there are 2 test folders in your project each one in the folder that they are supposed to test, this way it will make it hard to run the test script because of different paths. it's better to have one folder for test that contains folders or files for each test and that folder be in the root folder.
