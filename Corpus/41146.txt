 URL : "https://github.com/LewisVo/Awesome-Linux-Software/issues/214" TITLE : wrong link for wpgtk BODY : the link for wpgtk currently given https://github.com/lewisvo/github.com/deviantfero/wpgtk https://github.com/lewisvo/github.com/deviantfero/wpgtk doesn't work as it mixes the urls of both this repository and the wpgtk one. the correct url is https://github.com/deviantfero/wpgtk https://github.com/deviantfero/wpgtk or alternatively, for a better presentation, the project's github.io homepage, http://deviantfero.github.io/wpgtk http://deviantfero.github.io/wpgtk . just thought i'd point out this small mistake so it can be fixed. thanks in advance for the understanding.
