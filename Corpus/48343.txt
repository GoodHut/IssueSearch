 URL : "https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/2867" TITLE : riot: technology used BODY : if there is a support group somewhere i should be using instead of here, please let me know as i'm a newbie. trying to wrap my head around riot and have a few questions. i have installed and used riot on windows, mac, and ios as well as used it in the browser. i have read everything i can find on it and what i am trying to understand is when i install riot myself on a server, what are the technologies used? but here is what i know so far: •	javascript es6 •	node.js for npm only i think? •	react •	matrix js sdk and react sdk •	electron wrapper for desktop apps , same as slack next step is to actually install riot and set it up which might clear it up for me. but being a web developer, it always comes down to, what is the database, application server and front end. i know the front end is react and is built upon their react sdk, but what is used for the web server and where is the data stored? i am guessing the web server is irrelevant, any can be used but the data storage confuses me. anyone who can steer me in the right direction would be appreciated. thanks much
