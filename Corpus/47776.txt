 URL : "https://github.com/yaronn/map-canvas/issues/4" TITLE : provide europe region BODY : hello, i'm interested in adding a central-ish europe region, mostly to get better granularity of the locations i'm mostly working with. i did a quick image search and came up with this image cutting off some of the large northern countries ! central europe map https://i.imgur.com/dmak48i.png and this, including all of europe please ignore the highlighting ! europe map https://i.imgur.com/6jx5ana.jpg i hope you roughly get what i mean. : both of them work better for me than the current world map. i tried to understand what's going on in the code, but my gnuplot skills are non-existent. do you have any pointers how i would generate the data that is needed for something like this? i'm not sure where to start right now :
