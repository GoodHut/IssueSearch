 URL : "https://github.com/matteocorti/check_rbl/issues/14" TITLE : suppose @inc without . BODY : perl-5.26 is going to be dropping . from @inc for security reasons the same reason you need to use ./foo to run foo from the current directory . we have a bug in gentoo for check_rbl v1.3.7: https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=625320 and a page here that explains the change: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/project:perl/dot-in-inc-removal the usual fix is simply to update your use , require , and do commands to include the dot explicitly. since perl-5.26 is now on the supported list, this will become an issue soon.
