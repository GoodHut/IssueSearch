 URL : "https://github.com/umlet/umlet/issues/445" TITLE : missing menu shortcuts. BODY : there are so many ui details that have been overlooked. the application which i only use to export files because the plugin hangs, reported in 310 and others doesn't have any shortcut combination for file | recent files . normally this would be r , that is, so i can hit alt+f, r . similarly there is no shortcut for file | export as... . don't use x , because that is used for exit . actually i just realized that none of them have shortcuts. ☹️ i would suggest looking at other applications and trying to use a convention. people have even collected lists of these conventions. i can point you to them if you can't find them.
