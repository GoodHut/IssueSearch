 URL : "https://github.com/getsentry/raven-go/issues/120" TITLE : support chained errors BODY : the full sentry api supports chained exceptions https://docs.sentry.io/clientdev/interfaces/exception/ however it appears that the go client deduplicates all interfaces based on class over here https://github.com/getsentry/raven-go/blob/master/client.go l248 would it be possible to allow a special case on interface type to send a list of errors?
