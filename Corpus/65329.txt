 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/ODBC-Specification/issues/123" TITLE : indirect column binding BODY : something i have long wanted from odbc is the ability to do indirect column binding the way oledb can with its dbtype_byref . right now odbc bindings must be 'flat', that is the memory must be present at the address calculated by adding any offset to the address passed to sqlbindcol//sqlbindparameter. it would be very useful if instead the buffer at the calculated address were itself a pointer and thus allowed structures with embedded pointers to be used when row-wise binding is in effect. it is possible to perform such indirect binding by using data-at-exec but that is a complicated process for something that could be achieved far easier by the addition of new c target type values the method i would prefer or a descriptor attribute.
