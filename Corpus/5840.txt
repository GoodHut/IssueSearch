 URL : "https://github.com/russellschmidt/climate-cents/issues/7" TITLE : test meta tags BODY : this would entail installing capybara i think or enabling view testing in rspec and then testing the methods in application_helper.rb in the now commented-out application_helper_spec.rb. bonus points for creating default values if no argument passed to these methods and then testing for this on passing nil or empty string as an argument. ideally, these defaults could be set in a central place.
