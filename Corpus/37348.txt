 URL : "https://github.com/jkenlooper/broken-clock/issues/1" TITLE : low fidelity mock up BODY : should show a clock set to a time. beneath it should be a list of entries as to why that time was chosen as the ideal time to set a broken clock to. what other views would be necessary for the site? if the entries are automatically added as embedded tweets; then is there a need to have login screens and such? maybe a _tweet this link_ would be good. the footer should probably have links back to the github project and list the contributors.
