 URL : "https://github.com/crabstudio/react-native-search-box/issues/14" TITLE : centering the placeholder BODY : so i've been playing with this library and so far is been great, the one problem that i have is that the searchbar won't have the placeholder centered if my placeholder is something like jump to a conversation and the thing is that setting the collapse and expand margins isn't the best way to go. any pointers on how to resolve it?
