 URL : "https://github.com/JohnnyCrazy/SpotifyAPI-NET/issues/178" TITLE : installing api with unity BODY : so i might just be being dumb but i am attempting to install your api in to my unity project. currently making a music visualizer and wanted to add spotify support so i could play my playlists though it . every time i attempt to install your api though vs15's nuget package installer i get an error saying the following. > could not install package 'newtonsoft.json 8.0.2'. you are trying to install this package into a project that targets '.netframework,version=v3.5,profile=unity subset v3.5' but the package does not contain any assembly references or content files that are compatible with that framework. i'm still pretty new to using outside api's with c in unity and this hasn't really happened before. is there any solution you know of? as i haven't seen anyone else even attempting to install this package in to a unity project before and it seems to be taking a problem with it.
