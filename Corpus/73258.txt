 URL : "https://github.com/apache/cordova-discuss/issues/80" TITLE : cordova and multi-window BODY : has there been any progress in finding a solution for this https://github.com/apache/cordova-discuss/blob/master/proposals/android-n-support.md multi-window support? as it has described here, the cordova activty is destroyed and restarted whenever being resized, and along with it goes the webview. my users have reported this, and since my javascript does locally store some values relating to the session and inputs, this causes some annoyance. not sure if this is the place for this or if this project is still active, but wondering if anyone has found a workaround. thanks.
