 URL : "https://github.com/boopathi/babili-webpack-plugin/issues/23" TITLE : source maps issue BODY : i used devtool: 'source-map' in webpack config and did not use babili-webpack-plugin. here are some code of my source file: var b = 1024; console.log 10 all worked great, i could set breakpoint to line: var b = 1024; and to line console.log 10 also i could see the value of b variable during debugging. but after i added babili-webpack-plugin i can not see the value of b variable. also now i can set breakpoint only to line: console.log 10 and can not set breakpoint to line: var b = 1024; is it an issue or maybe i do something wrong? here is part of my webpack.config.js const config = { devtool: 'source-map', plugins: new babiliplugin {}, { comments: false } }
