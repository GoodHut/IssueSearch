 URL : "https://github.com/pysam-developers/pysam/issues/528" TITLE : feature request mean_baq BODY : any interest / thoughts in a mean_baq function? the idea would be per base pair to, well, compute the average baq. it'd be really useful for my workflow at least. i'd imagine that one could gently modify the count_coverage function to implement this quickly. please let me know if there's a straightforward way that i'm missing to do this with the existing functionality. thanks!
