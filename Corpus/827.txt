 URL : "https://github.com/romanz/trezor-agent/issues/114" TITLE : rsa keys ? BODY : hi ! i use my ledger nano s for ssh authentication. it perfectly works with all of my servers, but not with cisco routers since they expect only rsa keys. i can see that ledger sdk support rsa, but the ssh/pgp app only propose to generate ed25519 or nist256p1 keys. any idea on how can i generate rsa keys for cisco's sshd ? regards
