 URL : "https://github.com/apache/trafficserver/issues/2250" TITLE : ipmap drops ip ranges BODY : i expect to add any number of ip ranges to an ipmap. i have found a test case where it fails to do this. see this branch https://github.com/lbordowitz/trafficserver/tree/afb32920a451419cd4ec023bfbbeda7b3d86fe4d , and run make check in the lib/ts directory to run the ipmaptest. the last test, ipmap_closeintersection , adds 13 ranges and expects them to all be there, but only 8 ranges are in the map.
