 URL : "https://github.com/YaleDHLab/ensemble-at-yale/issues/126" TITLE : final pdf image load BODY : some of these might already be accomplished, but just to lay them out: 1 upload pdf pages to s3: https://yale.box.com/s/hb24wollhna2c6oq5mbw7fxv34t3hr5s 2 upload pdf thumbnails to s3: https://yale.box.com/s/0uv5a78ue2naei8hmy6n45qyncdwlpo4 3 ingest the new pdf programs: https://github.com/yaledhlab/ensemble-at-yale/blob/master/project/ensemble-at-yale/subjects/group_james_bundy_pdf.csv hopefully i formatted that csv file for easy ingestion. . i've given it a different name from the scanned bundy material, in case it makes it easier to ingest cleanly. but all the items in it share the james_bundy group key.
