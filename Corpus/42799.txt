 URL : "https://github.com/northwest-knowledge-network/mdedit/issues/153" TITLE : can't delete contacts BODY : on the contacts tab, there is no way to delete existing authors or data access contacts. this is especially evident if you accidentally click either 'add an author' or 'add an access contact' and then go to another tab; when you return to contacts, you will have a blank contact record that the 'cancel x add' button cannot remove. maybe instead of a single cancel button, put an x button on each contact that will remove it from the record?
