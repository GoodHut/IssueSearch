 URL : "https://github.com/Rennzie/tea-cozy/issues/1" TITLE : override body margin BODY : on most browsers, body has an automatic margin applied to it in chrome's case it's 8px . this means there's always a small buffer around your page. this is often done by using a reset.css file, but if not using that then it's always good to explicitly set it yourself so, we can solve this with this style: body { margin: 0; } https://github.com/rennzie/tea-cozy/blob/master/resources/css/style.css l1-l7
