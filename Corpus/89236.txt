BODY : what you were trying to do setting the latest dev build up and play to see what's been up. what actually happened i have a dedicated gpu nvidia geforce and an integrated intel hd 530. but when i run the game, the logs return these following lines complete logs attached below : <br> ... 13:39:05.764 main info o.t.rendering.shadermanagerlwjgl - loading terasology shader manager... 13:39:05.764 main info o.t.rendering.shadermanagerlwjgl - lwjgl: 2.9.3 / windows 13:39:05.764 main info o.t.rendering.shadermanagerlwjgl - gl_vendor: intel 13:39:05.764 main info o.t.rendering.shadermanagerlwjgl - gl_renderer: intel r hd graphics 530 13:39:05.764 main info o.t.rendering.shadermanagerlwjgl - gl_version: 4.4.0 - build 21.20.16.4550 13:39:05.764 main info o.t.rendering.shadermanagerlwjgl - shading_language version: 4.40 - build 21.20.16.4550 ... on checking my task manager, the game was in fact running on my integrated gpu which btw isn't too powerful, hence, bad performance <30fps since i used a machine with an igpu till last year, i don't really know if the problem is an old one. i even tried installing the stable release and forcing the executable to run using the nvidia processor, but it didn't change anything at all. how to reproduce just ran the game log details and game version latest source on the develop branch 2017-12-08_13-39-02.zip https://github.com/movingblocks/terasology/files/1541955/2017-12-08_13-39-02.zip computer details ram: 8gb gpu: nvidia geforce gtx 960m cpu: intel core i7-6700hq java version: 1.8.0_65
