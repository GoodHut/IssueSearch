 URL : "https://github.com/ppwwyyxx/tensorpack/issues/523" TITLE : atari roms broken? BODY : i downloaded rom file for ms_pacman from the url mentioned here: https://github.com/ppwwyyxx/tensorpack/blob/130f60ac4491d55a13632eabbad839c2e23138ba/examples/deepqnetwork/atari.py l25 this prints errors like illegal instruction! 32 at line 91 same file and does not render anything. but strangely gym.make 'mspacman-v0' works. so i looked at the atari_py repo and saw that the roms have not been updated in 2 years. tl;dr: the roms on the github repo seem to be broken for a few games. roms present locally at '/site-packages/atari_py/atari_roms' are working at the moment. you might want to update the debug message to download from the url to something else. thanks
