 URL : "https://github.com/eclipse/n4js/issues/59" TITLE : update unicode support BODY : java8 ships with a new version of the unicode standard. when i regenerate the unicode.xtext, i see changes compared to the currently used version. - does js specify the unicode version, that it's supposed to be compatible to? - should we migrate to jflex which is a lexer with native support for unicode character classes?
