BODY : hi, i have upgraded my raspberry pi 3 running raspbian to debian 9 / stretch. that combination is not mentioned on https://www.lesbonscomptes.com/upmpdcli/downloads.html debian. running the raspbian jessie version results in an immediate segfault. i haven't saved the strace, if you're interested in it i could install that version again to report it to you. but i don't think we should care about that crash. so i changed /etc/apt/sources.list.d/upmpdcli.list to the debian stretch setting and build the package according to https://www.lesbonscomptes.com/upmpdcli/upmpdcli-debian-build.txt. i couldn't install the mentioned hardening-wrapper package and had to install dh-systemd , but besides that everything seems to work perfectly. now to my question: do you plan to provide binary packages also for raspbian stretch? i think more people will be interested in them once the first official raspbian image with stretch is released might take some time though .
