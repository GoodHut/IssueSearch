 URL : "https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/issues/1290" TITLE : query tag helper BODY : there's a liquid template for queries, but there's no razor tag helper equivalent. suggest adding like so: to render all items returned in the query summary display type by default, but can be changed by supplying the display type attribute <query name= xyz display-type= /> to render all items returned in the query with optional markup before and after the list of items <query name= xyz > <!-- markup before --> <items /> <!-- markup after--> </query>
