 URL : "https://github.com/expede/inspector_gadget/issues/1" TITLE : inspect_flow rename BODY : perhaps inspect_flow should be renamed since it does not inspect elixir flow calls but rather designed for a piped-in style? i'd probably recommend inspect_here or so? also, while at it, is there a need to override the pipe? or is that just for the use of watching an entire module? you can actually make a custom command say, inspect_all that is a macro and receives the entire pipe as an ast then prints out the values at each pipe step. this is how the library ok_jose https://github.com/vic/ok_jose works for example, you just add a |> ok to the end of the pipe and it transforms the entire pipe to accepting or passing through {:ok, value} tuples. that way you can inspect the entire path of a single piping path without needing to override the pipe in an entire area though keeping that as an option would be useful for bulk-debugging . :-
