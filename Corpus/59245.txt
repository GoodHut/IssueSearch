 URL : "https://github.com/arthurdejong/python-stdnum/issues/46" TITLE : tin number from monaco BODY : hello, we are facing an issue with the validation of the following tin numbers: fr40000066034, fr26000040583, fr28000113851 more to be found at http://www.monaco-directory.com/ ... the number starts with fr, but is for a company in monaco. you might already know the monaco uses the french tin structure. note that this number is valid according to vies: http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/ however, the 9 last digits siren number in france do not pass the luhn validity check. there doesn't seem to be any issue with the algorithm implemented in stdnum, since other external services don't validate this number either. at this point, we couldn't find any resource specifying that this number should not verify the luhn algorithm, the only known exception being la poste https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/formule_de_luhn cas_particulier . however, my hypothesis is that it is not the case for monaco at least for recent numbers . have you heard about this issue before? thanks
