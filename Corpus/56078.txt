 URL : "https://github.com/Dragonol/prj-rev-bwfs-dasmoto/issues/5" TITLE : meaningful class names BODY : does this class name carry any meaning? is there any reason you would want to use .h2 instead of h2 ? what do you gain out of doing so? https://github.com/dragonol/prj-rev-bwfs-dasmoto/blob/1d99fb1c894e99a1c4f3738f850a110ff2850d62/finaltest4/index.html l19 when you are creating classes, it should be clear what their intent is. if you give the classes cryptic names, then you aren't helping other developers understand what's happening and you also aren't making your life easier if you need to maintain the code later on.
