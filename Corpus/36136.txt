 URL : "https://github.com/SchoolofComputerScience/scs-issues/issues/29" TITLE : general and homepage BODY : - conform to cmu standards for type and color - background image looks too playful to be the brand - what is rationale for the order that individual units are presented on the hp? maybe use alphabetical order? - grid has three columns, then changes to two lower down on the page: visually awkward - too many submenu items at top. break into two groups or merge to fewer categories. test with card sorts. - on long scrolling pages, type hierarchy is strange. consider adding color - i have concerns about creating open code in github for all of scs to maintain
