 URL : "https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy/issues/1570" TITLE : bug ? in load_data BODY : i am loading eds data with load_data . if i read the data as a tuple a, b = hs.load 1.msa , 2.msa , signal_type='eds_tem' the data are correctly loaded independent of whether they have the same shape or the same calibration. if i load them as a stack s = hs.load 1.msa , 2.msa , signal_type='eds_tem', stack=true i do get an error cannot broadcast , which is correct, if they do not have the same shape. if the data have the same shape same number of channels but are differently calibrated different values of offset , scale , and units the data are read without problems but the calibration of the first spectrum read is silently applied to all subsequently read spectra. we should probably issue an error too in this case.
