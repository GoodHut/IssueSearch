 URL : "https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer3/issues/3654" TITLE : multiple application users BODY : hi, thanks for a product that's both technically informed and easy to pick up. i have a requirement to have database driven users and also the resources apis they are entitled to use. i've followed the entity framework sample to create the identity server tables and also the aspnet identity sample to hook into that and now have a database containing both identity server and aspnet identity tables. my question is how should i set up users/clients/scopes in such a way that a single user can have access to one/many apis secured by identity server? there doesn't seem to be a relationship between users and applications in identity server to determine which user can access which api?
