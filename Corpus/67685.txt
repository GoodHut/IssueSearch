 URL : "https://github.com/lgolding/issue-copy-test/issues/1" TITLE : provide suggested fixes BODY : copied from https://github.com/sarif-standard/sarif-spec/issues/1, created by @lgolding: suggestion from collin winter: some analysis tools can not only flag issues, but also suggest potential fixes, which can then be applied by the ide/code review/code browsing/etc tools. in google's _tricorder_, this is represented as a fix object, attached to the equivalent of the sarif issue object; each fix has a human-readable description and a non-empty list of replacement objects, which simply replace a byte range with some new list of bytes.
