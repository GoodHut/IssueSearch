 URL : "https://github.com/jscrambler/atom-jscrambler/issues/5" TITLE : is this even active? BODY : i see mult open issues dating back years and nobody can even install and activate this package i'm only opening this issue to as that in the spirit of at least trying to help keep the atom repo clean, if you would just go ahead and remove this to save those of us that spend our time searching for a package, go through all the time to then install it, just to find it does not even work at all.
