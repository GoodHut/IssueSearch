 URL : "https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/issues/347" TITLE : vuetify & vuex BODY : first of all, thanks for this awesome package! a question i'm having is: what is the proper way to use vuetify in combination with vuex? for example, how to use v-model alerts or snackbars with data received from a vuex store? because when closing an alert, or when a toast times out, it tries to directly modify the object received from the vuex store, and this is not allowed vuex strict mode : error: vuex do not mutate vuex store state outside mutation handlers. also, when i try to do something like this: v-model= toast , where toast is an object like this in the store: { msg: 'this is the toast', timeout: 1000} , i'm getting the following error: invalid prop: type check failed for prop value . my workaround for how is to add an extra property show: true to the toast object. but perhaps there is a better way. any tips?
