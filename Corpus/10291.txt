 URL : "https://github.com/SQLab/symgdb/issues/1" TITLE : build failed ... BODY : hi i was trying to build the symgdb, but it failed. it seems the reason is the triton source is not as expected as you use. src/libtriton/cmakefiles/gen-syscall64.dir/build.make:61: recipe for target 'src/libtriton/os/unix/syscalls64.cpp' failed i didn't find this syscalls64.cpp instead have found syscallnumbertostring.cpp there in latest version.
