 URL : "https://github.com/MantaRayMedia/alnap/issues/339" TITLE : uploading profile pics BODY : there seems to be an issue with uploading profile pics. when i reset my password it it wouldnt let me upload a profile photo. less urgent but just fyi. i selected the file, click upload, it refreshes, but then nothing happened and the file name disappears and nothing is uploaded. i gave up but now can't find anywhere to try again – the upload picture option isn’t in ‘edit my details’. just flagging in case you're not already aware
