 URL : "https://github.com/mediamonks/drupal-controller-annotations/issues/1" TITLE : requires php 7? BODY : hi, when trying to run composer require drupal/controller_annotations , it says: > your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages. > > problem 1 > - symfony/framework-bundle 4.0.x-dev requires php ^7.1.3 -> your php version 5.6.31 does not satisfy that requirement. > - conclusion: remove phpdocumentor/reflection-docblock 2.0.5 > - conclusion: don't install phpdocumentor/reflection-docblock 2.0.5 > .. it goes on from there, trying to somehow make it work. so my question is, is it currently possible to install this on php 5.6? i currently still have drupal 7 sites which i do not want to take the trouble of making them compliant with php 7. this is why i am still on php 5.6. maybe i should use docker.. just did not take the time yet to make myself familiar with it and make it work on my system.
