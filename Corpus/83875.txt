 URL : "https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/issues/1461" TITLE : common test utils project BODY : spawned from 1442. we had to jump through a couple of gradle hoops to get test class dependencies working properly. furthermore, some of our test classes have functionality that can be useful in general e.g. temporaryconfigurationholder , toggleableexceptionproxy . a nice way of handling this could be to have a project that contains these general test classes.
