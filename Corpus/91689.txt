 URL : "https://github.com/dannagle/PacketSender/issues/87" TITLE : unhandled win32 exception BODY : an unhandled win32 exception is thrown while using smart responses with persistent tcp enabled causing packetsender.exe to crash. i am using a smart response with the following parameters: if packet data equals 05 00 reply with 06 00 with hex encoding i receive three tcp packets with the content 05 00 on separate connections at 1 second intervals, the sender closes the socket immediately after sending the packet. packet sender shows 05 00 being received and 06 00 being sent in the log and opens a persistent tcp window. after 1 second another persistent tcp window is opened and packet sender may or may not show 05 00 being received and 06 00 being sent. packet sender then crashes. the 06 00 that shows as being sent from packet sender is never received by the sender of 05 00 . visual studio jit debugger describes the bug as an unhandled win32 exception occurred in packetsender.exe 111132 . replicating this process without smart responses by manually sending the 06 00 response works fine.
