 URL : "https://github.com/bluemixgaragelondon/cf-blue-green-deploy/issues/37" TITLE : support -p push parameter BODY : this plugin is exactly what i've been looking for, but i'm deploying a java application that's packaged into an executable jar. specifying the path in a manifest file isn't simple, because the manifest expects a literal filename and can't glob or substitute placeholders, and bgd doesn't support the -p to specify _what_ to push. with a regular cf push , i can cf p app -p target/app- .jar .
