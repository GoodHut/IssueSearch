 URL : "https://github.com/Flinesoft/CSVImporter/issues/20" TITLE : swift 3.1 compile errors BODY : admitted novice here. i've been using csvimporter in my project for a while now without issue. tried to make a new build today and ran into the following error: module compiled with swift 3.0.2 cannot be imported in swift 3.1 for the line: import csvimporter so i re-downloaded the csvimporter as well as handyswift, opened the .xcworkspace in xcode, and made new frameworks. i replaced the old frameworks in my project with the new ones and this fixed the previous error but introduced new ones: cannot specialize non-generic type 'module<csvimporter' use of undeclared type 'csvimporter' for the line: var fileurlimporter = csvimporter< string: string > url: destinationfileurl this now seems to be well above my head. is this a problem with the csvimporter code, or is this my issue? any guidance would be appreciated.
