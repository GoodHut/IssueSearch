 URL : "https://github.com/obarthel/amiga-smbfs/issues/2" TITLE : netbios name limitation BODY : smbfs 1.106 17.04.2016 right now, the netbios name length is limited to 16 chars. if i choose a name longer than this for the computer i'm actually working from i won't be able to access any servers. instead it gives me an error message. normally the system i'm on would be named aeon-amigaonex1000-computer . using this i am not able to connect to my nas, reducing the name to simply amigax1000 works if possible, please raise this limitation. linux and windows platforms can work with any name given without the limitation. but maybe i'm mixing some things up here. please raise the netbios name length limitation to atleast 32, if possible
