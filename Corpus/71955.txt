 URL : "https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-android/issues/1493" TITLE : app sharing via facebook BODY : actual behaviour toast saying please retry again is raised when i try to share the app using invite via facebook button. on the other hand, i am able to share the app successfully via facebook using share app button and then selecting share with facebook . expected behaviour i think there is no need for a separate button to enable facebook sharing. moreover, it is not even functional. screenshots of the issue ! device-2017-05-06-170435 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21010060/25772023/771b6a8c-327e-11e7-9345-453a04f2de73.png ! device-2017-05-06-170458 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21010060/25772037/17c0778e-327f-11e7-8fd8-bd55c11b8f76.png would you like to work on the issue? yes. ----- @the-dagger @mariobehling @mananwason is this intended?
