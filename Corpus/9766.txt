 URL : "https://github.com/GoogleChrome/confluence/issues/40" TITLE : add deep linking BODY : all app states should be linkable. this means that we would have different urls possibly just a different anchor/fragment for: - api catalog and custom views spawned by analysis - page number - expand all state - search query - currently selected browsers - analysis - currently selected view - state for custom views this may prove to be too much state. perhaps we want the ability to generate a link for api-catalog-style views, and current app state on the current machine could go in indexeddb or similar so that custom views aren't lost on a single client.
