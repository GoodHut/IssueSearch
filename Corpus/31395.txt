 URL : "https://github.com/psifidotos/Latte-Dock/issues/817" TITLE : shadow effect clips BODY : if the shadow effect size is too big it will clip off alpha/mask from the dock/panel area. this is not an issue when interacting with the dock where the shadows draw correctly. in idle they will clip again. side note, since the settings dialog doesn't appear to be the usual pop up window dialog for settings, and the extra visual changes it applies, it's kind of difficult to tweak settings like shadow and know what they look like without closing the settings window.
