 URL : "https://github.com/modoboa/modoboa-webmail/issues/82" TITLE : inbox unread count BODY : the unread message count on the sidebar seems to be easily confused. the mailbox i set up for testing is consistently showing 1 when the mailbox is empty. is there any way to manually set the count to zero? i had a look at the postgres modoboa tables but could not find anything obvious.
