 URL : "https://github.com/esdoc/esdoc/issues/474" TITLE : raw documentation as json BODY : i'm sorry for obvious question but i'm bad at research. so is there way to get row json data of docs so that i choose how to show it? what i'm saying is that i need flexibility, of how docs are presented i'm not talking about styling : - how are they broken down and combined in project structure, suppose i want to decide module structure. - so on. if it is it should probably have specific format, and if its update in newer releases i need to keep up with it so that my docs does not break. do you provide standard of that ?
