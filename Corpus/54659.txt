 URL : "https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer/issues/249" TITLE : handle crashing better BODY : can we do the same mechanism like claymore, ethminer should support a option like -r reboot , in case there is something wrong during mining and can lead the app crashing, gpu stopped: - if user configured option -r, if something crash ethminer should look for another .bat file to run - the user will configure the reboot.bat which is same folder , used to reboot machine in case app crashed. this would be helpful because we can configure to bootstrap ethiminer when pc rebooted. it means the app never stop for a while and better monitoring, if crashing happened, pc will auto reboot and re-run eth again. thanks.
