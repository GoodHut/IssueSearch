 URL : "https://github.com/csrdelft/orm/issues/4" TITLE : default database value BODY : it is currently not possible to set a default value for a column in the database. there is a check in place in https://github.com/csrdelft/orm/blob/master/src/persistence/databaseadmin.php l159 which checks the database for the default value. the default value is always null according to the orm. persistentattribute already has some logic for supporting default values, reading from the class is not available yet.
