 URL : "https://github.com/sellout/external-program/issues/37" TITLE : support for pty BODY : sbcl has a :pty keyword for run-program, which make it possible to talk to other repl like program possible, for example, python, psql, sqlite, etc. although it's not in ccl and ecl, but maybe possible implement in a similar way by calling c functions fork , execvp like sbcl does. i think it's a useful feature. it's of course possible to use these interpreter's low level c library, but need a lot of effort, like library rcl, ltk . talk to interpreter to directly is a less efficient but quick way. is this task possible run a external python, talk to it interactively in cl in current external-program in current external-program? thank you
