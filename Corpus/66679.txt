 URL : "https://github.com/AMReX-Astro/Castro/issues/158" TITLE : new directory structure BODY : it's time to further separate code into directories by topic. this will make it easier to merge the nyx mhd into castro. some thoughts: we should no longer have separate src_1d , src_2d , src_3d , and src_nd directories. since we are removing much of the dimensional dependence from the code, this sort of distinction will soon not be necessary organization proposal: castro/source/ diffusion/ driver/ gravity/ hydro/ mhd/ radiation/ reactions/ source_terms/
