 URL : "https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc/issues/2140" TITLE : spell check in markdown BODY : markdown documents in cocalc do trigger the local browser spell checking function. misspelled words are underlined tested in firefox and chromium . however, the usual mechanism of then being able to see suggested words with a right click appears to be disables/non-functioning. this would be useful to re-enable if possible.
