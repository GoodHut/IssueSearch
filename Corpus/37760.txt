 URL : "https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Klooni1010/issues/25" TITLE : more magnetic pieces BODY : some touch screen are not very good or too old and it's not allways easy to add pieces at the right place. for example i often lose a few seconds because the game refuse the piece which is not exactly upon the right background. the pieces could be more easily added at the right place with some magnetic feature. dropping the pieces near the grid should be enough. this can be default or an option.
