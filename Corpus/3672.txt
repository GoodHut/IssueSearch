 URL : "https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/4743" TITLE : tags in cards BODY : research enter an x character to confirm the points below: x i have read the support page https://ankidroid.org/docs/help.html and am reporting a bug or enhancement request specific to ankidroid x i have checked the manual https://ankidroid.org/docs/manual.html and the faq https://github.com/ankidroid/anki-android/wiki/faq and could not find a solution to my issue x i have searched for similar existing issues here and on the user forum would it be possible to have tags all, or specific ones show somehow in cards? mainly, i'd love anki to tell me when the card i'm studying is a leech, so to be able to maybe be a more conservative with those cards. i know i can select to see just leech cards, but i'd like to be able to have some highlight on that regard also during normal study.
