 URL : "https://github.com/DSchau/blog/issues/5" TITLE : graphql query failure BODY : hey dustin! first off, wanted to thank you for taking the time to write your blog post on getting a gatsby blog setup. it was helpful to have some sort of path to creating something working. got a question for you though: js query blogpostbypath $path: string! { ... } when i put this query inside the graphql debugger, it was returning an error for me because it couldn't find $path. however, when i removed the ! it worked. could you explain why there is a ! there?
