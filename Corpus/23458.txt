 URL : "https://github.com/rootfs/node-fencing/issues/12" TITLE : poc for node-fence BODY : - simple controller doesn't work yet with workqueue - initialize new crd for fence objects with status field - polling nodefence object and start executions - execution parse the configuration for node, and start running isolation phase methods under demo directory we have: - templates-fenceconfigs.yaml which includes configmaps for all fence method templates in cluster. - demo-host0-fenceconfigs which includes fence configuration for node name lago-kube-host0 running that and killing kubelet service in node lago-kube-host0 will trigger the controller to create nodefence object in the format yaml apiversion: ha.k8s.io/v1 clean_resources: true hostname: dhcp-1-42.tlv.redhat.com <-- here we update where execution ran should modified to node name kind: nodefence node: lago-kube-host0 status: error <-- this is updated by controller after getting execution output step: power-management
