 URL : "https://github.com/sinchang/sublog/issues/2" TITLE : more friendly router path BODY : now, the app seems no proper router path for page count. hope it can be improved. btw, adding the feature of ssr server side rendering is very attractive, is there any possible plan? using nuxt.js to do ssr looks not very hard. i'm developing a react version of this, using next.js to ssr, that's very interesting.
