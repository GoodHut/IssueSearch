 URL : "https://github.com/Scratchcat1/AATC/issues/22" TITLE : password hashing security BODY : https://github.com/scratchcat1/aatc/blob/63f0e68253e8ce5db5173d16c6d89cde84922bc2/aatc_db.py l19-l20 passwords are currently only hashed once with sha256 and do not include a salt. switching to pbkdf2 or a similar password hashing function with an appropriate number of iterations as well as including a salt specific to a single user such as adding the username would improve the security of stored keys.
