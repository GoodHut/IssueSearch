 URL : "https://github.com/dgets/DANT2a/issues/20" TITLE : implement saving lists BODY : due to the fact that testing is now taking place on active running a/t/r, it'd be a damn good idea to have the ability to save them. adding a new a/t/r entry every time the least restart of the code is required gets old pretty quick. this will greatly expedite testing and should be the highest priority right now.
