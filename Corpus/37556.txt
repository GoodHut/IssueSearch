 URL : "https://github.com/dasoho/fernotron-control/issues/3" TITLE : message length issue BODY : hi, i tied to implement your code with the recommendend devices on my rasperry fhem setup. so far so good. but when i sniff the remote with the sniffer it returns the message that the code received is only 277 long instead of the expected 280. i tried to find a solution in the code but it seems that i miss context from fernotron to be able to fix it. any advice?
