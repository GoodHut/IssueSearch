 URL : "https://github.com/stratisproject/StratisBitcoinFullNode/issues/721" TITLE : node refactor BODY : this is to discuss how to refactor node. currently node when created there is an internal nodeconnection that creates two threads one that listens to incoming messages and one that sends messages to peers. i suggest we change that to use the asyncloop and use the away on incoming and outgoing messages. basically making node async. there are methods in node that are not used bu the fullnode that can also e removed. i would also propose to replace the event system of behaviours to us rx signals.
