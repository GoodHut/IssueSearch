 URL : "https://github.com/psequel/psequel/issues/149" TITLE : open multiple connections BODY : it would be good to be able to open multiple connections like sequel pro for mysql, for now if i want to connect to another db, i have to quit existing one and open a new one for the new db connection. is there anything i am missing here? or the functionality may has been provided, but i just didn't find it? thanks. it is a great tool.
