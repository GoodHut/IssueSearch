 URL : "https://github.com/SpiderStrategies/node-gmail-api/issues/30" TITLE : closing the stream BODY : this may relate to my inexperience with streams, but i would expect the my simple test app to terminate after consuming the finish stream event? i know i can call process.exit, but the fact that it doesn't exit concerns me that some resource request socket? is being left open and could accumulate/leak on subsequent calls? let gmail = new gmail access_token ; let stream = gmail.messages 'label:inbox', { max: 10, fields: 'id', 'labelids', 'snippet' } ; stream.on 'data', message => { console.log json.stringify data ; } ; stream.on 'finish', => { console.error ' process stays running ' ; } ; i see the retrieve method calls combined.end so i can't figure out why the process doesn't exit after the stream is closed.
