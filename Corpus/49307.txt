 URL : "https://github.com/openvenues/jpostal/issues/20" TITLE : tests failing to link BODY : when i run the tests using ./gradle check or as a unit test in intellij i get: java.lang.unsatisfiedlinkerror: /home/<>/jpostal/src/main/jnilibs/libjpostal_expander.so.0.0.0: libpostal.so.1: cannot open shared object file: no such file or directory the files are there and libpostal works. so far i've tried cleaning out and reinstalling the libpostal libraries, explicitly pointing to /usr/local/lib , and a few other things but no hints as to why it's not being found. building on linux btw.
