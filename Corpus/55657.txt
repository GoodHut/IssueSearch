 URL : "https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kobo-docker/issues/154" TITLE : kpi page does not load BODY : i just started with a fresh install of ubuntu and running kobo-docker. the installation is successful and after logging in and uploading my form in the form builder. the project list and project detail pages do not load it is just showing the loader. upon closer inspection from the network tool, the url: <myurl>/assets/?q=asset_type%3asurvey&limit=200 seems to be throwing 500 internal server error. i have tried this with multiple forms and in different machines and it is still showing the same error. the closest other issue i found was https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kobo-docker/issues/117 but the solution mentioned there also didn't work. not sure if it is only for me, but i have tried multiple times but still showing the same error. any help would be highly appreciated.
