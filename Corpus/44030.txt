 URL : "https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/issues/5956" TITLE : dracut mounting wrong BODY : if i have a layout with /var and/or /root in their own partition, then the mounting scheme in dracut with zpool import -n and subsequent zfs mount fails, because between the import and the mounting, /var and /root are created and filled with files and/or directories. when it comes to mounting the partitions mentioned in the pool, /var and /root fail to mount because they aren't empty. i consider overlaying a poor solution to this. and avoiding to put /var and /root in a separate partition is no solution either. the question is, why has the importing and mounting to be this way? why not just zpool import rpool without -n ? if i have a monolithic file system only one partition with everything under it , then there is no point of importing and mounting separately. so why zpool import -n ?
