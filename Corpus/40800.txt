 URL : "https://github.com/phoenixwong/vue2-timepicker/issues/27" TITLE : v-model not updating BODY : here's my code: <vue-timepicker v-model= neweventstarttime format= hh:mm :minute-interval= 30 hide-clear-button></vue-timepicker> data: function { return { neweventstarttime: { hh: '09', mm: '00', ss: '00' } } }, i'm watching the neweventstarttime object and whenever i click on a different time than the one initially set nothing changes. the ui shows the new timestamp, but i need to store it in neweventstarttime so i can append the timeframe to a date. what am i doing wrong? paging @xxrockonxx as he seems to be on top of the repo now.
