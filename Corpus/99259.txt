BODY : i found this theme from reddit, and i freaking love it, the only problem i found with it is that the menus all of them have compact design, they all seems to be squished together. example: help menu: before https://image.prntscr.com/image/xc2ke-9kqeywml_e6imfca.png | after https://image.prntscr.com/image/ht_smqwgq1_l1xiawe667w.png context menu: before https://image.prntscr.com/image/ujqzwpzrq8_tg2idtograa.png | after https://image.prntscr.com/image/tamundovthi3s42ad3p1hg.png is there something i could change in the css files to fix this? thank you for creating this awesome theme +1
