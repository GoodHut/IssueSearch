 URL : "https://github.com/arttus/devshop/issues/1" TITLE : flexible files directory BODY : this has crossed my mind a few times, so just thinking outloud here. when moving from dev environment into production where typically the files directory is set to the default, we always have to go back and change the files directory settings. how about a checkbox for default files location in environment settings. devshop could create a symlink to default files directory in the root of project folder outside of the environments and assign the proper permissions.
