 URL : "https://github.com/shagu/pfUI/issues/331" TITLE : logic error in skin.lua BODY : while investigating some 3rd party issues eqcompare and similar addons tooltips i came upon these 2 lines in skin.lua skin.lua:70 https://github.com/shagu/pfui/blob/10fdf161984b4b4ec99f4c6265b8663a7a0a9521/modules/skin.lua l70 and skin.lua:77 https://github.com/shagu/pfui/blob/10fdf161984b4b4ec99f4c6265b8663a7a0a9521/modules/skin.lua l77 both suffer the same problem. lua if not d or d == 0 then d = border 2 +d+1 end will give an attempt to perform arithmetic with nil if the if not d part is ever true. easy fix is to make it lua if not d or d == 0 then d = border 2 +1 end ps. _it didn't solve the custom shopping tooltip problems i had, that requires further modifications to pfui or eqcompare... but that's a dead addon but that line would error regardless third-party addons if d was ever nil._
