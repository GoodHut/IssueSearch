 URL : "https://github.com/berkmancenter/mediacloud/issues/214" TITLE : search for media by url BODY : via @colcarroll on https://github.com/mitmedialab/mediacloud-api-client/issues/44 right now calls to media/list with a name param only match name, not url. did it always work like that? this makes the user experience of going to source manager and searching for something like nytimes.com pretty crappy. can the name param match name and url? or can you add a param to do that? we must have the code to do this, because calls to media/create do the equivalent of this to return a canonical media_id for a url if it is in our system already.
