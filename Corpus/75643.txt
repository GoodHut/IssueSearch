 URL : "https://github.com/combust/mleap/issues/303" TITLE : how to use mleap runtime BODY : in my view as a newcomer to spark etc., the mleap documentation is currently inadequate in describing what is needed to prepare for sending requests - once the zip bundle has been posted to the server. i have successfully trained a naive bayes model on a small data file containing categorical columns, saved it using serializetobundle, and posted the bundle to the server. for a request to be sent say, using curl as per your example , surely the features vector needs to be submitted in the json request! so where and how is this formulated? in your airbnb example, the json request includes string-valued columns - and no features vector. how so? i find this confusing. can you point me to step-by-step help to get a test going? what's the best way to do this? colin goldberg
