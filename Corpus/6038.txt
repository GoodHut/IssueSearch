 URL : "https://github.com/mozilla/fathom/issues/63" TITLE : use for ebooks BODY : is it possible to use this for epub files? the epub format is a subset of xhtml, zipped and with a bit of metadata thrown in. i am trying to strip out unnecessary content e.g. copyright pages, content pages etc. for conversion of ebooks to audiobooks where such pages are redundant , is this a suitable use case?
