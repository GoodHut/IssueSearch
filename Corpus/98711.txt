 URL : "https://github.com/cmangos/classic-db/issues/44" TITLE : king of the foulweald 6621 BODY : in this quest many furbolgs spawn and attack a banner the player places down on a hill in ashenvale. currently the banner item given to the player summons the banner go and triggers the db_script stuff that summons the furbolgs on delays, but they only stand where the appear and there's nothing for them to run up to and attack. this quest should be a very difficult one but instead it is rather trivial because you can ignore almost all of the furbolgs that spawn. with no way to have the furbolgs attack gos i don't see a way to make this work without a hacky work around. any ideas? quest: 6621 banner item: 16972 spell: 20737 dbscripts entry: 6721
