 URL : "https://github.com/paypal/glamorous/issues/288" TITLE : memory leak in typings BODY : - glamorous version: 4.1.2 - glamor version: 2.20.40 - react version: 16 relevant code. javascript what you did: i used glamorous with typescript and the more components i added to the project the slower it got until i reached the fatal error: call_and_retry_last allocation failed - javascript heap out of memory what happened: the typescript compiler got stuck in a loop reproduction: unfortunately the reproduction is not trivial, but i think any larger project using typescript and glamorous will run into this -- paste your link here -- problem description: the cssproperties and svgproperties types both are declared with the helper type typescript export type singleorarray<properties, t extends keyof properties> = { p in t : properties p | array<properties p > } from https://github.com/paypal/glamorous/blob/master/typings/helpers.d.ts this causes some kind of infinite loop eating up huge amounts of memory. suggested solution: for me the fix was to remove this helper, but it was just merged with https://github.com/paypal/glamorous/pull/260 so perhaps @luke-john
