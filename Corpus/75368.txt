 URL : "https://github.com/d2phap/ImageGlass/issues/234" TITLE : handle windows shortcuts BODY : just like the default image viewer in windows 7, i would like imageglass to recognize shortcuts to pictures in the current folder. the reason is that i have many folders from deviantart images i like, and i make the folders by artist, but sometimes i make folders about a single topic and shortcut images from the artists there.
