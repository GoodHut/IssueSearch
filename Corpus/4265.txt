 URL : "https://github.com/feross/webtorrent-desktop/issues/1142" TITLE : bind ip & port BODY : what version of webtorrent desktop? see the 'about webtorrent' menu webtorrent desktop 0.18.0 linux what operating system and version? debian 8 jessie with xfce what did you do? seed torrents. what did you expect to happen? webtorrent bind to ipv4 address for incoming connections what actually happened? netstat -pln | grep listen show the line tcp6 0 0 :::50634 ::: listen 1280/webtorrent --t but not any 'tcp' ipv4 bind. seem listening only over ipv6 on a machine without ipv6. ipv6 it's also disabled cat /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/disable_ipv6 return 1 and there isn't any interface with ipv6 in ifconfig. there isn't any configuration file or command-line params where i can force ipv4 bind and maybe a fixed port? thanks.
