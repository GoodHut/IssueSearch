 URL : "https://github.com/insanum/sncli/issues/54" TITLE : issue with + sign BODY : hi there, loving sncli but facing an issue: it seems as least the + sign is escaped/replaced by a blank space when sending to sn. to reproduce: - create a new note in sncli with a + sign - synch - check the note from another sn client or the sn web interface notes created from other clients or from the sn web interface keep the + sign. this makes sncli unsuitable to store e.g. code snippets or ascii-armored pgp blobs.
