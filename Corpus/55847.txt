 URL : "https://github.com/zach-morris/plugin.program.iarl/issues/21" TITLE : local rom zipped files BODY : is it normal for iarl to unzip my zipped folders that have the games in them when i launch them? for example, had 007 golden eye n64 in a zipped folder. as soon as i launched 007 from iarl for the first time, it unzipped that folder, placed the game in the directory, and deleted the zipped folder.
