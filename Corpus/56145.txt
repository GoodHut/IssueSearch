BODY : hello, i found a spot at avelorn/saphery where you can kill mobs/npcs in the rvr area so with field of glory buff . if you are level 16 for example and kill those mobs while rested, you get ~16k xp. you can get from 16-31 in few hours. wanted the confirmation if its actually an exploit?...since bochamps doesn t give xp anymore to avoid leveling that fast with field of glory buff and its basically the same. the spot: east of dark elf chapter 13. the npcs are called champion of hoeth and defender of hoeth
