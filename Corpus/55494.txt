 URL : "https://github.com/davidkpiano/react-redux-form/issues/1055" TITLE : issue with collections BODY : i have a form, which model is defined like that: <form model= forms.reservation.trips 0 /> and control in it, which model is defined like that: <control.text model= .passengersnumber /> and i have a submit button, like that: <button type= submit /> when i hit the submit button, a redux action is dispatched, which looks like that: { type: 'rrf/addintent', model: 'forms.reservation.trips 0 ', intent: { type: 'submit' } } i then expect an action like that to be triggered, { type: 'rrf/setsubmitfailed', model: 'forms.reservation.trips 0 ', submitfailed: true, clearintents: { type: 'submit' } } however, nothing is triggered. i think the problem is at form-component.js - handleintents function. formvalue is getting a value of forms.reservation.trips . so the code is looking for intents changes at forms.forms.reservation.trips.$form.intents. however the rrf/addintent action added the intent to forms.forms.reservation.trips 0 .$form.intents. am i doing something wrong, or this is actual bug with the library?
