 URL : "https://github.com/Tuxemon/Tuxemon/issues/298" TITLE : animated battle sprites BODY : i remember suggesting this in irc, but never got around to actually reporting it. it's a feature i consider useful, and plan to personally use in potential games i might make in tuxemon. it also doesn't feel like something that would be difficult to support, however i don't know the code enough to attempt it. i suggest allowing battle sprites if not all defined images to be animated. the common format for doing this is storing each frame vertically or horizontally in the png file, and having a definition specify the size in pixels of each frame as well as the animation speed. the code then deducts the total number of frames, and orderly cycles through segments of the image at the specified speed. this would be a very nice visual enhancement, allowing for more detail and visual quality. i found several good examples of animated pixel sprites a while ago, which give us an idea of how animated in-battle sprites can improve the beauty and realism of the scene: ! sprite1 http://static.tumblr.com/474b36179a69d3f84978345d5283eca8/rfozj6b/hien26oml/tumblr_static_fennekin_pixel.gif ! sprite2 http://static.tumblr.com/4dc1072bdd110a27a9d0922d3a392c8e/rfozj6b/0pbn26nei/tumblr_static_bouncy_meowth_.gif ! sprite3 http://static.tumblr.com/6b9c6e80058f40787ccf7d0b4a1efb53/rfozj6b/jlcn26om9/tumblr_static_suicune_bby.gif ! sprite4 http://static.tumblr.com/22a09e751c29806f1d775438aafaa495/rfozj6b/vzdn26nvz/tumblr_static_mew_.gif
