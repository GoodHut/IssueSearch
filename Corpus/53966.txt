 URL : "https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/issues/384" TITLE : false antivrius report BODY : i've found that some antiviruses recognize this javascript as trojan script , but it's already confirmed as false positive. one of report is: https://www.virustotal.com/ /file/86db91d4ec31f22f619b887863877f16394f2e88f6b5e426849e569cd4a8df0d/detection this script is included in some wp plugins and it's confusion for some users and it's trouble with automatic scanners on some web hosting . also, it's too boring to explain it again and again. by my quick research, it seems that this line is source : js return new blob string.fromcharcode 0xfeff , blob , {type: blob.type} ; simple replacement of string.fromcharcode 0xfeff with \ufeff resolves this issue. other code which passes is string.fromcharcode 0xfeff + blob but i don't know is it good solution . i'm not js expert and i know that's better to use string.fromcharcode 0xfeff . please help us. regards, sasa
