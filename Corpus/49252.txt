 URL : "https://github.com/mitchellh/packer/issues/4530" TITLE : templating meta issue BODY : issues about wanting some kind of templating are opened frequently. this would be replacing variables inside static files with information from packer either during the file provisioner or inside floppy_files or the http_server here are some examples: https://github.com/mitchellh/packer/issues/3961 https://github.com/mitchellh/packer/issues/1673 https://github.com/mitchellh/packer/issues/2867 https://github.com/mitchellh/packer/issues/4451 i don't believe packer should be in the business of providing templating, as it's out of scope of packer in my opinion. however, it does seem to be requested often. i'd like to discuss here possible solutions, but right now i don't have any.
