 URL : "https://github.com/Wynncraft/Issues/issues/7384" TITLE : loot chest + mob agro BODY : normally when you open a chest, mobs won't attack you. if you are near a mob that has the pull spell eg; the boss in demon cave it will still pull you even though you have a loot chest open. which 1 doesn't let you take everything from the chest, and 2 mobs can damage you again.
