 URL : "https://github.com/KalikoCMS/DemoSite.Mvc/issues/11" TITLE : moving website is fragile BODY : logging here due to ability recreate issue quickly. will log in the core project too if need be. i have a website that runs under the root of a website in iis / and on my local machine i work on lots of different websites so i run then under virtual directories. when using linkproperty, paths are stored in the database based on the virtual directory the application is hosted in. upon migrating the website to a different virtual directory, all linkproperty url data stored in the database need to be updated. when there are lots of pages, this manual process of updating them all is quite labour intensive and time consuming. the linkproperty should not store the virtual directory information in the database and instead this should be resolved during execution of the page to make migrating the website easier. if a fix is implemented, this will be a breaking change so requires a discussion to work out how to deal with this problem.
