 URL : "https://github.com/revir/need-more-share2/issues/1" TITLE : conflict with icon name BODY : hi @revir , thank you for your time, and need-more-share2 is a great work! i've notice that, in the file fontello-embedded.css , font settings for all icon- classes is set to be fontello . this is almost right, however, could be making conflict sometimes. for example, if one uses icon-fa-heart in his/her html documents, fontello would be applied. however, icon-fa-heart is not declared in the very font. as a result, a blank block would be presented, which is medusa. this is because of a not-carefully-set namespace. i suppose that, icons used by need-more-share2 should be in a specific naming scheme, say icon-nms- . hence, you could easily apply the font family fontello to all and exact icons you want. bless. lh
