 URL : "https://github.com/utkarshkukreti/select.rs/issues/33" TITLE : new crate release BODY : hi, thanks for your crate which works beautiful for my use case; especially descendant is very useful. that said, the last release 0.3.0 does not support it yet. would you mind creating a new release and publish it crates.io. currently this prevents me from publishing my dependant crate. thanks, lukas
