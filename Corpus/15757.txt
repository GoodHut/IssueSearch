 URL : "https://github.com/aimalz/scippr/issues/24" TITLE : fix inference bug BODY : there's currently an underflow issue in the sampler part of the inference notebook -- in addition to getting samples where we expect them, we also get samples in a funny part of parameter space that correspond to large, positive values for the log-posterior probabilities. i'm going to try to fix that before we tackle the selection functions later this week.
