 URL : "https://github.com/mineshmshah/passport-tutorial/issues/10" TITLE : mixing passport and oauth BODY : i think it's worth asking what exactly this workshop is for? is it meant to teach people how to use passport and how the passport api corresponds to the concepts they learned in week 7? or is it meant to introduce people to the oauth workflow? at the moment it's trying to do a bit of both at the same time. giving the workshop a more focussed purpose is imo better.
