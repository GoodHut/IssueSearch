 URL : "https://github.com/BuildingSMART/BCF-XML/issues/151" TITLE : question on extension.xsd BODY : it seems this extension.xsd allows a predefined set of enum values for various properties inside the main markup.bcf file. now who decides what this file contains? the creator of the project? what happens if some drawing software / plugin doesn't support it / re-export it properly, or worse still overwrites it with a different version? likewise, can any collaborator add to it at will, change the order of the enums etc? i'm just worried about how to enforce these enum rules when parsing a bcf file? or is it better just to ignore them and allow any / no value to cover any of the eventualities i mentioned above?
