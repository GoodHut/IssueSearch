 URL : "https://github.com/BenjaminBrandmeier/angular2-image-gallery/issues/44" TITLE : can't view expanded images BODY : angular is sanitizing the active image view background-image style. getting this any time i attempt to open the image for full size view: warning: sanitizing unsafe style value url assets/img/gallery/..... this is appearing for me on a fresh project, literally built just to test the gallery. images go through graphicsmagick fine, and i'm getting all the thumbnails without issue probably because they're img tags, and the src isn't getting set as a background style . otherwise the gallery looks and works great. good work sir! was wondering if maybe you could just include a pipe into your template section where you inject the relative urls into the styles. i found this method, that seems like it should work import { pipe } from '@angular/core'; import { domsanitizer, safehtml, safestyle, safescript, safeurl, saferesourceurl } from '@angular/platform-browser'; @pipe { name: 'safe' } export class safepipe { constructor protected _sanitizer: domsanitizer { } public transform value: string, type: string = 'html' : safehtml | safestyle | safescript | safeurl | saferesourceurl { switch type { case 'html': return this._sanitizer.bypasssecuritytrusthtml value ; case 'style': return this._sanitizer.bypasssecuritytruststyle value ; case 'script': return this._sanitizer.bypasssecuritytrustscript value ; case 'url': return this._sanitizer.bypasssecuritytrusturl value ; case 'resourceurl': return this._sanitizer.bypasssecuritytrustresourceurl value ; default: throw new error invalid safe type specified: ${type} ; } } } can simply be called by 'whatever | safe: style ' for non-plagiarism's sake - https://forum.ionicframework.com/t/inserting-html-via-angular-2-use-of-domsanitizationservice-bypasssecuritytrusthtml/62562/5 i wish you luck sir! angular - ^4.0.0 node - 7.9.0
