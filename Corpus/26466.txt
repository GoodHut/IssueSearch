 URL : "https://github.com/gamejolt/issue-tracker/issues/982" TITLE : back from 404 issue BODY : of course, as a moderator, this happens to me a lot when cleaning up spam, but the bug itself can also hit normal users, as the bug does not occur in the moderation features themselves. when you open a thread a thread on the forum that was deleted by a moderator if the moderator did so after the thread overview was loaded on your machine, this is nothing odd you get the not found screen. so far so good, that was supposed to happen. if you click your browser's back button however, you get the not found screen again. to fix it the page needs to be refreshed.
