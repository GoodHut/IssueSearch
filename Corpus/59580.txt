 URL : "https://github.com/fkhadra/react-toastify/issues/81" TITLE : update existing toast? BODY : is there any way to update a toast that is already visible? for example, i want to create a toast with no auto-close timeout and type=info to show that a user-requested action is pending. then when the action is determined to be successful or failed, i want to update that existing toast to change the type to success or failure and enable the auto-close timeout. this could be achieved by closing and opening new toasts, but that gets confusing for the user if they have multiple pending actions. from what i've seen in the api there is currently only a method for dismissing a toast by id and not updating it by id.
