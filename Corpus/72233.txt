 URL : "https://github.com/ropensci/ropenaq/issues/26" TITLE : better use of api status BODY : i'd like to add a check of https://status.openaq.org/ in my code after i get a first error for a call. e.g. if the api health is bad, i should wait a bit / return null or something. i could also just wait but i think it's nicer if i can tell the user the reason why it's not working is the api status. @jflasher which link should i query to get information from the status page? i looked at the source of the status page and it didn't make me any wiser :grin: i also tried to deduce the name of the endpoint / the url from https://github.com/openaq/openaq-api/blob/2f7b0310fe59b63dc62d814301d5d36fe74eb226/api/routes/status.js and then i figured it'd be easier to ask :grimacing:
