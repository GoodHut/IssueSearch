 URL : "https://github.com/Exodus-Privacy/exodus/issues/3" TITLE : display app's full name BODY : the full name of an app should be displayed instead of a truncated name. example with groupon: ! exodus-groupon https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3419050/33217506-9284b5fe-d138-11e7-8590-9fb03da57c84.png i guess the title is truncated to respect the grid, so, ideally the fullname would be in the html and be truncated only by css, that would allow to search the fullname. then a title attribute or any popover would be fine would display the full title when the cursor is on the app.
