 URL : "https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/kinematics-dynamics/issues/128" TITLE : support kdl 1.3.0 ? BODY : the reason for not supporting kdl 1.3.0 was potentially supoorting 15 . given the final solution to 15, i'm not sure kdl 1.4.0 is actually a hard requirement current lack of support could be solved as stated here https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/kinematics-dynamics/issues/72 issuecomment-272325956 . must see if providing support to kdl 1.3.0 does not affect 15.
