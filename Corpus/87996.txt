 URL : "https://github.com/sabrinasun/befree/issues/68" TITLE : minor fix for form fields BODY : the link form and text form fields need has different lenth, could we give them a uniform width？ align the right border of title, title link, expanded text, teacher to a fixed width of 350px？ change the width of topic fields from 80px to 110px. also can we change title field to text area with 2 rows? hope it is a minor change.
