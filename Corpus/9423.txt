 URL : "https://github.com/TeamMoodGitHub/Baru-Term-1/issues/4" TITLE : week 3 + week 4 BODY : so this week i want you to make that little site we talked about where you have two web pages open, and click a button on once will alter the other page because both are talking to the same database. this should be ezpz and will prepare you for the next task. after this, i want you to make your own alarm clock in html/css/js as a website. this site will allow you to input an alarm clock time and will ring when it reaches that time, this shouldn't be to bad. but, when the alarm clock rings, i want it to ring on your phone as well if the website is open on the phone. it'll do this because the site will be talking to the same database and if alarm_ring == . true in the db, ring it. this will be your mvp basically. the minimum viable product. it'll be shitty, but it'll show me/you that your final project is doable.
