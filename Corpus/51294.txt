 URL : "https://github.com/Cortys/comic-backup/issues/61" TITLE : additional comic sites BODY : i understand this tool is currently designed with comixology in mind, but it would be nice to add other sites, like say dark horse. i'm still studying the code to see if i can add anything to it, but i have looked at dark horse's site and it appears their viewer actually downloads the images to your computer and then clears them when you leave. i was able to access the full size images using chrome web tools .
