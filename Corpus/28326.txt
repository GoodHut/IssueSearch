 URL : "https://github.com/RoelN/Font-Falsehoods/issues/1" TITLE : fonts =/= typefaces BODY : i think this idea is fantastic, kudos. in my common speech, i've mostly abandoned using the term typeface outside of conversations with graphic designers, because most people don't know what it means. however since this is a place to talk about falsehoods relating to fonts, the equivocation of fonts and typefaces is up there for me. when we say, i used the helvetica family we're referring to the typeface, but when we say i used helvetica light we're talking about the font. here's my attempt at being succinct about this: 1. the terms font and typeface are completely interchangeable i actually have no problem with people using font to mean typeface. if i did, my head would have exploded a long time ago. but the word font didn't mean what it does now even 50 years ago. a common misunderstanding of the term due in large part to microsoft word has changed the common meaning of the word. cheers. https://www.fastcodesign.com/3028971/whats-the-difference-between-a-font-and-a-typeface http://nerdplusart.com/type-terminology-smackdown/
