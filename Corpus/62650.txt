 URL : "https://github.com/wangg12/IRLS_tf_pytorch/issues/1" TITLE : correction in readme.md BODY : thanks for your great work on irls. there might be some small errors in readme.md. original : in this implementation, we use svd to solve peudo inverse of singular matrices. the svd in torch is somehow less numerically stable than that in tensorflow, so we use a slight regularization in the valina irls in pytorch. correction : 1. peuso â†’ pseudo 2. so we use a slight regularization in the valinda irls in pytorch or in tensorflow? 3. what does valinda mean here? best wishes!
