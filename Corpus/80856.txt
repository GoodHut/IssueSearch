 URL : "https://github.com/traity/didentity/issues/1" TITLE : use a namecoin namespace BODY : hello! namecoin developer here. it's great to see more innovative uses of namecoin. i'm under the impression that the namecoin names that your software generates look a lot like this https://namecoin.webbtc.com/name/n9qplclycxj7s4l9zrzbqpzvxqchrfygpr_1eafdc8b08ed45840ea94b3931fe4644b2c0c1bd . is that correct? if so, i notice that your names aren't using a namespace. in namecoin, a standard convention is to prefix your names with a short namespace string ending with a forward slash . for example, domain names start with d/ , and identities start with id/ . this helps avoid accidental collisions between use cases, and also can be helpful for lightweight namecoin clients that want to prune data that they're not interested in. it would be awesome if your software could produce names that have a namespace feel free to pick one of your choice; as far as i know there aren't any other implementations that are addressing your use case, so there's no need to use an existing namespace . if you have any questions about namecoin, feel free to ask -- i can also be found in namecoin and namecoin-dev on freenode. cheers!
