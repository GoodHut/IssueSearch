 URL : "https://github.com/databricks/spark-tfocs/issues/30" TITLE : how to get started! BODY : would it be possible to add a get started section to the read-me file. i mean this is a scientific library, and scientists usually jump from one framework to another to find what best suits them. so it is better to add this section to make their life easier. i have started using spark and scala couples of weeks ago and i want to use spark in a functional data analysis project. i passed by spark tfocs and i am not not sure how to get started this library is not shipped with spark . after some research about sbt i figured it out. i downloaded the source code and attached it to my sbt project. it was simple but if it was here in the first place it would have saved me some time.
