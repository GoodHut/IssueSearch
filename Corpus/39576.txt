 URL : "https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/issues/402" TITLE : skip le doesn't work BODY : hi @andryyy, i am running mailcow behind a web proxy in a dev environment. i do not intend to use the built-in acme client of mailcow because i already have le certbot in the host machine. i prefer having certbot in the host machine because i host multiple dev projects that i believe also needs le, so obtaining another certificate with mailcow would be unnecessary because i already have one. hence i added this directive to the conf file: skip_lets_encrypt=y . but whenever i symlink the necessary le .pem files into the data/assets/ssl/ it gets overwritten whenever i restart the containers.
