BODY : hi, i've wondered about this for a while. is it possible to print with ansi colors in a slime repl buffer? if i load the cl-ansi-text library from quicklisp ql:quickload :cl-ansi-text , and i run cl-ansi-text:yellow yellow in the slime repl the output is:  33myellow 0m . when i run the same commands directly in an sbcl repl, it prints as expected yellow in a yellow color. is it possible to use ansi colors in slime? or maybe there's some workaround? thanks, ben
