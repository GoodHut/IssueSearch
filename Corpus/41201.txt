 URL : "https://github.com/moosotc/llpp/issues/60" TITLE : zooming is backwards BODY : after yesterday's commit 0f57b48a6aa59287e0a167d3610a070261f4c0f4 , scrolling with the mousewheel is reversed: a scroll up event now causes the page to zoom out instead of in , unlike most other applications e.g. firefox, chromium, other pdf viewers . likewise, scrolling down is a zoom-in instead of a zoom-out.
