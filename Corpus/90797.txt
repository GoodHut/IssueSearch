 URL : "https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia/mapboard/issues/41" TITLE : store table data in state BODY : the problem is that when horizontal tables are filtered, the map features need to be filtered as well. adding filtered table data to state should be a viable solution. we could add something like this to the vuex state: tables: { activefeature: null, rowsfiltered: { // table hash => rows or row indexes } }
