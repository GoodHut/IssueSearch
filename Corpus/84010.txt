 URL : "https://github.com/contao/core-bundle/issues/718" TITLE : contao jquery integration BODY : is there a reason why the contao/core-bundle is only requiring version 1.11.3 of the contao-components/jquery package? since version 1.12.4 is available, a new contao 4 installation will install this version. but there is also a 'new' jquery 3.1.1 version in the contao-components/jquery repository!?
