 URL : "https://github.com/smeijer/leaflet-geosearch/issues/119" TITLE : local nominatim search BODY : i've been playing around with offline maps and in order to do geocoding i installed a local nominatim server, but i'm having trouble finding a way to change the url on geosearch so it points to my local nominatim search. i've changed the url found on openstreetmap provider, bundle.js and bundle.min.js and no luck. any help would be much appreciated.
