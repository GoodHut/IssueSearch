 URL : "https://github.com/IBMStreams/streamsx.topology/issues/753" TITLE : optimise cats cradle. BODY : adjacent parallel regions where the second region is hashed are not optimized due to the insertion of the hash adder. this was done but was intentionally removed to allow cleanup related to optimizing topologies for 4.2 by using job config overlays to force channel isolation, rather than insertion of isolation markers which didn't force isolation on 4.2 due to a change in parallel region fusing in 4.2 .
