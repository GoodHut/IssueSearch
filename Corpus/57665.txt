BODY : hey there, i was working on a pretty lengthy doc in dillinger when it suddenly reset to a new doc starting dillinger.... this past week. previously, the doc had saved itself for months, so it was quite surprising to have it reset. is there any way to recover lost docs with dillinger? i lost quite a bit of work and would really like to be able to recover it.
