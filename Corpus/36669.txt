 URL : "https://github.com/geex-arts/ngx-flickity/issues/4" TITLE : image / imagesloaded BODY : i'm trying to load images in the slides but i'm finding the container is not matching the height of the images. i.e just a few px in height. my first thought was that i need to use imagesloaded, so i tried updating ngx-flickity to use the flickity-imagesloaded dependency instead, but that made no difference. i can't really work out if the issue is with this module or something else.
