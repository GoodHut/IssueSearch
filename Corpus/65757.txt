 URL : "https://github.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/issues/411" TITLE : latest tag is incorrect BODY : my reason: the latest tag listed is wrong for public libraries. steps to reproduce: i noticed this via npm install -s immutable npm 5 . if you use a verdaccio library you get the rc version of immutable and if you use npmjs.org you the true latest tag 3.x you can also verify this via the urls which at the time of this writing shows: https://registry.npmjs.org/immutable _id : immutable , _rev : 301-da1702370f366fb61a98d20142465e0c , name : immutable , description : immutable data collections , dist-tags :{ latest : 3.8.2 , rc : 4.0.0-rc.9 }, and my localhost:port/immutable shows: name : immutable , _rev : 2322-1093671c0ff912d2 , dist-tags : { latest : 4.0.0-rc.4 , rc : 4.0.0-rc.9 }, app version: 2.6.3 . i am not sure if the previous version was correct, but sinopia was also wrong.
