 URL : "https://github.com/alanxz/rabbitmq-c/issues/419" TITLE : ./configure and pk-config BODY : looking for a little advice here as to where i am going wrong. i have followed the steps at alanxz.github.io/rabbitmq-c/ to get this running on my debian vm. i am running into a problem i have seen a couple places on the web. i get the following error when running ./configure: ./configure: line 12655: syntax error near unexpected token '0.17' ./configure: line 12655: 'pkg_prog_pkg_config 0.17 ' i have seen that this would likely be contributed to pkg-config being missing, but i have verified multiple times that it is both installed and up to date. i'm suspecting something is not configured properly, so any suggestions of where to look would helpful. thanks.
