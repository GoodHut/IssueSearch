 URL : "https://github.com/planetk/homebridge-netatmo/issues/48" TITLE : homekit camera support BODY : hey, with the new homekit app supporting cameras, wanted to know if there were any plans to extend this plugin out to add the live streaming for the welcome cameras as well. looks like its accessible via the api: https://dev.netatmo.com/dev/resources/technical/reference/cameras/live i'm thinking of using the ffmpeg plugin in the meantime but i'm sure having the cameras integrated into this plugin would be a much more elegant solution especially if you can choose whether or not to look at the local version if home i don't actually own a netatmo welcome, but i'm thinking of getting one but thank you for all your hard work on this plugin! it makes it easier for people like me to integrate these devices with our existing setups.
