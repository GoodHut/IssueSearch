 URL : "https://github.com/rails/webpacker/issues/702" TITLE : webpack dll plugin BODY : has anyone been able to get the webpack dll plugin https://webpack.js.org/plugins/dll-plugin/ to work with webpacker? i followed the guide here: http://engineering.invisionapp.com/post/optimizing-webpack/ and ended up with a dll that compiles, webpack building, but i couldn't get javascript include to work as it was building a separate manifest which means the javascript_pack_tag helper couldn't find it.
