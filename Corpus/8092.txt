 URL : "https://github.com/cozuya/secret-hitler/issues/307" TITLE : mod log archive BODY : refresh mod log every day 12:00 am est and add previous mod log to an archive that is accessible in the page. or even just auto add like a break/bar or something stating/showing it's a new day or both, where the past week is accessible with breaks/bar showing a new day, and with each new day, the last instance of that unique day goes to the archive. so once it becomes monday, there is a bar present that separates it as a new day and the other monday goes to the archive; so there are a total of 7 days on the mod log this will help with dealing with afk's if we take the add losses compounding daily route
