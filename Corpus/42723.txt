 URL : "https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/issues/130" TITLE : button header on dual BODY : hi, thanks for this great work, i understand this question have been ask many times, just want to clarify one more time, i do this on dual with original firmware, gnd/button0/button1/gnd when gnd connect button0, relay 1 toggle, than disconnect and conect again, relay 1 toggle, when gnd connect button1, relay 2 toggle, than disconnect and conect again, relay 2 toggle, double click on button0/1 won't be other action just quick on/off to mapped relay, also it won't affect another reply, button0 only change relay1 status and same as other, can your code run as same way? also can it more than toggle? means like sonoff basic with switch gnd connect button0 > relay 1 on gnd disconnect button0 > realy 1 off appreciate what you do on this. thank you and regards ham
