 URL : "https://github.com/kyuupichan/electrumx/issues/221" TITLE : adding testnet5 support BODY : i'm trying to add testnet5 support to electrumx and i'm running into some issues. first, in the is_coinbase function of class tx, self.inputs 0 is causing an exception because self.inputs has length zero. why might this be? i patched it momentarily by adding a check for len self.inputs > 1 , but i don't know if this is appropriate. second, in spend_utxo of blockprocessor, the call to pack '<h', tx_idx is throwing an exception: > struct.error: ushort format requires 0 <= number <= 0x7fff 2 + 1 tx_idx has a value of 2^32-1 at that point. what does this mean?
