BODY : hi, thanks for making a , it is very nice and is coming in handy for a little library i'm working on. could we have a simple setting function, like a-set ? something that could be used like: el setq mylist a-set mylist :one 1 a-merge is useful, but having to make a list to pass to it seems like overkill when i only want to update one value. and unfortunately, setf doesn't work with a-get , so a-merge seems like the only way to update values using a . thanks.
