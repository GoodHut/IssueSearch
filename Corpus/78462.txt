 URL : "https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/issues/581" TITLE : proposal public channels BODY : a public channel is similar to a group chat, but differs in how users are managed. in a group chat, users need to be explicitly invited by a moderator of the group chat. in a public channel, subscription is based on a shared secret arbitrary string , so anyone who knows the secret can join and leave at any time, and no one has special privileges no way to ban a user . also, while a group has an explicit existence one of the clients must create it before inviting others , a public channel has an implicit existence, that is, joining a channel that does not exist creates it. this could be useful for quickly creating large makeshift groups using a throwaway secret without the hassle of having to add/verify everyone's ids , or having large persistent public irc-like channels in cases where moderation is not a priority/requirement. having an audio channel which you could freely join/leave and possibly un/mute specific users would be even better.
