 URL : "https://github.com/Wynncraft/Issues/issues/8210" TITLE : game crashes upon load-in BODY : i haven't been playing long, only level 12 or something, and i was trying to go do the quest at katoa ranch. i was walking on the trail that comes around from behind and all the sudden my fps dropped indefinitely and got mauled by a horde of zombies. i spawned back in maltic, and decided to give it another try, everything was fine, up until i got to the same exact chunk that the path leading up to the ranch. my frames started dropping and i actually managed to very slowly make my way inside the ranch walls. inside the ranch itself, t seemed totally fine. i tried leaving and the same issue started happening. i logged out, not wanting to deal with it. later, i tried logging back in to see if a server reset would help solve the issue, it almost did as i logged back into the main server select hub. i selected a server, a different one then i was on before surely. my screen went black, all i could see was my hud, and then minecraft stopped responding. i have tried multiple times to log back in, only to be faced with the same exact problem of everything being pitch black except being able to see my hud, and then minecraft crashing instantly upon attempting to load in. i'm not sure if there is much you can do to help, but this is really annoying as i started playing yesterday, and was really excited to play...i would hate to start over completely, as i'm pretty dedicated to this character i have now. if there is anything you can do at all, please let me know.
