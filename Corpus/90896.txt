 URL : "https://github.com/laravel/framework/issues/21085" TITLE : suggestion migrations ddl BODY : - laravel version: 5.4 - php version: 7.1 - database driver & version: 10.1.21-mariadb like the title says it, it's a feature request when running make:migration i would like to have 2 more files generated, with the same name as the migration file and the suffix _up_ddl and _down_ddl for the up and down functions of the migration. initially they would be empy just like the migration file but upon running ./artisan migrate they would be populated with the ddl generated by the --pretend option. maybe they could live in the database/migrations/ddl folder or in the same database/migrations folder next to their migration file. i propose this because normally i don't run artisan migrate or artisan migrate:rollback in production and i always need to keep the ddl for each migration up and down when i need to update the production db or rollback changes in production and this would automate the process. maybe it could be an option for make:migration like --ddl and it would do the above. thanks.
