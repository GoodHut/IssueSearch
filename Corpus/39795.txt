 URL : "https://github.com/googlecartographer/cartographer_ros/issues/356" TITLE : strange tf behaviour BODY : hello, i'm working on map generation with different tools and i currently struggle with google cartographer for ros. only the first scan of the map appears on rviz and when i check my tf frames, the robot frames laser, base_link, etc stay at the same position while my odom frame is moving backward w.r.t. the robot movement in the simulator. it actually works fine with gmapping so i don't know what goes wrong here. here are my launch and config file for cartographer https://drive.google.com/open?id=0b1c... https://drive.google.com/open?id=0b1c... and here is my tf tree if that can help but it seems all right https://drive.google.com/open?id=0b1c... and finally here is a small bag file https://drive.google.com/open?id=0b1ch0l8kxyjzb1fous1kbdzozhc i think there is a problem with tf somewhere because roswtf show me this but i can't figure out where: warning the following node subscriptions are unconnected: /cartographer_node: /tf_static /rviz_1496128181484858929: /tf_static /map_updates i'm relatively new with ros, sorry if i misunderstand something. thank you in advance for your help
