 URL : "https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/issues/1574" TITLE : structure view unusable BODY : currently the structure view lists everything in the module indiscriminately and fully expanded. the expand and collapse buttons fully expand and/or collapse, and collapse means _everything_ is collapsed mod.rs visible only . manually expanding the single root after a collapse shows that all the lower levels e.g. impl s are expanded as well, making the manoeuvre useless. there is no way to filter for example, pub lic entries only, omitting impl s, constants/static suppression; etc. the only way to get a top-level summary is to manually collapse all the top-level entries, one-by-one with the mouse. this issue is to request: - filter support: public/private; impl; const/static - alt expand/collapse support that _remembers_ internal expansion toggles. the last point will enable swift summary views: collapse all with alt followed by expand a single entry will show just those entries immediately below that entry collapsed . these are features that make the structure view a useful summary tool in java and are sadly entirely lacking in the rust plugin support.
