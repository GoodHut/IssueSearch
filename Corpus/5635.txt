 URL : "https://github.com/olafurpg/scalafmt/issues/730" TITLE : roadmap for v1 BODY : scalafmt v0.1 came out in march 2016. here are some download stats in january 2017 - scalafmt was downloaded ~10k times from maven last month alone. - intellij plugin is at ~23k downloads in total, with >6k installs on the latest 0.5.x series the formatting output is fairly stable now big changes like in v0.5.0 to the default style typically provide fallback config for old styles . i think now is a good time to start thinking about releasing v1.0. these are organizational things i'd like to get done first - publish under org.scalafmt domain - all maintainers have release rights to org.scalafmt - move to scalafmt github organization - move docs to scalafmt.org - automatic releases on push tag or merge into master 721 other: - clean up config layout - suggestions??? i'd be interested to hear what people think.
