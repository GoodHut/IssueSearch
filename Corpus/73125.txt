 URL : "https://github.com/bradfrost/style-guide-guide/issues/7" TITLE : components overview page BODY : i created a landing template that works well for guidelines and styles, but it doesn't really work the same way for the components landing page. i think this should be a simple if/else fix in the landing template. something like if page.group == components then loop through the component subpage categories.
