 URL : "https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/8302" TITLE : improve dtrees performance BODY : system information version - opencv => 3.2 master branch - operating system / platform => windows 7 - compiler => vc++ detailed description ! image https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5351764/23473275/e22a2258-feaf-11e6-8294-39d3d6a024f6.png i'm profiling the cv::ml::boost->train method to try and speed it up takes 30min+ for 19000 samples with 8000 features and notices a big chunk of time is spend in updateweightsandtrim -> predicttrees -> predicttrees. as far as i can see the buf and derivative variables catbuf and votes it allocates is only used when either using votes with predict_maxvote or as storage for categorical variables so it should be safe to skip if neither are present <!-- your description --> steps to reproduce profile in release so optimizations are enabled with a large sample set and feature vectors
