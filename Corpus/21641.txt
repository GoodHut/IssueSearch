 URL : "https://github.com/SimCMinMax/AethysRotation/issues/75" TITLE : frost mage changes BODY : there are a few changes that need to be made to frost mage's rotation. 1. ice barrier. should be up whenever possible. 2. frost nova. instant cast and will triple damage from ice lance. 3. spellsteal. if the target has a buff that can be stolen, steal it. 4. invisibility/ice block. good defensive spells. not sure if they can be added, but they should be used before taking fatal damage. 5. conjure refreshment. i doubt this can be added, but if you don't have any conjured mana buns, this should be cast to save time when you need them. 6. blink/shimmer. can be used in combination with frost nova. if your target is within frost nova range, nova then blink/shimmer out of damage rank.
