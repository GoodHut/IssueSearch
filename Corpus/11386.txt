 URL : "https://github.com/badaix/snapcast/issues/308" TITLE : groups vs. zones BODY : hi, nice work! i just moved my home audio from a pulseaudio/airplay based distribution to snapcast. doing this i come upon a few snags; metadata and zones. i've been trying to create static zones for areas in my house but it seems the groups are dynamic and there is no json api to name them? i can edit the config file but the edits are forgotten once the group is empty ie no clients left in group . what i want to achieve is define static zones in my house which can be controlled independently mute/volume , each with a dynamic json api set of speakers snapclient . each zone can then be assigned to play any of the defined input streams in the server. it seems to me i need a json api to change a group name and mark it static for a setup like this to work? keep up the good work :+1: frafall
