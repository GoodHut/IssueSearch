 URL : "https://github.com/beetwo/toucan/issues/69" TITLE : session issue on ios BODY : description it seems that when using an ios device iphone and adding toucan to the homescreen a user needs to login every time he clicks on the icon. explanation this relates to session handling which by default is set to session length. checking the remember me box during login should set this to 2 weeks. solution i'd need some help from an iphone user @laurapirgie to confirm this. please login using the checkbox and see if things work for you?
