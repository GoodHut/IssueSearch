 URL : "https://github.com/zero-os/0-stor/issues/24" TITLE : 0-stor: questions on spec BODY : - is consumer an iyo id? and if yes is this 16 bytes? - why does it have to be an iyo id? - and the spec suggests it is a hash of iyo id but then there is no point using iyo because we cannot find user back. suggestion: - does not have to be iyo id, in future it will be possible to add unique id's more than 1 to iyo for a user. for now just consider 16 bytes id.
