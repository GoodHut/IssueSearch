 URL : "https://github.com/halt-hammerzeit/webpack-isomorphic-tools/issues/135" TITLE : incremental build slowdown BODY : hi i encounter a significant slowdown in the incremental build performance after adding webpack-insomorphic-tools. in particular, it adds around 2,5-3,5 sec to the existing 3,5 sec. here is my isomorphic config: module.exports = { webpack_assets_file_path: path.join publicpath , 'webpack-assets.json' , patch_require: true, debug: true, alias: resolve.alias, assets: { images: { extensions: 'jpeg', 'jpg', 'png', 'gif', 'svg' , }, fonts: { extensions: 'woff', 'ttf', 'woff2', 'eot', , }, style_modules: { extensions: 'scss', 'css' , }, }, }; i also have many errors in webpack-isomorphic-tools/plugin output: > webpack-isomorphic-tools/plugin error error: more than a single candidate module was found in webpack stats for require d path !!../../../node_modules/css-loader/index.js!../../../node_modules/postcss-loader/index.js!../../../node_modules/sass-loader/index.js?outputstyle=expanded!./index.scss . enable debug: true flag in webpack-isomorphic-tools configuration for more info. as i understand, it can be related to the fact that ,/index.scss is used as a name for many .scss files in this app. can it be the reason for a slowdown or there may be something else? thanks
