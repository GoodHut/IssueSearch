 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/ReSub/issues/17" TITLE : aync action demo BODY : hi there, loving the simplicity of resub so far, but like with many other projects in this ecosystem i am at a loss until i can wrap my head around an async action example to say hit an api, get some data, and update store/state unidirectionally. any guidance or a demo would be greatly appreciated.
