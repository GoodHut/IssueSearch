 URL : "https://github.com/PDX-mth651/CSRclass/issues/1" TITLE : discussion project details BODY : hello @naweewan and anyone else in the class. thanks for setting up this repo. i'm not too clear about all the details of this project: - is this repo a team project to build a finite element library and solver? where everyone contributes to the code. - or just a place to get help, post questions, etc, but work on our own solvers individually? stephan
