 URL : "https://github.com/bluss/rust-itertools/issues/248" TITLE : group_until the predicate BODY : maybe name is not really suitable because it doesn't really similar to group_by the idea is to make groups until the predicate returns true. e.g if we has 0..10 calling group_until |x| x%3 == 0 && x != 0 should return an iterator over: 0,1,2,3 , 4,5,6 , 7,8,9 i find split https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html method.split / splitn https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html method.splitn in std, but it does remove the elements. and i didn't find anything useful in itertools, maybe missed something?
