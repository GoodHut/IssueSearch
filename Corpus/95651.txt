 URL : "https://github.com/Schmavery/facebook-chat-api/issues/422" TITLE : design question - threadid BODY : i'm making a bot script where when the user runs it, they can authenticate with a facebook account other than their own and that account will act as the bot, and will send them a message. something like this, > enter the bot's username: > enter the bot's password: however, to send them a message i need their fb thread id, so i have an additional field that looks like, > enter your facebook id: this is so i am able to do things like so: <br> using conf https://github.com/sindresorhus/conf and inquirer https://github.com/sboudrias/inquirer.js login {email: config.get 'username' , password: config.get 'password' }, function callback err, api { if err return console.error err ; var yourid = config.get 'id' ; var msg = {body: hello world! }; api.sendmessage msg, yourid ; } ; is there a better way to go about this? the user needs two facebook account regardless one for the bot, and one to send messages to the bot , but can i get the thread id just from an email or some other way? seems a bit annoying for a user to have to look up their facebook id in their cookies. let me know, thanks!
