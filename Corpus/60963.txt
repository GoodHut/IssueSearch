 URL : "https://github.com/fossasia/susi_server/issues/219" TITLE : add shazam like feature BODY : actual behaviour no such implementation which returns name of a song when a small audio is passed to it. expected behaviour similar to shazam, if a user says for example susi find this song for me , ios and android client should start recording the song being played and report the name of the song. steps to reproduce it this recorded audio will be evaluated with the help of an algorithm and a signature key will be generated. this key will then be sent as a parameter to some open api. would you like to work on the issue? yes
