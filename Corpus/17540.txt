 URL : "https://github.com/23/resumable.js/issues/354" TITLE : problems with 401 BODY : if i use resumable and the requests are done without authentication it just runs in an endless loop :- i would like for it to halt on response 401. i have tried to do console.log message on error and on fileerror but that value is just undefined. so any idea on how to solve this, or is this a bug in resumable?
