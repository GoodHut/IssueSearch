 URL : "https://github.com/Sheights/StarboundSimpleVoreMod/issues/101" TITLE : game crashing with mod BODY : don't know if this has already been up or solved or anything, i read a few of the other issue logs and couldn't find it. i have the mod version 8.3 and it works fine, there's no problems with it... however any newer version doesn't work. i've tried every release since then and it closes the game before it even gets to the main title screen. i don't know if it's my computer or if i'm just doing something wrong with installing it, but it won't work.
