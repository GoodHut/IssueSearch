 URL : "https://github.com/aestheticinteractive/Hover-UI-Kit/issues/66" TITLE : radio buttons on the fly BODY : sorry for so many questions.. but i am looking to produce radio buttons upon entry of the program. any good tips for that? currently i am doing it via gameobject radiobutton = new gameobject project1 ; radiobutton.addcomponent<hoveritembuilder> .performbuild ; radiobutton.addcomponent<hovershapearc> ; radiobutton.transform.parent = gameobject.transform; however, each time the object in question does not show up with the already rendered items. do these radio buttons have to be predesigned or can i do it via code? best! and thank you
