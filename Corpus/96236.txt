 URL : "https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/1783" TITLE : entry actions on edit view BODY : similar to editing a user element, it would be nice to be able to register actions that can be triggered when in the entry edit view. currently there isn't an event on the controller. the user controller has an registeruseractionsevent to handle this.
