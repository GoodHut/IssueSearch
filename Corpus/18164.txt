 URL : "https://github.com/joaotavora/sly/issues/119" TITLE : spacemacs + eldoc BODY : i haven't been able to isolate this yet, so looking for guidance: in spacemacs, i configured sly exactly as i have it configured in vanilla emacs. in the repl, eldoc hints are only displayed for standard cl symbols, and nothing is shown for third party libraries. as a test, i did in-package :alexandria and proceeded to type when-let nd no eldoc hint was shown. it is shown however in a file buffer - this issue is specific to the repl when used within spacemacs - the issue does not exist in vanilla emacs with the same sly setup. any help would be appreciated.
