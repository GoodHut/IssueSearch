 URL : "https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/421" TITLE : draft multirom support BODY : this issue is still under construction. this is draft from my memory, i need to do fact cheking. multirom https://github.com/tasssadar/multirom is dualboot script that runs after kernel and before init scripts. it lets users pick different rom that are installed by twrp fork https://github.com/tasssadar/team-win-recovery-project . it is using modified kexec-tools https://github.com/tasssadar/kexec-tools for running kernel of different rom. before running another kernel, it mounts paths to proper locations, for that different rom, from internal storage or usb flash which seams like a better solution for us, right now, since we are using custom file storage
