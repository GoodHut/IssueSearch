 URL : "https://github.com/gslab-econ/gslab_python/issues/100" TITLE : write integration tests BODY : our unit tests only check that functions are called in the way that we expect. they don't check the actual output from any functions. write integration tests that check the output of functions using previous integration tests from make.py framework as a starting point. we should only test the integration of features if the user has explicitly specified this option in gslab_python e.g., python setup.py test_integration .
