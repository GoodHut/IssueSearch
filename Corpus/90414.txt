 URL : "https://github.com/Macaulay2/M2/issues/704" TITLE : setup vim script for user BODY : i've just added files from manoj kummini and david cook providing an interface to macaulay2 in vim at https://github.com/macaulay2/m2/commit/880f42529ae1d7bbceeb238869d9407ec6d56673 . but now we have to arrange for the files to be distributed in binary distributions and write a function setupvim , analogous to setupemacs , to install them in the user's home directory. we also need a script to generate the symbol table for vim highlighting, analogous to m2/macaulay2/emacs/makesyms.m2 .
