 URL : "https://github.com/usbr/Pisces/issues/158" TITLE : rest api enhancement BODY : my recent work using the swashbuckle nuget package https://www.nuget.org/packages/swashbuckle has shown that it is super easy to allow our api to be compliant with the open api specification https://swagger.io/ . i even found some samples where we can use it with nancy http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/generating-api-document-in-nancy-using-swagger/ . should we try to rework the /applications/pisceswebservices project to use swashbuckle with nancy?
