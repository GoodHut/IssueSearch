 URL : "https://github.com/Ocramius/from-helpers-to-middleware/issues/4" TITLE : how tests change? BODY : there is one thing that i find it hard for some people to understand about testability. when i test zf2 bloated controllers this https://github.com/ocramius/from-helpers-to-middleware/blob/gh-pages/slides/from-helpers-to-middleware/zf2-and-decent-patterns/controller-3.html and this https://github.com/ocramius/from-helpers-to-middleware/blob/gh-pages/slides/from-helpers-to-middleware/zf2-and-decent-patterns/controller-4.html and code coverage is 100%, i am sure that every piece of code and every business logic is tested. the other way can be sneaky and bastard: in a middleware stack line this https://github.com/ocramius/from-helpers-to-middleware/tree/gh-pages/examples/middleware i can reach 100% code-coverage, but i can mess the entire business logic up in factories while building the app. no type-hint forces me to delegate a middleware before anothr. can you pinpoint how tests have to adapt?
