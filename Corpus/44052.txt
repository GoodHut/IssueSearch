 URL : "https://github.com/0125/ahk-rs-dropLogger/issues/81" TITLE : drop table categories BODY : add option to guilog whether or not to combine 'normal' drops into a single 'drop table' tab instead of having a separate tab for each category: eg: herbs drop table, weapons drop table - maybe don't add 'drop table' to each tabs name but manually append this when reading active tab name in getmouseobj or whatever. so a 'rare' tab but keep the combined drops table aka 'drop table' - adjust database functions to also retrieve drop table category/title and save these as separate drop tables eg - adjust functions in the rest of the script that are affected by this change
