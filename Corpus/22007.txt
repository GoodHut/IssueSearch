 URL : "https://github.com/audiohacked/OpenCorsairLink/issues/45" TITLE : hx750i psu support BODY : hello! just got a new linux machine with an hx750i and trying to give this library a try before attempting to write on in go. it appears that @awoland added hx850i, so i've tried to copy that device's configuration and modified the product id to fit the hx750i 0x1c05 . ocl is able to pick up the device, but it appears that all queries to the device are returning 03 fe 00 00 00 00 . i noticed a similar behavior when attempting to talk with the device from go. is some kind of initialization handshake necessary to communicate with the device? here's what i've added so far: patch diff --git a/device.c b/device.c index 60d0df9..4dfd2c2 100644 --- a/device.c +++ b/device.c @@ -164,7 +164,19 @@ struct corsair_device_info corsairlink_devices = { .led_control_count = 0, .fan_control_count = 1, .pump_index = 0, - }, + }, + { + .vendor_id = 0x1b1c, + .product_id = 0x1c05, + .device_id = 0xff, + .name = hx750i , + .read_endpoint = 0x01|libusb_endpoint_in, + .write_endpoint = 0x01|libusb_endpoint_out, + .driver = &corsairlink_driver_rmi, + .led_control_count = 0, + .fan_control_count = 1, + .pump_index = 0, + }, }; size_t corsairlink_device_count = sizeof corsairlink_devices /sizeof corsairlink_devices 0 ; and here are a couple of gists with lsusb and ocl output: sudo lsusb -d 1b1c: -v > lsusb.txt https://gist.github.com/mdlayher/9357a20cb2f1252788b87ae5c257f186 sudo ./opencorsairlink.elf --debug --device 0 > ocl.txt https://gist.github.com/mdlayher/ebc53483b285459015f7fec44c454157 if anyone reading is able to provide some insight, i'd greatly appreciate it. thanks for your time.
