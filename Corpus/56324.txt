 URL : "https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements/issues/1074" TITLE : mouse button to scroll BODY : this was one of the main things i used karabiner for, but i don't seem to be able to find how to do it with elements, if you even can? i wish i'd never 'upgraded' my os tbh. is there any way to map a mouse button to activate scroll in elements?
