 URL : "https://github.com/informatics-isi-edu/chaise/issues/1336" TITLE : refresh acl after login BODY : user login handling. if a user logs in pressing the login button, we need to re-fetch/introspect the catalog again and start the flow from beginning. if a user logs in because of a session timeout or not permitted error, we need to identify a way to handle rights for all the entities that were rendered before. for now we won't be handling this case. i am not sure whether this should be in chaise or ermrestjs..
