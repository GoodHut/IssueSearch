 URL : "https://github.com/bitwarden/mobile/issues/162" TITLE : high ram usage BODY : two services from bitwarden appear to be using a lot of ram, total they represent about 500mb when the app isn't even being used assume this is for autofill . i will reinstall the app at some point and see if i can add the specific services, but i removed it and suddenly my phone was running a ton better on a samsung galaxy s8 .
