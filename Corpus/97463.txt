 URL : "https://github.com/chrmarti/testissues/issues/4249" TITLE : group policies gpo support BODY : i need to pre-configure and force-configure settings in vscode for a larger team. we need to make sure all of them are using the same settings or we end with a mess of tabs/spaces 2/4/8 just as one example. some other things that come in mind are: - disable automatic update - add required addons - disable bad addons - all settings that can be made in the json file. if this is already possible and i just missed the documentation let me know, please.
