 URL : "https://github.com/gdh1995/vimium-plus/issues/12" TITLE : vimium ++ vs vimium BODY : i would like to ask the difference between vimium++ and vimium simple. well, you rewrote the functionality on _typescript_ instead of _coffee_. the question is why? if there are any advantages, the functionality can be new or bags are fixed. in the description there is no comparison of vimium++ vs vimium . not obvious advantages. if this fork then take you with the fix and the operating time that appear in https://github.com/philc/vimium? regards raingart
