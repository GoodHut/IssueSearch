 URL : "https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/issues/1207" TITLE : timestamp and precision BODY : the timestamp data type in postgresql by default has 6 digits after the decimal point. if you store this time in postgresql via some method: 2017-02-07t19:53:43.242999 then read it back with this node-postgres driver, you'll get 2017-02-07t19:53:43.242 i.e., the driver textually truncates the last 3 digits, rather than rounding to the nearest millisecond. this bug or very bad design decision caused me a large amount of pain recently...
