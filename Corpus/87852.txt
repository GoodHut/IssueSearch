 URL : "https://github.com/BB20101997/MBMA/issues/13" TITLE : mcmod.info for joined jar BODY : the generated jar by the default jar task creates a jar with the mcmod.info from the mbmacore it should use a mcmod.info containing the info from mbmacore and mbmaapi it can't figure out how to tell gradle to exclude the one from core and include a merged one. i got it to either: - include core and the merged one causes build error: duplicate file - include none not as intended - include core
