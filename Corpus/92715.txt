 URL : "https://github.com/leopuleo/test-support-wordpress/issues/45" TITLE : 10606 transaction rejected BODY : <p>replies: 0</p> <p>a customer in the usa has received a “10606 transaction rejected” notification message, when he tried to buy an item.</p>
<p>the message says there is “not enough “—item name—” to fulfil your order right now.</p>
<p>there is one in stock though and i was able to buy it myself without this error message. i am in the uk </p>
<p>any idea why he might be getting this message?</p>
