 URL : "https://github.com/davidstutz/bootstrap-multiselect/issues/936" TITLE : issue with safari BODY : i have seen an issue in safari 5 browser tested on windows but the same issue happens on mac too . this happened on single radio selection multiselect: $ ' selectid' .val '' .multiselect { maxheight: 200,enablefiltering: true,buttonwidth: 220,dropup: true,nonselectedtext: 'select..', onchange: function datafield, checked { if checked { //do something }; } } ; even though it appears that no options are selected visually, if its part of a form and you serialize it with jquery, the first option value get submitted into the serialized variable. if i run a $ ' selectid' .val '' .multiselect 'deselectall', justvisible this fixes it. but i'm struggling to find a way to clear it on initialization and for some weird reason if i call this method inside the oninitialize: it screws up the select itself. did anyone face this issue in safari browser?
