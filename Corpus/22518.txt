 URL : "https://github.com/PyGenie-Scans/Scans/issues/24" TITLE : live plotting scan BODY : currently, the system does the entire scan and then plots it all at once. this is obviously the wrong approach for a plethora of reasons. each data point needs to be added as it arrives. it might be useful to also give a live update to the fits, though that will also require writing the fitting objects to know how many degrees of freedom that they have.
