 URL : "https://github.com/informatics-isi-edu/cirm-project/issues/86" TITLE : january pre-release check BODY : a list of issues i'm seeing in the pre-release check. - empty nested tables should not be _shown_ by default. they should be hidden by default. - from experiment, clicking add on a probe should take you to a record edit page to add the associative entity _not_ the actual probe entity. - from specimen, clicking add on a gene should take you to a record edit page to add the associative entity _not_ the actual gene entity. - the edit buttons such as in the actions column of nested tables for 'scan' should be disabled. - the 'add' link for 'scan' such as when it appears as a nested table should be disabled/hidden - under the admin menu of the navbar the specimen and slide menu items should be box label printer and slide label printer . - _if possible_ i would prefer that the navbar menu items open the page in the _current_ window rather than in a new window. it really clutters up the browser with lots of tabs.
