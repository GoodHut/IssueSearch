 URL : "https://github.com/rafaqz/citation.vim/issues/14" TITLE : manipulate zotero data BODY : this request is a challenge. i wonder if it is possible to extend citation.vim to directly manipulate zotero.sqlite to add or remove items, edit fields, add notes etc like you are using zotero app itself. the first problem is with this is that data corruption may result from writing to zotero.sqlite if zotero is running. what do you think?
