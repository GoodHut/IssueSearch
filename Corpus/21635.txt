 URL : "https://github.com/getsentry/react-native-sentry/issues/188" TITLE : freeze on js crash BODY : seems like after switching from raven-js to react-native-sentry, it stopped reporting crashes, but instead it just freezes the app entirely and no reports get sent to sentry, but sometimes to crashlytics. maybe crashlytics i use it with react-native-fabric is not needed anymore, since sentry handles both native and js now ?!
