 URL : "https://github.com/lh3/fermi-lite/issues/5" TITLE : bseq1_t --> fseq1_t BODY : hi heng, in trying to link bwa and fml in the same executable, i ran into an issue where bseq1_t was defined differently in each library. i ended up making a fork that fixed this issue for seqlib, but am getting some feedback that it would be better to avoid having multiple fml / bwa clones out there and instead just have seqlib link to the official fml. would you be willing to consider a pr that does the minimal amount of re-naming within fml to be able to link to bwa without multiple definition errors?
