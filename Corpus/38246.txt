 URL : "https://github.com/lukevella/Rallly/issues/29" TITLE : optimize self hosted BODY : simply put, this does not work out of the box when self hosted. it is very specific to rally.co and some changes need to be made. here are some of the things i found: 1. the from email address is hard coded to no-reply@rally.co should be set in config/main.js 2. the from name is hard coded to rally also should be set it config/main.js 3. while there is the ability to set your own sendgrid api key, it doesn't actually work because it references a sendgrid email template which is sendgrid account based. the template id should also not be hard coded. the creation of a sendgrid template should be documented. 4. docker/docker-compose support: containers are all the rage these days. this would be nice for a quick setup of rally. 5. better installation instructions. i had to jump through quite a few hoops to get it running in the first place. there is no docs on how mongodb should be configured or how to keep rally running e.g. with forever https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever . i can definitely help with some of this. i've got a decent amount of mean minus mongo experience. be expecting some prs. i love the idea of this software and i would love to use it but it needs a little work as all software does. ðŸ˜‰
