 URL : "https://github.com/gregallensworth/webpack-test-1/issues/2" TITLE : add leaflet map BODY : leaflet and our uses of it are typically a very large and complex part of this whole thing. see about loading leaflet into the mix. perhaps a more general need here, too, to load other third-party libs via cdn? we can load from cdns with a simple script tag, making our own bundle smaller and not messing with webpack. we can require the lib via a require call. maybe some of one and some of the other?
