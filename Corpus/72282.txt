 URL : "https://github.com/The-Compiler/qutebrowser/issues/2232" TITLE : bookmark load completion BODY : this is an enhancement/suggestion desired behavior : bookmark : https://syntaxdb.com/ syntaxdb - programming syntax database code :bookmark-load code list the desired bookmark as one of the valid options actual behavior : instead, i would have to query the context of the url, for example: bookmark : https://syntaxdb.com/ syntaxdb - programming syntax database code :bookmark-load syntax would result in displaying the bookmark correctly i also noticed that searching through the bookmarks doesn't support regex, ideally i would be able to search using regex for both the url and title fields of the bookmarks.
