 URL : "https://github.com/SVG-Edit/svgedit/issues/178" TITLE : more svg standard support BODY : hello there. my name is ivano arrighetta and i'm italian. i would like svg-edit to implement all of the svg standard, or almost. here are the features that are missing: text: decoration word spacing letter spacing anchor dy baseline-shift textlenght and lenghtadjust direction unicode -bidi writing mode line: stroke-dasharray stroke-linecap polyline: stroke-linejoin polygon: fill-rule transform: skewx skewy paths everything bezier curves everything elliptical arc everything grouping everything text on a path everything patterns everything animations everything - optional note those features are explained in http://www.cheat-sheets.org/own/svg/index.html unfortunately, i'm not a developer, so i don't know how to physically implement these in the editor, but i read the markup code for each feature and i guess it should be as simple as copy and paste with some more work in truth . thanks in advance for any help. bye, ivano.
