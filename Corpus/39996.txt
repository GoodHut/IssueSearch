 URL : "https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveObjC/issues/73" TITLE : swift compiler crash BODY : hi, while porting the project to swift 3 and cannot get around some segmentation faults. the scenario is the following. i have an objective-c protocol: import viewmodelprotocol.h @class raccommand; @class racsignal; @protocol listviewmodelprotocol <viewmodelprotocol> @property nonatomic, strong raccommand listitemselectedcommand; @property nonatomic, strong, readonly raccommand reloaddatacommand; @property nonatomic, strong nsarray datasource; @end which is implemented in swift as: lazy var reloaddatacommand: raccommand<anyobject, anyobject>! = { return raccommand { argument -> racsignal<anyobject> in return self.reloaddataaction argument: argument } } in the end i always get the same error: 1.	while emitting sil for getter for reloaddatacommand at /users/vmagalhaes/work/ios/nlife/nlife/viewmodels/parkingviewmodel.swift:28:14 probably this has nothing to do with reactiveobjc but any help would be appreciated. thanks in advance,
