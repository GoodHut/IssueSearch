 URL : "https://github.com/sebastienros/fluid/issues/28" TITLE : include tag behavior BODY : the include tag only writes the contents of the included file, but does not parse the file. this varies from shopify's include tag implementation http://www.rubydoc.info/github/shopify/liquid/liquid/include . the with and for syntax are also not supported at this time. at a minimum should fluid render the contents of the included file using the existing context?
