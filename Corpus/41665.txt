 URL : "https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/1844" TITLE : add block: author bio BODY : i dont know if it is already mentioned with different name. sorry if it is, be free to close issue. seems as you forgot this very fine block used everywhere. just to exclude my subjective and personal opinion about it, to state one fact. i never used it on any website done by me, not once, zero. but i see this block is very popular. wherever you turn on net, blogs, news portals, have this author bio block inside posts.
