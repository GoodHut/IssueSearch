 URL : "https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/4724" TITLE : typo in readme BODY : <!-- please don't delete this template or we'll close your issue --> <!-- before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of webpack. --> <!-- also consider trying the webpack@beta version, maybe it's already fixed. --> do you want to request a feature or report a bug ? n/a <!-- please ask questions on stackoverflow or the webpack gitter https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack . --> <!-- issues which contain questions or support requests will be closed. --> what is the current behavior? n/a if the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce. n/a <!-- a great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a github gist. --> <!-- best provide a minimal reproduceable repo --> <!-- if your issue is caused by a plugin or loader file the issue on the plugin/loader repo --> what is the expected behavior? n/a if this is a feature request, what is motivation or use case for changing the behavior? n/a please mention other relevant information such as the browser version, node.js version, webpack version and operating system. n/a i think there might be a small typo under the other backers and sponsors section of the readme. > we want to acknowledge these sponsors and backers, but donations were not public and we are not sure of donors want to stay anonymous ... should instead read, ... and we are not sure _if_ donors want to stay anonymous. just something that caught my eye. if it's too trivial, i can send in a pr and you guys can merge it at a later date along with other minor updates. /cc @bebraw because i think you're in charge of documentation
