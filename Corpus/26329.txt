 URL : "https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/NewHorizons/issues/2004" TITLE : another rotor issue BODY : which modpack version are you using? 2.0.0.0 what did you try to do, and what did you expect to happen? while browsing rotor recipes, i noticed that the recipe for making rotors in the extruder requires 5 ingots. this is more than even the crafting table recipe requires assuming optimal construction of parts . crafting table is 4.375 ingots. assembler recipe and fluid solidifier recipe both take 4.25 ingots. so the extruder is pricier than literally every other recipe. what do you suggest instead/what changes do you propose? change the extruder and fluid solidifier to require 4 ingots each. they are gated behind mv anyway, while the assembling machine recipe can be done at lv.
