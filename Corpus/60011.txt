 URL : "https://github.com/stax76/staxrip/issues/207" TITLE : vs2013 runtime version BODY : hi, just a minor thing: on every new staxrip version from you you're finding the vs2013 runtime msvcp120.dll not current, and offer a link to your version which will happily perform a repair install , but on a new staxrip it starts all over again. it would seem that you're expecting an october 4th 2013 timestamp, whereas the link you supply yields a february 10 2016 timestamp version 12.0.40649.5 on my system anyway. not really an issue but it keeps drawing my attention...
