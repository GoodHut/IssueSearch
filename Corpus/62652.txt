 URL : "https://github.com/allure-framework/allure-js-commons/issues/27" TITLE : correctly adding labels BODY : hey, great work with this project would you mind showing me the full steps to add labels? i've tried a lot of different ways and unfortunately get errors such as 'addlabel is not a function' etc. i appreciate that in the spec file we can call 'allure.addlabel severity , trival ; within the jasmine it blocks. where do we globally define allure? the conf.js file or the spec? would this just be global.allure = allure; within the onprepare that contains var allurereporter = require 'jasmine-allure-reporter' ; ? do i need to declare var runtime = require 'allure-js-commons' ? many thanks in advance!
