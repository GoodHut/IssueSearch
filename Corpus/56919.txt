 URL : "https://github.com/Codeception/CodeceptJS/issues/721" TITLE : override global within BODY : what are you trying to achieve? i am trying to override global within function to actually wait for locator element currenly it does not wait . what do you get instead? i managed to sort of workaround via extended i object like so: js module.exports = => { return actor { within context, fn { this.waitforelement context ; within context, fn ; } } ; }; however that means that instead of using global within i have to use i.within .... . i would like to do something like in bootstrap or any other place : js let withinoriginal = within; within = context, callback => { i.waitforelement context ; //how do i get i object here? withinoriginal context, callback ; }; can someone give me any example how could i achieve that? details codeceptjs version: 1.0.2 nodejs version: 8.2.0 operating system: ubuntu 16.10 protractor || webdriverio || nightmare version if related protractor 5.1.2
