 URL : "https://github.com/alexreisner/geocoder/issues/1152" TITLE : who calls cache.keys? BODY : let me start by stating i read the readme that asks not to use github issues to ask questions about usage. this is, however, more of an implementation question. a bit of background - i'm using auto-expiring cache, a slight modification of the example https://github.com/alexreisner/geocoder/blob/master/examples/autoexpire_cache_redis.rb . as the comment says, i have keys method in the cache that simply delegates to redis.keys . i figured i could make this more efficient by utilizing the geocoder prefix; there is no need to bring in all redis keys. while this change was easy to do, i had trouble testing myself because i couldn't locate who in the geocoder code calls the cache.keys method.
