 URL : "https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/issues/917" TITLE : await in parameters BODY : following on from this thread https://twitter.com/pemrouz/status/831157518302867456 , just creating this issue to help nudge discussion forward. based on various comments, it seems doable but requires spec changes first. clearly the following lines need to be removed, but how exactly the parsing logic needs to change to accommodate this is less clear to me: > 26. if kind is generator , then > if parameters contains yieldexpression is true, throw a syntaxerror exception. > > 27. if kind is async , then > if parameters contains awaitexpression is true, throw a syntaxerror exception. potential syntax variations for discussion: await just default value js async function foo bar = await baz { } await param, not just default value: js async function foo await bar { } await param, with default value js async function foo await bar = baz { }
