 URL : "https://github.com/StrangeLoopGames/EcoIssues/issues/2905" TITLE : cart linking exception BODY : i had this same issue as well as my server being completely non-functional now after the cart caused it to crash. i made the cart, put it in my inventory, chose a place to put it and as soon as i clicked to place it i was ejected from the server. the server runs on my home network so i looked at it and it was at the console, having crashed. i restarted the server but it simply crashed again and will not start up now. ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/774628/33283638-48fc7af4-d361-11e7-8e3a-38f302994fe8.png
