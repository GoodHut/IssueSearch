 URL : "https://github.com/XENON1T/pax/issues/602" TITLE : s1 patterns binning issue BODY : i found that the s1 per-pmt map has a binning issue around z=0 . the current map is generated with only 10 bins in z which causes the aft map to have a continuous lxe/gxe transition instead of having a hard cut at the gate. therefore i improved the binning of the map increased the number of bins to 60 before interpolating and extrapolating. i tried to test this new map with the following command and the montecarlo scripts which seems to not be successful : fax+pax run-dependent configuration fax_pax_config= waveformsimulator truth_file_name=\ ${fax_filename}\ ;diffusion_constant_liquid=${diffusion_constant} cm 2 / s; default drift_velocity_liquid=${drift_velocity} um / ns;electron_lifetime_liquid=${electron_lifetime} us;s1_patterns_file=\ /scratch/althueser/kr83m-new/processing/montecarlo/xenon1t_s1_xyz_patterns_aug2017.json.gz\ ;s2_mean_area_fraction_top=63.23 the s1 aft still looks like on this wiki page https://xecluster.lngs.infn.it/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=xenon:xenon1t:sim:notes:althueser:xe1t_msc_mc_perpmt comparison-of-mc-v0.2.1/v0.3.0-with-new-binning . so i don't know if there is still an issue in fax or if the new map wasn't loaded an thus the map look equal. you can also see in the link how i generate the pax map https://xecluster.lngs.infn.it/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=xenon:xenon1t:sim:notes:althueser:xe1t_msc_mc_perpmt convert-to-pax-format . i also miss an option in fax which logs the used map or an indicator which tells me that a specific map was used .. could we upload the new map to cvmfs pax v6.8.0 and test it there with the mc scripts? do you have a better idea?
