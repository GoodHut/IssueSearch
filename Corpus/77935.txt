 URL : "https://github.com/andreww/pvt_eos/issues/3" TITLE : other equations of state BODY : currently the code only fits the 3rd order bm eos. it would be nice to give a range of different eoss to fit to. it may be worth using sympy to implement this using symbolic algebra to transform between the f=f v form and p=f v form. this should be simple, and if this is in place adding all functions and even letting the user set the functions should be a doddle.
