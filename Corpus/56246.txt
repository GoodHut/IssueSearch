 URL : "https://github.com/dsmjs/dsmjs.github.io/issues/36" TITLE : mixed content warnings BODY : now that we are serving the site over https, we have some mixed content warnings that we need to deal with. looks like they are coming from the fonts loaded by tikly tiklet_ticket_show:15 , tiklet_ticket_show:1 mixed content: the page at 'https://dsmjs.com/' was loaded over https, but requested an insecure stylesheet 'http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=lobster|open+sans:300italic,400italic,300,400&subset=latin,latin-ext'. this request has been blocked; the content must be served over https. @crolek happen to know if there are any knobs on tikly to handle this?
