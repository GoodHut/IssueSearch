 URL : "https://github.com/benchflow/benchflow/issues/116" TITLE : build the faban-manager BODY : the faban-manager is a service written in java using the dropwizard framework that: - interacts with faban to deploy, run and undeploy trials; - streams to clients registered to dedicated apis, logs and stats for specific trials. the streaming api has to read once from faban for each trial, and stream to all the registered clients. candidate design pattern: http://www.journaldev.com/1739/observer-design-pattern-in-java, https://dzone.com/articles/design-patterns-uncovered3 @jeppe-style: since i will need to test the integration of this service, with a mocked faban , as well as the actual faban-harness , where can i find in the documentation the guidelines, and link to examples on how to do so in a java project. resources: - streaming: https://dzone.com/articles/jax-rs-streaming-response, https://github.com/nikom1337/dropwizard-stream-api, https://nbsoftsolutions.com/blog/turning-dropwizard-performance-up-to-eleven.html. @jeppe-style do you know about other solutions to implement the same, maybe with http2?
