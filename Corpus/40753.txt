 URL : "https://github.com/dustball/gping.io/issues/30" TITLE : user device deletion BODY : needs to mark a device as no longer valid for positional data. we should be able to delete in two ways 1. delete but retain data i.e. soft deletion; this will retain the device location data but will mark the object as deleted for the purposes of receiving new data probably means new bool in user_devices table 2. delete and purge data is straight forward and should just remove the device and all positional data associated with that id. blocked until 21 is complete since we need to know what is necessary to delete existing data.
