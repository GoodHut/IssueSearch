 URL : "https://github.com/openaddresses/openaddresses-ops/issues/18" TITLE : rename attribution name BODY : in sources like ch/basel-stadt.json https://github.com/sergiyprotsiv/openaddresses/blob/186174b73c89d53c75fc9dcf7b9f58cf0007e49e/sources/ch/basel-stadt.json : we state that the source needs attribution, and provide the recommended credit text with a confusingly named property called attribution name : attribution : true, attribution name : geodaten kanton basel-stadt , this config was originally added in https://github.com/openaddresses/openaddresses-ops/issues/7. i propose we renamed attribution name to something like attribution-text to remove the space and make it clearer that the this is the text the source requires not just the proper name of the source . because the recommended text is sometimes crazy long, doesn't fit in constrained layouts it's probably also useful to specify the source name in a clean way with something like source-name . attribution : true, attribution-text : geodaten kanton basel-stadt , source-name : kanton basel-stadt , referencing http://www.geo.bs.ch/geodaten/nutzungsbedingungen.html where they indicate the required cc-by attribution text is geodaten kanton basel-stadt . sources with the older attribution name syntax should be upgraded either with this issue or with a followup issue in openaddresses/openaddresses https://github.com/openaddresses/openaddresses/issues/new . there are also cases where attribution required might be legally false , but we'd still fill in attribution-text &/or source-name as a curtesy.
