 URL : "https://github.com/Yoast/wpseo-news/issues/306" TITLE : improve the utc notice BODY : functionally the check to see if we need to display the notice is based on an empty timezone string. we need to expand this check to also include any utc and utc+? strings. any hardcoded utc date will not include any daylight saving logic and will be off half of the year in daylight saving regions.Â  contextually the current copy states: your timezone settings should reflect your real timezone, not a utc offset, please change this on the general settings page. your real timezone is not very descriptive and is not helping the user to determine what it should be set to. suggested copy: the timezone this website is configured for should reflect the country or region you are based in. you are currently using an utc offset, which will not take daylight saving into account. you can change the timezone settings on the general settings page. this should be signed off on during acceptance testing
