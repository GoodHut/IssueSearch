 URL : "https://github.com/renesansz/discord-greeter-bot/issues/34" TITLE : bot gets the boot BODY : every time i run the bot, it immediately gets disconnected. it doesn't even connect first, it just flat out goes to the disconnect function to make sure it wasn't my mistake, i created a new project file, and went through the tutorial again. twice all the files are exactly how they are from the tutorial, and i even tried tokens from multiple bots. i even gave the project file to a friend on his computer, and it did the exact same thing. thank you for your time.
