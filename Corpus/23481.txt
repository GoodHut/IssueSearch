 URL : "https://github.com/DmitryUlyanov/neural-style-audio-torch/issues/3" TITLE : porting to pytorch BODY : i tried porting the code to pytorch, specifically the tensorflow version. the latter works perfectly. but with pytorch when i use optim.lbfgs, i run into exploding gradients/no updates on the target. the error is in the update: 151 152 update scale of initial hessian approximation --> 153 h_diag = ys / y.dot y y y 154 155 compute the approximate l-bfgs inverse hessian zerodivisionerror: float division by zero i am running this on cpu only for the time being - macos 10.13.1 64 bit. any insights on why this may be happening?
