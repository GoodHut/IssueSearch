 URL : "https://github.com/boostorg/python/issues/99" TITLE : add indexing operators BODY : thanks for moving forward with this work. my usage is often porting c code to use with python. in that case, the c code expects containers that are indexable. i can often convert to using ndarray that is, https://github.com/ndarray/ndarray , using pretty simple mechanical translation. these codes expect to index into arrays. without indexing operators, i don't think the current version is useful here.
