 URL : "https://github.com/kubernetes/heapster/issues/1565" TITLE : other types of sources? BODY : hello, not an issue per-se but rather a question to which i can't seem to find any answer. is heapster able to read metrics from anything else than cadvisor? api-server, etcd and kube-dns maybe others expose prometheus like /metrics and i wanted to know if these are fetchable using heapster? thanks for the great work guys!
