 URL : "https://github.com/KSP-RO/TestFlight/issues/165" TITLE : add rcs failure modes BODY : currently, the only failure mode applicable to rcs thrusters is exploding. it would be nice if they had slightly less dramatic ways of failing. in principle, rcs thrusters can have most of the failure modes experienced by main engines, including i<sub>sp</sub> loss, thrust loss, shutdown, and at least for bipropellant thrusters like the stock vernor engine ignition failures. i'm not sure if cooling failures make sense.
