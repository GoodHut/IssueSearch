 URL : "https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy-webpage/issues/6" TITLE : navbar show active page BODY : currently the navbar doesn't show the active page. e.g. here about in the navbar isn't highlighted: https://rawgit.com/robertazanin/gammapy-webpage/69c5a1625b60e2e45adb93ce6c95faf3ce3942cd/about.html example of what we want: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/ there in the navbar examples is highlighted. we want this, but ideally set up in a way so that a variable is defined in the head of each page saying which nav item is active, e.g. below <title>gammapy - about</title> this would then be easier to maintain, because for a navbar change one can then still simply copy & paste the whole navbar between the different html pages we have. adding the active attribute directly in the navbar code is error-prone, quickly leads to copy & paste errors.
