 URL : "https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/738" TITLE : time dependent smesolver BODY : hi all, currently we are working on a time depended version of the sme solver. there is a strategic decision to be made. at the moment, the stochastic.py file is the second largest file in qutip due to variety of methods involved. so it is a kind of mess. we think it make sense to create stochastic_td.py to contain all the related time depended cases for solvers etc. should we do it or is it better to keep enlarging the stochastic.py file?
