 URL : "https://github.com/plone/training/issues/280" TITLE : error with ng --build BODY : @ebrehault when i ran ng build --prod i got this error: module not found: error: can't resolve './$$_gendir/app/app.module.ngfactory' doing ng build --env=prod instead, fixed it for me. i didn't do any of the version upgrades recommended in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42718095/module-not-found-error-cant-resolve-gendir-app-app-module-ngfactory, though they might be a good idea. i have @angular/cli : 1.2.3 , for what it's worth.
