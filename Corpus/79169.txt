 URL : "https://github.com/algolia/sup3rS3cretMes5age/issues/8" TITLE : running locally - errors BODY : i followed the installation guide and i keep getting errors. i want to contribute to front-end part... running command go get just get stuck for some time and then there's nothing to install, and running go run .go allows me to run it locally, but then hashicorp vault does not seem to work. it throws an error in network post request when i try to submit message and since i don't know go-lang it's either problem with it, with a docker or with this project itself. i wish if i could provide more detailed errors, but i uninstalled everything and tried multiple times and then ended up getting rid of everything as i was unable to make it work. steps i had to do before following the guide in readme: > install go via homebrew brew install go > add some go related variables into my .zshrc and update the path gopath=$gopath goroot=/usr/local/opt/go/libexec path=$path:$gopath/bin path=$path:$goroot/bin > add given vault variables vault_addr=http://localhost:8200 vault_token=$ docker logs vault | grep token | awk '{print $nf}' > install docker via homebrew-cask brew cask install docker > ran given command for hashicorp vault _ assuming _ for docker docker run -ti --cap-add=ipc_lock -ti -p 8200:8200 --name vault vault > and of course final steps bash cd ~/sites git clone https://github.com/algolia/sup3rs3cretmes5age.git cd sup3rs3cretmes5age go get go run .go and of course then as i described, i keep getting some errors. i can install go and docker again if you could help me to resolve this issue more easily?
