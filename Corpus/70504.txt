 URL : "https://github.com/onur/docs.rs/issues/144" TITLE : weirdly sorted searches BODY : for example, searching for seahash https://docs.rs/releases/search?query=seahash has fxhash as top result, but seahash only appears in its benchmarks. i presume it is because the last version of fxhash is newer than the last version of seahash, but it is clear that the exact matching search should take precedence over the other ones.
