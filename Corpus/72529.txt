 URL : "https://github.com/kieranjol/IFIscripts/issues/176" TITLE : camera rush sip creation BODY : something like sipcreator.py path/to/card1 /path/to/card2 this will wrap all cards into a logs/objects/metadata structure. ideally it takes a final argument, -m which is the manifest. script should be smart enough to figure out how to find the original checksums of the cards, pluck them out, validate the new directory structure with those existing manifests and creating a new one in the process or something like that i don't know if i'm making any sense it's almost home time and i just love the sound of my own typing
