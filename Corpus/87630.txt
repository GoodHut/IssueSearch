 URL : "https://github.com/mozilla/addons/issues/424" TITLE : looking for webextensions BODY : don't know where to put this so...it would be nice if you put in a search feature for addons that will be compatible with ff 57 and above. the only one i can find is when you do a keyword search. then you can use tabs. otherwise you have to go through all the addons in a category to find one that may work. what happened? what did you expect to happen? anything else we should know? please include a link to the page, screenshots and any relevant files.
