 URL : "https://github.com/jeregrine/jsonapi/issues/76" TITLE : not compatible with tesla BODY : hey, i'm trying to use this library for parsing jsonapi data that i fetch from an external api. i couldn't find a proper example for this so i tried this myself. elixir defmodule jsonapi do use tesla plug tesla.middleware.baseurl, www.example.com plug tesla.middleware.headers, %{ authorization => hidden } plug jsonapi.queryparser def get do get /asset-types/locomotives/ end end the issue is that tesla has 3 arguments for plugs, and jsonapi only expects 2. is there any chance for a tesla compatible plug for requesting json? or is there a better way to parse json requested from external api without phoenix
