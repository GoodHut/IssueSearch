 URL : "https://github.com/perfsonar/pscheduler/issues/444" TITLE : test iperf 3.2 BODY : bruce wrote an email saying that he thinks he has a version of iperf3.2 that is worth testing currently at master branch in git . from the note.... 1. we fixed a bunch of mostly minor statistics and reporting bugs. mostly these affected the human-readable output, but one change that affects the json is that at least for tcp tests, the statistics for each end of the test should be consistent and correct across both the client and server. we still have this problem for udp, in that we sometimes use a mishmash of sender-side and receiver-side numbers to compute some things, and it's not necessarily easy to fix. in theory this shouldn't be a huge difference in the reported values. 2. it should be possible to connect from iperf 3.1 to iperf 3.2 and vice versa i already fixed one bug in this area . 3. i imported a recent cjson, mostly for bugfixes they've been doing a lot of work the past 6 months or so . in my testing so far this works about the same as what we had before and i hope that the rest of perfsonar sees it the same way. 4. the new authentication feature requires openssl it's auto-detected at compile-time . i haven't decided whether to adjust the rpm spec file to now make openssl a dependency for iperf3 or not. right now i'm kind of +0 on this. mostly because it's likely the build machine will have openssl on it for other reasons, so if we auto-detect, the binary rpm package will pick it the dependency anyway. your input would be appreciated.
