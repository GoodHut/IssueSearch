 URL : "https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/1296" TITLE : nsis artifact name BODY : <!-- which version of electron-builder are you using? --> version : 14.1.1 <!-- which version of electron-updater are you using if applicable ? --> <!-- what target are you building for? --> target : nsis - win32 & win64 <!-- enter your issue details below this comment. --> i'm trying to create two executables with nsis one for windows 32bit and one for windows 64bit, i'm able to create both fine, however they both export to the same filename causing the first one create to be overwritten. i thought using artifactname in build.nsis would solve the problem, however the arch variable doesn't seem to be working. any ideas what i could do to get a unique filename for each build, or what i'm doing wrong with the artifactname property? thanks <!-- if you want, you can donate to increase issue priority https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=w6v79r2rgcchl -->
