 URL : "https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java-tools/issues/75" TITLE : support generic types BODY : what are your thoughts on adding support for generic types? our current problem is pagination and the fact we need to copy paste a lot of the same code because it's not supported at the moment unless we're overlooking something? . if we ever want to change our base connection type, we would have to change a lot of code just because generics isn't supported. this issue was raised here as well: https://github.com/facebook/graphql/issues/190. basically the same use case, but it's still open. they did mention that the js version of graphql-tools supports a way to have the connection and edges generated for a specific type: type mytype { hello: string world: string } ${ connectionandedgefor 'mytype' } in my opinion this should be supported in some way, preferrably as pure generics, because that gives a lot more flexibility for other use cases as well. then we could do something like: type connection<t> { pageinfo: pageinfo! edges: edge<t> totalcount: int nodes: t } type edge<t> { node: t cursor: string! } is this something that could be added to the library?
