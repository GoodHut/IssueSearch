 URL : "https://github.com/Propaganistas/Laravel-Phone/issues/69" TITLE : storing in database BODY : what would be the correct way to store phone + country code in db? currently thinking to seperate country_code and phone_number $table->string 'phone_country_code' ->nullable ; $table->string 'phone_number' ->nullable ; however, brings me to questions such as: - what about unique validation? if this is separated into two columns it would be harder to validate. - fetching a user by a provided phone number would be a bit more difficult than simply doing ->wherephone $phoneno how are you guys storing?
