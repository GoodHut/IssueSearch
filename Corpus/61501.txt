 URL : "https://github.com/danielo515/TW5-EncryptTiddlerPlugin/issues/12" TITLE : avoid double encryption BODY : when using batch encryption by filter, you can by mistake double encrypt a tiddler. and if you are distracted do it over and over again, so you dont know how many times you have to decrypt a tiddler. would it be possible to have some option to only encrypt non-encrypted tiddlers? and make that the default? a checkbox a custom filter is a less elegant option my case: i think i have encrypted a single tiddler at some point in time. then i have re-re-re... encrypted that with the batch mechanism, so i am in practice locked out of that tiddler.
