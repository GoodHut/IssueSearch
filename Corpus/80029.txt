 URL : "https://github.com/brianshumate/ansible-consul/issues/87" TITLE : support upgrading consul BODY : i noticed that when i change the variable consul_version and run the script on an existing consul cluster that each nodes still states the old consul_version in consul members . when i checked on the machine i noticed that the binaries were not upgraded to the specified consul version. the main issue i found is the check for existing consul binary task inside the file task/main.yml https://github.com/brianshumate/ansible-consul/blob/443d4a5f18c0f00c636d3e5576fd887a4a25e14e/tasks/main.yml l57 . with the guide from consul at https://www.consul.io/docs/upgrading.html i hacked together something that is not idempotent and uses a variable called consul_install_upgrade . this bypasses the stated check and runs additional tasks such as systemctl daemon-reload on ubuntu. i think further restructuring of this hack is required to ideally make the process idempotent. so my questions: is it planned to support upgrading consul via the ansible role?
