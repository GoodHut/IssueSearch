 URL : "https://github.com/DistributedDesigns/Milestone1/issues/5" TITLE : log to a file BODY : the logging package https://github.com/op/go-logging is cool and can have multiple backends attached to the same log. i want to have my variable level console log and log all debug info to a timestamped file. this implementation gist _feels_ like it's right but it doesn't work. it can create the file but never writes anything to it. if i keep the code as-is and swap out os.stdout it logs as expected. ðŸ˜ž gist : https://gist.github.com/trstephen/e00c7832f59a1ff7b8dbcce7717e9e66 file-patch-diff-l62
