 URL : "https://github.com/sebastienros/yessql/issues/41" TITLE : native poco persistance BODY : hi, i like yessql after toying around with it. particularly, the philosophy of it as database interface if the feature could let us target native poco persistence, it further adds value to the developer & the performance of the underlying system. there are many applications, like image galleries, maps, networks, where this is much much faster. i am attaching some links/samples behind the idea - and the speed realized. 1. benchmarks http://bit.ly/2ohevou 2. code on github with samples http://bit.ly/2opakye 3. intro https://velocitydb.com/
