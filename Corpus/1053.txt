 URL : "https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements/issues/718" TITLE : fn to hyper BODY : love the original karabiner, but missing the ability to map the fn key to a hyper cmd+ctrl+shift+alt combo. i was wondering how i might accomplish something similar with karabiner elements, or else if this feature can be added?
