 URL : "https://github.com/elmsln/elmsln/issues/1864" TITLE : support for xapi recipes BODY : having seen the recent work with beacons and xapi. i wondered whether the next step to make things more interoperable is to include support for xapi recipes. for example, should the triggering of a beacon support the 'attendance' recipe? described here http://tincanapi.com/new-recipe-attendance/ and actual recipe here https://registry.tincanapi.com/ profile/48 there's a whole registry of activity types, verbs, profiles etc. https://registry.tincanapi.com/ that can be used when doing custom stuff.
