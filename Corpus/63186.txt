 URL : "https://github.com/IBM-Swift/BlueSocket/issues/102" TITLE : detect close_wait state BODY : in my project i'm using kassandra https://github.com/ibm-swift-sunset/kassandra , which uses bluesocket. i was testing my project that is using kassandra, after establishing the initial connection. when i stop the cassandra service, in xcode i see the connection state changing to closewait , but socket doesn't represent it. in other words, when connection state is closewait , socket returns true to isconnected, isactive and islistening. my question is, is this an expected behaviour and if so how can i detect the closewait state.
