 URL : "https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/198" TITLE : use shared build targets BODY : instead of using redundant settings for each project .csproj files , use shared build targets that can easily be imported by an <import> tag. see my repo: root/build https://github.com/janosjanka/partnerinfo/tree/master/build/targets - import: project file https://github.com/janosjanka/partnerinfo/blob/6e682594964ae077263e56d0e3c240d19a429383/src/partnerinfo.core/partnerinfo.core.xproj l3 xml <import project= ..\...\build\targets\partnerinfo.dotnet.props /> 1 i experienced a better/faster solution load by removing a bunch of redundant code from my projects and putting them into shared build targets. 2 you can easily change architectures for all projects in one place.
