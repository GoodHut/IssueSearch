 URL : "https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets/issues/685" TITLE : build error on ubuntu BODY : i'm getting this error and lots of others like it when building master on ubuntu 16.04: make 1 : entering directory '/home/username/dev/uwebsockets' g++ -std=c++11 -o3 -i src -shared -fpic src/extensions.cpp src/group.cpp src/networking.cpp src/hub.cpp src/node.cpp src/websocket.cpp src/httpsocket.cpp src/socket.cpp src/epoll.cpp -s -o libuws.so in file included from src/websocketprotocol.h:5:0, from src/websocket.h:4, from src/group.h:4, from src/group.cpp:1: src/networking.h:14:22: error: expected identifier before numeric constant define msg_nosignal 0 ^ i think the error is caused by this recent change to the ifndef test for msg_nosignal: https://github.com/unetworking/uwebsockets/commit/836b5993ee0dc92637f3c029a029d3e2176d2c75 i think this needs to be moved to somewhere after the include <sys/socket.h> for it to pick up the pre-existing msg_nosignal.
