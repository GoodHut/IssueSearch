 URL : "https://github.com/dmlc/ps-lite/issues/76" TITLE : sarray is buggy BODY : include ps/sarray.h int main int argc, char argv { ps::sarray<int> sa1{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}; ps::sarray<int> sa2 sa1 ; sa1.pop_back ; std::cout << sa1.size << std::endl; std::cout << sa2.size << std::endl; return 0; } outputs: 8 9 sa1 and sa2 should be the same, i think, by design. but size_ and capacity_ are managed separately, it is a bug.
