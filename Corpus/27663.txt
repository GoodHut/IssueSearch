 URL : "https://github.com/MichaelScript/Athena/issues/18" TITLE : double scroll bars. BODY : sometimes two scroll bars one for the body and one for the content div appear. the navigation bar should remain up top of the screen and the content panel should be the only area where you can scroll. i.e: the nav bar should take up the top 5% of the screen at all time and the content should take up 95%. you should only be able to scroll in the content section not on the entire body. the scrollbar should also if possible remain invisible when not being scrolled.
