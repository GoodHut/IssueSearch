 URL : "https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DiffEqBiological.jl/issues/10" TITLE : higher order terms BODY : in relation to https://github.com/juliadiffeq/diffeqbiological.jl/issues/1 & my own issues when testing a simple model, i am not sure https://github.com/juliadiffeq/diffeqbiological.jl/pull/7 is entirely correct. for a true, stochastic, second order reaction with 2 molecules of the same species reacting with each other the reaction rate is k u 1 u 1 -1 / 2!, and not k u 1 u 1 -1 . in the case of 3 molecules the rate would be k u 1 u 1 -1 u 1 -2 / 3!. this is because the number of ways of pairing 2 molecules of the same species using binomial coefficients is u 1 ! / 2! u 1 -2 ! . for n molecules this generalizes to u 1 ! / n! u 1 -n ! . this is a key difference between deterministic and stochastic kinetics. they apply these corrections in the previously mentioned article, http://stochpy.sourceforge.net/html/userguide_doc.html stochastic-rate-equations, although without explaining where the constant 0.5 comes from. likewise the constant 1/6 in the 3rd order example 3 comes from the factor 1/3! there is more information in the original gillespie papers e.g. eq 6a in http://www.phys.ufl.edu/~hagen/readings/gillespie_1977.pdf
