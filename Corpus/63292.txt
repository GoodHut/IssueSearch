BODY : @xiangzhou i'm wondering if there is much benefit to including the force_float option in gemma, which makes your code somewhat more complicated. you claim that this option is useful for reducing memory requirements, but have you tested this? most computers now have 64-bit architectures, which means that addressing is limited to 64 bits, which is the size of a double-precision floating-point number. in other words, a single-precision floating point number will also occupy 64 bits.
