 URL : "https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/4850" TITLE : make test names optional BODY : test names should be optional. i know i can put an empty string, but it would be nice not to have to write it at all. rather than needing to write a name for each test, some people may prefer not to have names and rather just refer to the failing test in the code itself when something fails.
