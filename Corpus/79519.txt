 URL : "https://github.com/htmlburger/carbon-fields/issues/324" TITLE : simple file upload field BODY : i'm not sure that this is a feature request i may try to make my own field , but more of a request for comment. i feel like i'm over-thinking this. i have a need for a field that allows me to upload a file. however, i do not want them uploaded to the media library there will be several files, and i don't want them to clutter up the library. i also don't want wordpress to rename existing for this deliverable. basically, i'd like a input type=file where i can: set allowable mime types i know that this is already doable with the file field type . this actually isn't a big deal, but would be nice. ability to set a destination path ex: uploads/my_plugin/ ability to specify whether an existing file of a matching name should be _overwritten_ with the newly uploaded version, or if the new file should be _renamed_ ex: my_file-1.zip . in my current need, i _do_ want them to be overwritten with the new file because of external links. for my purposes, i would be fine without having the option to choose as long as the file was not renamed. this upload field must work in a complex field this may make using the hook mentioned below tricky?? i could probably make a custom field type using the template, but perhaps it would make more sense to just ->set_attribute 'type', 'file' ; and then do the rest of the work with carbon_fields_{container_type}_container_saved ? am i missing some caveats? a very crude & ugly example: <img width= 702 alt= carbon-field-file-upload src= https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8184361/29878781-0734fec2-8d69-11e7-8130-3c0e44f9c17d.png > i should have labeled the upload file button as browse , since the url shown would be the previously -uploaded file url - available for copy/paste - and not the actual file that is to be uploaded thank you for ideas, daniel
