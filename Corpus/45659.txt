 URL : "https://github.com/jfroelich/rss-reader/issues/426" TITLE : improve url rewriting BODY : currently this only modifies google news urls, but i plan to include more misc notes: rewrite_url is the public api, but it should be delegating the one rule it applies right now probably to a separate function or something like that, so that it becomes easily extensible. or maybe an array of rule objects or something. i have to consider the behavior when multiple rules match the input. i have to consider whether i want to rewrite as a chain, where i sequentially apply any rules. maybe even various url normalizations, like removing hash, is just another kind of rule.
