 URL : "https://github.com/jonthornton/Datepair.js/issues/103" TITLE : bower being discontinued BODY : hi, since bower is being discontinued, i would suggest adding the yarn as the package manager. yarn add datepair.js or even npm npm install datepair.js the reason i ask this is because i started receiving error messages and warnings and had to migrate the bower modules to yarn on prod. we can avoid this hassle by simply using yarn or even npm from the start. the same is true for timepicker as well.
