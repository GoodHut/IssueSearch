 URL : "https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/3517" TITLE : feature request: json feed BODY : it would be nice to have json feed https://jsonfeed.org implemented in hugo. > the json feed format is a pragmatic syndication format, like rss and atom, but with one big difference: itâ€™s json instead of xml. > > for most developers, json is far easier to read and write than xml. developers may groan at picking up an xml parser, but decoding json is often just a single line of code. > > our hope is that, because of the lightness of json and simplicity of the json feed format, developers will be more attracted to developing for the open web.
