 URL : "https://github.com/drtshock/PlayerVaults/issues/259" TITLE : 1.8.8 confirmed dupe BODY : steps to replicate: 1. put some nice items you want more of into a pv 2. throw an enderpearl a bit far away far enough so you can type in the playervault command 3. open vault immediately after throwing enderpearl 4. on land, take the item out and close the vault 5. re-open playervault spigot 1.8.8 playervaults v3.5.6-b181 i am unsure if you're still supporting the 1.8 builds, but a fix would be greatly appreciated. i assume this can be prevented by giving a warm-up on the /pv command, but that is not desirable
