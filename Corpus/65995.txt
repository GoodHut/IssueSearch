 URL : "https://github.com/Wynncraft/Issues/issues/7255" TITLE : loot crates + scrapping BODY : you can not scrap 5 godly rewards, it says you do not have 5 of the tier. this is not true though, i put in five of the same tier normally it gives me a higher tier. godly should prob give me godly. @ascendedkitten closed my original issue calling it a feature request, but its not. as stated on that post i asked a mod juicedbananas a while ago and they told me it should be possible. also if you activate a disguise, weapon skin, or attack effect then scrap them, they are not deactivated. disguises on relog, but the rest donÂ´t reset original post: 7246
