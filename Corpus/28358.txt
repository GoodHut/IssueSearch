 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/sqlopsstudio/issues/249" TITLE : fr: hot key for run BODY : - sql operations studio version: 0.23.6 steps to reproduce: i select a table, right click and select select top 1000 . i then make a change to the query generally adding a where clause then i want to run the new query and i have to reach for the mouse to go click the run icon in the toolbar. i don't want to have to reach for the mouse, i want to hit a key to run the query again. the hot key should be something like ctrl-r on windows and cmd-r on the mac. don't use f5 - thats too hard to use on laptops that require a fn key to enable the function keys instead of the other functions laptop vendors attach to those keys.
