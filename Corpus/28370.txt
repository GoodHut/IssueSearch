 URL : "https://github.com/Frege/frege/issues/325" TITLE : frege on the dotnet BODY : hello @ingo60 since the last time i was experimenting with frege i've absolutely come to enjoy using the language - thanks for sharing this awesome work! the thing is i'd like to port it to the new dotnet-core being worked on by microsoft in the open, but unfortunately i don't see the original java source for this purpose. or perhaps there's a work-around to that which enables me to have frege haskell on the dotnet as well?
