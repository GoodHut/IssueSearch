 URL : "https://github.com/ben174/bart-crime/issues/2" TITLE : parse report id BODY : at the end of every log entry is a string of numbers followed by an l and at most 2 digits, i.e. 1708-0313 l24 . 1708 expands to 2017-08 or august 2017 year/month that crime occurred i believe 0313 is the report number for that month, starting at 0000. some reports are not made public for unknown reasons which is why the number skips. i believe that the l24 identifier specifies the location area or station that the crime took place at. i haven't yet found a way to map an identifier to a specific location.
