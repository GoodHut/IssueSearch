 URL : "https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-core/issues/658" TITLE : picroft pairing issue. BODY : it seems that a fresh install of picroft can have some trouble pairing.the time i did it required that i reboot a couple of times to get updates and to get it working. it did seem to pair the first time but picroft didn't think it was paired. i deleted the device and tried to re-pair and i found it wouln'd accept the code. the code hadn't changed. after a reboot and update it seem to show up as paired and seems to work. but i don't have the device on home.mycroft.ai because i deleted it from before.
