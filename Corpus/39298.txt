 URL : "https://github.com/sirjuddington/SLADE/issues/631" TITLE : saving without nodes BODY : slade version : 3.1.2.alpha operating system : linux issue details : there should be an option to save without building nodes. i need to hit save, click cancel, click ok, wait a second, then exit slade with another click ok. at several times per minute this can get tiresome. related and still an issue, i am now using an entirely different linux distro. http://mancubus.net/forums/index.php/topic,3321.0.html i also like saving without nodes anyway, i have several megawads in a zip at 1mb. none of the maps are saved with nodes.
