 URL : "https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15858" TITLE : before destroy hook BODY : description it would be great to have a feature to execute a provisioner before a server instance is destroyed. use case say, i have a queue events handler which one should be upgraded to a new instance kind: resource aws_instance consumer { ami = ${data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id} instance_type = t2.nano } replacing with resource aws_instance consumer { ami = ${data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id} instance_type = t2.small } after planning and applying changes terraform should replace it by removing the old instance and creating a new one. so as not to corrupt something that a worker currently working on i go to the server, send usr1 signal to tell my worker to stop accept new messages, then i wait until all jobs are done and after that i safely replace my old instance. the first thing that occurred to me about how the feature could be implemented is: lifecycle { before_destroy { provisioner remote-exec { inline = echo 'abandon ship!!' } } }
