 URL : "https://github.com/robbiet480/Seville-MQTT/issues/1" TITLE : decoding raw codes BODY : i have been looking at the raw codes in attempt to decode them. i am finding that these are not simple nec style although they use the same preamble,0/1 bit,postamble structure as nec and they are much longer than 32bit possibly 64 bit codes . would it be possible for you to capture some of the raw ir signals for other features like the wind mode and the sleep timer ? i only have the fan, so i cannot capture them myself. thanks
