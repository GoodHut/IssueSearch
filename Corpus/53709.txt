 URL : "https://github.com/arrilot/data-anonymization/issues/3" TITLE : error in set generator BODY : when i set the generator faker with another locale i want to use nl_nl it is allways replaced by the default one: public function setgenerator $generator { if $generator !== null { $this->generator = $generator; } if class_exists '\faker\factory' { $this->generator = factory::create ; } return $this; } better would be to add a check if the given generator is null
