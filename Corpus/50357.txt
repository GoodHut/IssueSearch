 URL : "https://github.com/mertenats/Arilux_AL-LC0X/issues/30" TITLE : ws2812 aka neopixels? BODY : i have a few of these and i'm likely to buy more... i also have a bunch of esp8266 units of other flavors. hooking up a ws2812 strip to them is easy enough and either bit banging or faster ways of pushing pixels have been found, lots of github repos with code but i'm wondering if they could be made to support ws2812 as well. from https://www.muzik.ca/2016/11/30/hacked-esp8266-rgb-led-controller/ a 5v source is available at the ir, and there is at least one more data line available it seems. neopixels need 5v, ground, and data. depending on method used, data line can vary... i2s output pin is the same as rx1 pin 25 , and the i2s method is fast... see https://github.com/cnlohr/esp8266ws2812i2s does the above mean that potentially, an arilux could be wired to drive neopixels too, at worst needing a breakout of the rx pad combined with the ir cable?? if so, anyone interested in trying this out and seeing if it's worth adding support for this... essentially making it drive an addressable strip with full mqtt/ota/etc firmware?
