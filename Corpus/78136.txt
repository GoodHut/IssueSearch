 URL : "https://github.com/astroconda/astroconda/issues/66" TITLE : pip install into channel BODY : under additional software considerations it seems i should be able to pip something which is unavailable with conda directly into a channel: $ source activate astroconda $ pip install <name_of_pkg> when i do this it does not solely update the channel, but the root distribution. is there anyway to pip specifically to a channel and not affect the entire distribution?
