 URL : "https://github.com/xJeebsx/WoolenHUD/issues/1" TITLE : hud broke for some reason BODY : so im playing the usual pub, than i realize that my screen is different. i have the abcd loadout text on my screen going down, i can no longer use fast weapon switch because whenever i press 1 it gives me the error sound, and i have to scroll down on my mouse to change weapon, this heavily effects my gameplay and i wish for it to be fixed. -maestro
