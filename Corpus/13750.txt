 URL : "https://github.com/xogeny/ModelicaBook/issues/397" TITLE : yarn build fails BODY : i tried to generate the site locally using make site but get the following error: docker run -v pwd :/opt/mbe/modelicabook -w /opt/mbe/modelicabook/generator -i -t mtiller/book-builder yarn build yarn run v1.3.2 $ debug='mbe: ' react-static build { error: cannot find module './json/_static/sponsors/sponsors.json' ... looking for sponsors.json i find it in the following locations relative from the modelicabook root: modelicabook/apps/public/_static/sponsors/sponsors.json modelicabook/sponsors/sponsors.json modelicabook/text/build/dirhtml/_static/sponsors/sponsors.json none of which resided under a json dir where yarn seems to look for it. so i'm puzzled whey it works for you @mtiller.
