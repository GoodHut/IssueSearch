 URL : "https://github.com/mevdschee/php-crud-api/issues/174" TITLE : limit the request globally BODY : welcome! already, thank you for sharing your script, it is really useful to me. here is my question: is it possible to limit the request for output of the api globally let me explain, i understood that it was possible to limit the pagination like this: /files?order=id,desc&page=1,10 but without the limitation of the pagination, the script returns the totaliter of the table and with more than 10 000 to enter in bdd it is complicated to manage so is it possible to globally limit the number of requests to the page call?
