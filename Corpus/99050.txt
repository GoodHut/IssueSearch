 URL : "https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr-node-client/issues/176" TITLE : make a snap stable release BODY : i've been using and enjoying the tldr snap for some weeks already. it seems pretty stable to me, so why don't you make a release to the stable channel? bonus points if you add an icon and a screenshot in https://dashboard.snapcraft.io, because then it will also appear on searches on the gnome software app. install tldr with one click! : expected behaviour sudo snap install tldr should give me the most recent stable release of tldr. snap find man pages should show tldr in the results searching in gnome software should show tldr in the results. actual behaviour tldr is only installable from the edge channel. environment - operating system - ubuntu 18.04
