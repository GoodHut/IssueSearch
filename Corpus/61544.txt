 URL : "https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Pi-Finder/issues/72" TITLE : bad option to /bin/ping BODY : the -o option to ping in ping.js seems to be a typo. like, the wrong type of o. should be capital -o . when i run /bin/ping at the command line with small -o, it fails with an error message. i assume, then, that the spawned ping for linux and maybe mac in ping.js has also been failing. couldn't figure out the build enviroment to test myself though.
