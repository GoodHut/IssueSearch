 URL : "https://github.com/donejs/donejs/issues/1037" TITLE : ssr zone epic BODY : done-ssr 1.2.0 includes new zones that bring the power of ssr out of its internals and exposed so that people can use them directly. note that this might be part of another project eventually. in working on an ssr react presentation it was decided to change the api for incremental rendering, so that the user doesn't have to call a reattachment function. this changed the api, so a few things need to be updated.
