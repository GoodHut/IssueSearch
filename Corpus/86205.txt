 URL : "https://github.com/marmelab/admin-on-rest/issues/974" TITLE : handling of 403 forbidden BODY : the docs on authentication state that: > upon receiving a 403 response, the admin app shows the login page. this is wrong isn't it? my understanding has always been: anon tries to access restricted page ? is user authenticated? no? => 401 unauthorized should be: unauthenticated user logs in as 'john' john tries to access restricted page ? is user authenticated? yes, as 'john' does 'john' have permissions? no? 403 forbidden meaning: unauthorized sending to a login page is only sensible if the user is not logged in yet. if 403 is returned, it means the user is logged in, but still not allowed access. he should first log out and then log in as a different user .
