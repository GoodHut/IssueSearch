 URL : "https://github.com/gotk3/gotk3/issues/180" TITLE : compile error on arm BODY : when i compile my application on an arm platform with the 1.8.3 go compiler with the actual version of gotk3 i get the following error: ../../github.com/gotk3/gotk3/gtk/print.go:1502: type 1073741824 c.struct__gtkpagerange larger than address space ../../github.com/gotk3/gotk3/gtk/print.go:1502: type 1073741824 c.struct__gtkpagerange too large it seems that the array size of 1 << 30 is too big on arm platforms. the question here is nonetheless why such a big value is used here. on amd64 paltform everything is ok.
