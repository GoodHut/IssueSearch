 URL : "https://github.com/urish/firebase-localstorage-fix/issues/1" TITLE : out of date? BODY : this looks like a solution for safari private that is breaking firebase authentication, but since there's no commit history i can't easily reason with how to cherry pick this code into a more recent firebase build.. what changed in this repo to fix auth with disabled localstorage ?
