 URL : "https://github.com/performant-software/Annotation-Studio/issues/117" TITLE : improve csv export BODY : - when annotations are exported in a csv file, the body of the annotation is html, which is not readable for teachers who just want to see what students have written - html does have benefits, including formatting, media embedding, links, etc. - perhaps there should be a rendered , in-browser view, and/or an option to export as csv with markup stripped out, even if that removes some information
