 URL : "https://github.com/knewter/time-tracker/issues/5" TITLE : upgrade to elm 0.18 BODY : i notice that most of the libraries in this example have been updated since the tutorials were written. is there any interest in updating to a newer version of elm? i want to do the mdl tutorial track on daily drip but also want to learn the newest version of elm. i'd be up for giving it a shot.. most of the problems i'm running into seem to revolve around not really understanding the navigation library. anyway, just thought i'd gauge interest and see if anyone else would find that useful.
