 URL : "https://github.com/clemdesign/grav-plugin-language-selector/issues/2" TITLE : dropdown menu invisible BODY : the button displays in the upper right corner of the page. by selecting the button the dropdown is not opening. in html code all elements are available and by disabling the build-in css the button plus the dropdown menu is visible and functioning. an error message says 'user-select' declaration unknown and ignored. it looks that there is an issue with the js-code.
