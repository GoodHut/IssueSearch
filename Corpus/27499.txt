BODY : hi @xingyizhou, thanks for providing this awesome project, however, i found that the demo.lua code seemed to not working properly, when i tried to execute the script, i got: inconsistent tensor size, expected r_ 32 , t 32 and src 2 to have the same number of elements, but got 32, 32 and 2 elements respectively looks these lines of code incurred the problem, especially, the variable p returned from getpreds with size 1,1,32 , which crashed by p 1 j :add diff:sign :mul .25 | local output = model:forward inp:view 1, 3, inputres, inputres :cuda   | local tmpoutput = output output - 1   | local p = getpreds tmpoutput   | local reg = output output   | local z = reg + 1 outputres / 2   | local pred = torch.zeros j, 3   |     | for j = 1, j do   | local hm = tmpoutput 1 j   | local px, py = p 1 j 1 , p 1 j 2   | if px > 1 and px < outputres and py > 1 and py < outputres then   | local diff = torch.floattensor {hm py px+1 -hm py px-1 , hm py+1 px -hm py-1 px }   | p 1 j :add diff:sign :mul .25   | end   | end   | p:add 0.5 i'm not quite familiar with lua as well as torch, so pls have a look.
