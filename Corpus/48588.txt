 URL : "https://github.com/bcgov/wqbc/issues/73" TITLE : set data <mdl to mdl? BODY : as the ems database and likely eccc database has a lot of data below mdl, setting all that data to zero as wqbc is currently set-up looks weird on a plot and in presenting it in a table. if the data was set to the mdl, it could be presented in a table with the result letter column, illustrating the 'minimum' value was less than the mdl, as opposed to showing up as zero. possible for the user to do this with tidy_ems_data ? i can't tell from the documentation.
