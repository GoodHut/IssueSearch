 URL : "https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold/issues/282" TITLE : crossref doi integration BODY : dois we store the following dois in manifold: 1. project landing page => dataset 2. project all resources page => dataset 3. resource => component 4. text landing page => book published text or posted content provisional 5. textsection => article umnp will likely not assign dois to textsections, provisional texts, and individual resources, but other texts may. 1 and 2 will be assigned when the project is created other dois will be manually triggered by backend users. for example, when a text is ingested, the backend might prompt the user as to whether or not she wants a doi to be created. manifold will need a mechanism to synchronize its doi locations with crossref. assigning/saving dois will need to be an idempotent process that can be run multiple times. build this as a service with an adapter that is cross-ref specific in case someone in the future wants to integrate with another vendor. terence will give me sample dois for each object so i know how to structure them. zach will produce sample xml for each request and share it with the crossref representative before proceeding with development.
