 URL : "https://github.com/plotly/dash-table-experiments/issues/5" TITLE : scroll bar removal BODY : i'm not sure if this has been done somewhere, or if it's related to row_scroll_timeout , but it would be good if there a way to edit the height of the table or remove the vertical scroll bar in the table, i.e. have it span across x rows rather than a set amount or a set height
