 URL : "https://github.com/Samuell1/contenteditor/issues/25" TITLE : no file name error BODY : in the documents, i can't determine if a blank file name is acceptable. but when trying to save a page with no file name listed, i get an error saying .en is not a valid extension. the plugin injects the .en automatically and causes it to fail. when declaring a file name, this error doesn't appear. wanted to clarify this issue and ensure it's not a bug, and if it is that it can be fixed. thanks! and i really appreciate all of your hard work!
