 URL : "https://github.com/emorynlp/nlp4j/issues/27" TITLE : how to properly use nlp4j BODY : hi, i added the nl4j dependencies to my maven project then created the following test almost a copy of nlpdemo.java : string configfile = src/main/resources/config-decode-en.xml ; nlpdecoder nlp4j = new nlpdecoder ioutils.createfileinputstream configfile ; nlpnode nodes; string sentence = john bought a car for mary. ; nodes = nlp4j.decode sentence ; system.out.println joiner.join nodes, , 1 + ; the system completed a run in 53 seconds , so i'm wondering what i've done wrong to make it run so slowly. is there a proper way to use nlp4j to get this? note that i'm only interested in the dependency tree at the moment, which i'd preferably get as an object, so that i can later use it in my application. thanks!
