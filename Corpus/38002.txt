 URL : "https://github.com/mydzor/chip-arch/issues/4" TITLE : no boot after reboot BODY : thanks so much for this script. it works awesome with the addition from the 2 issue. after the flashing, everything is fine, i see the ttyacm0 connect to it with screen , everything is peachy. the issue happens when i reboot it. i do systemctl halt , disconnect the chip, and when i reconnect it to the pc, there's no ttyacm0 anymore. no ssh connection although it was set before the reboot. and in dmesg i only see : usb 1-2: new full-speed usb device number 20 using xhci_hcd any ideas what can be wrong ?
