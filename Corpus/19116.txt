 URL : "https://github.com/Marchowes/pyProm/issues/57" TITLE : write saddle walk BODY : i'll bet this will be harder than i think. in a nutshell: -create lookup hash for summits -iterate through high edges of saddles. -start with the highest neighbor. -iterate over neighbors, going to the highest of the set -keep track of points or not? -do this until no higher neighbors. this by law is a summit. -look at hash lookup, find what summit it is. -add to saddle linker -if two points meet at the same summit and only two high edges, then saddle is disqualified. might become complicated with ponds.
