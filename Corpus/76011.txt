 URL : "https://github.com/schroenser/youtube-uploader/issues/4" TITLE : improve progress logging BODY : at the moment, progress for bigger uploads is logged like this: main info de.schroenser.youtube.uploader.loggingmediahttpuploaderprogresslistener - upload percentage: 0.006280595500679352 at lease - the number should be a readable percentage and not a value between zero and one. - a real percentage value needs at most 2 fractional digits. perhaps we should even reduce it to one. - only log if there is an increase in the visual part of the upload percentage. nice to have - try to access the number of bytes uploaded and calculate the kb/s or mb/s. - this would need some kind of smart formatter, that chooses the best human readable unit based on the actual value. - take the file size into account to calculate an eta based on the remaining bytes and the current upload speed.
