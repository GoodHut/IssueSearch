 URL : "https://github.com/MarkXA/ddrmenutemplates/issues/4" TITLE : ulrazor template bug BODY : line 15 of the ulrazor.cshtml should be corrected to this: <li @classstring> otherwise you get a nested class= within the class assignment itself and completely throws off any hope of accessing those classes in your css. i made the fix in our production environment and it's working great. thanks! ryan
