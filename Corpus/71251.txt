 URL : "https://github.com/jrsurge/SuperDiffuse/issues/15" TITLE : add an interleaving tool BODY : because superdiffuse uses interleaved files, it would be useful to have an interleaving tool to produce them. this would require: - a way to open the tool button or shortcut? - a way to specify to add multiple mono files - a way to remove mono files - a way to change the ordering in case we need to it might be nice to also provide a soundfileview? this might be dangerous given current issues - might need to wait until after the peaks file is completed, or be added later
