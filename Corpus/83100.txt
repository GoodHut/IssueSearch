 URL : "https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/issues/339" TITLE : btn always returns number BODY : btn returns a bitfield of all the buttons pressed, so up = 1, down = 2, left = 4, left+up = 5, up+left+down = 7, etc. which is all well and good, except btn n returns the same bitfield but limited to that one button. so btn 4 returns 16 when a is held and 0 otherwise. is that the intended behavior? because the wiki says btn n should return true when held, not a number. if this is the intended behavior, then the wiki could use some updating. i primarily use javascript if it matters. i just realized that lua might treat >= 1 as true, which would make the wiki _technically_ correct in a way. if this is how it's intended to work, do you mind if i edit the wiki? i've noticed some other minor inaccuracies and missing information too. i've been toying around with tic-80 allot lately, so i'd be happy to clean the wiki up a bit while i'm at it.
