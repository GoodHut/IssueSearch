 URL : "https://github.com/kodeine/laravel-acl/issues/207" TITLE : looking to make updates BODY : hello. i am looking at using this package as our primary acl and wanted to start helping with some things and checking if other updates were ok. 1. update to 5.4. i am currently seeing what all needs to be changed to get this working on 5.4 since there are a lot of method name conflicts with base laravel now. i should have these done soon. 2. configurable table names. i personally prefer to call the tables acl_ or rbac_ . would it be ok to make the table names configurable in the config file with your current names set to the default? example would be rbac_roles , rbac_permission_role , etc. it could either be every table listed out or just the option for a prefix to be applied. mihght have more questions soon, but wanted to get this to you and start the conversation.
