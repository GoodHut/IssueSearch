 URL : "https://github.com/bonprix/vaadin-coverflow/issues/5" TITLE : online demo unavailable BODY : the online demo as advertised on the vaadin add-on description as well as in the readme document in the repository point towards http://bonprix.jelastic.servint.net/vaadin-coverflow-demo/ but there is only a 502 error waiting for you. this add-on is very well crafted. many thanks for that! and once the underlying libraries, i.e. flipster, is updated, so that the outstanding issues are resolved, it is a great addition to any vaadin project that can make use of it. it sure is worth being boldly presented :- cheers, and many thanks for your efforts
