BODY : i can't get the library working on an esp32 lolin. i see that esp32 is in the .h files. but for some reason it's not working. here's an excerpt of the errors. esp32 is defined, because if i try to define it it says i'm redefining it. no idea how to solve it. > > compiling .pioenvs/lolin32/frameworkarduino/hardwareserial.o > in file included from /home/myuser/.platformio/lib/encoder_id129/encoder.h:46:0, > from src/main.cpp:7: > /home/myuser/.platformio/lib/encoder_id129/utility/interrupt_pins.h:202:2: error: error interrupts are unknown for th > is board, please add to this code > error interrupts are unknown for this board, please add to this code > ^ > /home/myuser/.platformio/lib/encoder_id129/utility/interrupt_pins.h:205:2: error: error encoder requires interrupt pi > ns, but this board does not have any : > error encoder requires interrupt pins, but this board does not have any : > ^ > ^ > /home/myuser/.platformio/lib/encoder_id129/utility/interrupt_pins.h:206:2: error: error you could try defining encode > r_do_not_use_interrupts as a kludge. > error you could try defining encoder_do_not_use_interrupts as a kludge. > ^ > in file included from src/main.cpp:7:0: > /home/myuser/.platformio/lib/encoder_id129/encoder.h:61:11: error: 'io_reg_type' does not name a type > volatile io_reg_type pin1_register; > ^ > /home/myuser/.platformio/lib/encoder_id129/encoder.h:62:11: error: 'io_reg_type' does not name a type > volatile io_reg_type pin2_register; > ^
