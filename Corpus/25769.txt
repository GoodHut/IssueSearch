 URL : "https://github.com/mozilla-services/hawkauthlib/issues/3" TITLE : add aiohttp support BODY : it would be nice to add native support to http://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/client.html so utils.normalize_request_object works out of the box in aiohttp based clients. i don't think it's a big deal to have this code synchronous withing an async client. signing the request is mostly cpu-bound . cc @rpappalax
