 URL : "https://github.com/metzge-ka/Raspbian/issues/1" TITLE : support for mtw devices BODY : in my current project, i have to use a raspberry pi 3 rpi with the raspbian os version: jessie . also some xsens mtw2 sensors up to 6 have to be connected to the rpi and the goal will be to record all sensor data to a sd card. at first i tried to use predefined software from xsens, such as the mt manager, the xsens device api and accompanying example code. but, it tourned out that it is not possible to use this on the rpi, because of the arm architecture full linux support according to the xsens homepage . that's why started to use ros with some node xsens_mti_ros_node-master, which is supposed to work. the node provided by xsens does not work with the mtw2 sensors... then i was happy to find the original author/maintainer of the ros node: http://wiki.ros.org/xsens_driver url starting the node and calling the config of the mtw2 sensor as follows, seems to work - more or less - with the mtw2 sensor, but the inspection stops there and we don't get the full configuration: $ roslaunch src/ethzasl_xsens_driver-master/launch/xsens_driver.launch and then: $ ./mtdevice.py -b 0 -v -i the output from the mti compared to the mtw suggests that something is wrong see attatchment . many thanks to francis colas the original author of the node . mti mtw.docx https://github.com/metzge-ka/raspbian/files/716970/mti.mtw.docx
