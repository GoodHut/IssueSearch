 URL : "https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneyeos/issues/1299" TITLE : adjusting iso etc BODY : i noticed when using motion eye os in fast network camera mode, it's possible to adjust iso etc and get much better low light images/video. this option doesn't seem to be available when using motion eye os in standalone normal mode, is there any way to achieve this? thanks simon
