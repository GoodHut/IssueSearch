 URL : "https://github.com/opentable/oc/issues/582" TITLE : cli interactive mode BODY : inspired by this tweet https://twitter.com/cpojer/status/891040413435473920 and this pr https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/commit/549dbe8a5c8bd5c81e2dade4d3413bd40260148f to create-react-native-app and obviously jest. i think it would be very nice if the registry when starting, would have some sort of interactive mode. perhaps a command to rebuild the component and one to toggle the verbosity level
