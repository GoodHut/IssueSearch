 URL : "https://github.com/runmyrobot/letsrobot_ios/issues/32" TITLE : ios exclusive features BODY : apple love apps that use features that they've created, and they will feature your app more in the app store if you have said features. understandably being featured by apple is a big deal and it'll drive a lot more people towards the app who may have never seen it before. features that apply to us and can be used in some way: - support for multi tasking split view, slide over, etc - fully universal app full support for both tablet and phone - ✅ 2+ os compatibility - drag and drop images could be dragged to fill out avatar fields - peek and pop preview robots -  pay purchasing robits, exclusive control, etc - imessages app better sharing of robots with nice imagery, stickers pack with robot images as a whole this is fairly low priority but it would definitely be nice to have!
