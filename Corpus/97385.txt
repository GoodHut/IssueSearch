 URL : "https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/3932" TITLE : github mirroring is broken BODY : changes exported to gob no longer appear on github. a commit was made directly to the github repository 1 by clicking edit on the readme and merging directly . since then, new code changes exported to gob 2 no longer appear on github. @damienmg i am looking for guidance on this one - i am not sure how the mirroring to github works. would it be sufficient to delete these two commits from the github repository by force pushing to it, and then gob changes will sync again? 1 https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/2eeaa153e481f771dda12e282690a2e7966ba390 2 https://bazel.googlesource.com/bazel/
