 URL : "https://github.com/segmentio/conf/issues/4" TITLE : personalize help output BODY : it would be awesome if we can personalize the -h output. i m in the case where i want to specify a command as parameter. e.g. gomac build -name myprog gomac run -v i can retrieve the command with the result of conf.load but if i don't find the command i want, i would like to print the help with a customized header like: unknown command. usage: gomac build | run -h -help options... options: ... // the rest of the option output. have a way to set the usage would be nice.
