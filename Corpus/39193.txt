 URL : "https://github.com/OpenOrienteering/mapper/issues/984" TITLE : rfc: flatpak package BODY : sometime ago mapper has been mentioned on fedora's mailing list as package request. as there is no point in duplicating effort across distributions, i prepared a simple manifest for flatpak here https://github.com/flathub/flathub/pull/105 . now, as i'm not using mapper myself, i'd love to get some feedback from you â€“ is there anything that should be changed from your point of view? would you be willing to co- maintain it with me? after standalone repository is created, every commit is automatically build so it's rather straightforward to provide new releases to linux users.
