 URL : "https://github.com/wikkawik/WikkaWiki/issues/1244" TITLE : docker hub image wikkawiki BODY : @klenwell @bakoontz, the current docker image on docker hub is on my personal repository, but @klenwell build a very good image. i created a new organization on docker hub and invited to @klenwell to play and be owner too. the idea is make a official image. i propose as goals of this docker hub organization: - make a official wikkawiki docker image. - make readble/hackable script. - with automatic build. - working out of the box build on a default tag. note: with the sqlite driver, we only need a web server running into the docker, we can remove the use of supervisord from the wikkawiki versions upper 1.4.0
