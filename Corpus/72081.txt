 URL : "https://github.com/vlachoudis/bCNC/issues/551" TITLE : autolevel issue with g91 BODY : autolevelling has a problem with g91 mode relative coordinates . it splits up movements assuming g90 mode absolute coordinates resulting in too long travels. for example, consider the following g-code straight line of 10 mm : g91 g1 f200 x10 bcnc splits this up into the following segments: g91 g1x0y0z0.031f200 g1x5y0z0.025 g1x10y0z0.019 clearly this is wrong as it leads to a 5+10=15 mm movement in the x direction. it should be 5+5=10 mm. ps: i am using bcnc version 0.9.8
