 URL : "https://github.com/jbdemonte/node-p7zip/issues/3" TITLE : 7z file not encrypted BODY : hello, running your demo is working fine, but i wanted to generate a password protected file and i add this parameter on switch .add 'test.7z', ' .js', 'p123456789' but i don't know if this is correct. but on your source code i saw that args are being added at the end, but for encryption that parameter does not have to be added at the end. example: 7za a -pmy_password archive.7z dir1 that is why i think it is not working. could you please check that? best regards,
