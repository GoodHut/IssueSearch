 URL : "https://github.com/nicehash/NiceHashMinerLegacy/issues/631" TITLE : cannot locate amd gpu BODY : i've done extensive research on this issue and have found nothing that works. i am currently running two amd rx vega 64s, and an rx570. i've updated the drivers to the latest version, downgraded to 15.something, hopped around driver versions, and tried disabling and reenabling the cards in device manager. nhml finds the cards when i disable and then re-enable, but it says i cannot use them something is wrong with the card and that i should restart. upon restarting, i'm back to square one. i've tried nhml 1.8.1.5 and 1.8.2.0. it detects the cpu just fine. any other tips? i've installed all of the drivers for my motherboard. ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33811645/32994029-c1d1c78e-cd1e-11e7-9554-c83cfeff180e.png ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33811645/32994034-d4ef57dc-cd1e-11e7-8b7f-e3f860b336b0.png
