 URL : "https://github.com/engintron/engintron/issues/542" TITLE : nginx won't start BODY : we have one server where nginx fails and won't restart, we have to remove and reinstall, this has happened twice. we have installed this on several of our servers, the other problem we run into is clients can't access via ssl after install, the only solution we found is we switch the port back to 443 from 8443 so their sites will respond. the logs show a lot of conflicts after install on port 443.
