 URL : "https://github.com/ruby-hyperloop/hyper-mesh/issues/38" TITLE : class method missing quirk BODY : i can reproduce this behaviour in our work app but i can't reproduce in a minimal app which isn't very helpful. the snippet causing issues: ruby class todo < applicationrecord phony_normalize :title, default_country_code: gb actually missing def self.foo error foo end end and then todo.foo in a component. the phony_normalize method isn't available on the front end fine but the error i actually get is runtimeerror: todo.foo called class method missing . which is unhelpful in tracking down what's actually wrong. but as i said i can't reproduce, sorryi; when i try in a minimal app i do get the error pointing to phony_normalize . i don't know how opal would be able to partially compile the class in some cases even though it can't find bits. or could hyper-mesh be doing something odd? todo: test again when hyperloop works with opal 0.11 as that might fix it
