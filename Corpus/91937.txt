 URL : "https://github.com/DarrenZLew/FantasyFitness-1.0/issues/2" TITLE : usability of form buttons BODY : what's wrong? the form buttons are difficult to use on a touchscreen. what do i expect to happen? they should be easy to select. they should take up a minimal amount of space in order to make the scoreform quick to use, but they should also be spaced out enough that the user won't risk clicking on the wrong exercise often. suggested fix play around with their size. play around with their borders/margins. test on a touch-screen. supporting information
