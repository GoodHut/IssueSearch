 URL : "https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elasticsearch/issues/662" TITLE : to_s in the wrong place BODY : the https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elasticsearch/commit/f3c4895897cb93303fe58132ff186ea8dbb0c465 patch to fix a url sanitization error may have applied the to_s too late in the method call chain. instead of doing .sanitized.to_s , we should probably do .to_s.sanitized , no? weird that the unit tests didn't catch this one.
