 URL : "https://github.com/Laverna/laverna/issues/785" TITLE : fix portuguese translation BODY : hey @wwebfor, you did a small bad translation: you put: pt_br : { name : portugisch brasilien , nativename : portugisch brasilien }, i fixed instead: pt_br : { name : portuguese brazil , nativename : portuguÃªs brasil }, and a brazilian translator forgot of switching from windows iso to utf-8 for the file brazilian portuguese translation.json because before, it appeared with dirty characters in laverna when you switched to portuguese. i am going to drop two files for you: brazilian portuguese and locales https://github.com/laverna/laverna/files/1149872/portuguese.zip
