 URL : "https://github.com/csharpfritz/Fritz.EpicBuildMusic/issues/9" TITLE : concurrent build issues BODY : > sat idle having seen a tweet about upcoming stream - decided to have a scan of the code so apologies for tedious stuff i'm not sure if relevant, but solutions with multiple entry points or orphaned dependency trees will typically run in parallel. could this line cause a concurrency issue under those circumstances? https://github.com/csharpfritz/fritz.epicbuildmusic/blob/master/fritz.epicbuildmusic/buildmusicpackage.cs l192 would a interlocked.increment ref int location https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd78zt0c v=vs.110 .aspx be more appropriate?
