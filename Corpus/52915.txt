 URL : "https://github.com/python/typeshed/issues/1768" TITLE : creating pymongo stubs BODY : i've been working a fair bit with pymongo lately and thought it would be nice if there were stub files available. there currently exists a rather basic and seemingly introductory attempt at making pymongo stubs at https://github.com/mongodb/deluge/tree/master/server/stubs/pymongo. as i said these seem like a work in progress and don't really cut the mustard for any real use. unfortunately, the folks at mongodb have issues disabled on the pymongo github repository https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-python-driver so i don't have a good way to get their insight into whether this is something they want to handle internally or not. as such, i went ahead and created stubs for all of the modules in pymongo for my own personal use. however, i'm sure there are some rough edges that would need smoothing before sending it out into the world. i'd be more than happy to make a pull request for this, but wanted to follow the protocol before doing anything rash.
