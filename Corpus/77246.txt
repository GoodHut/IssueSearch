 URL : "https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/3113" TITLE : move spider to an add-on BODY : move the traditional spider to an add-on. main reason to move it is that it allows to release enhancements and bug fixes sooner and more often no longer requires releasing a whole new version of zap . no core functionality depends on the spider. existing add-ons that extend the spider e.g. custom parsers/filters will have to be changed to depend on the new add-on e.g. for proper un/installation .
