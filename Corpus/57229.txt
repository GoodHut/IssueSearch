 URL : "https://github.com/praat/praat/issues/513" TITLE : praat for command mode BODY : i have been using an old version of praatcon.exe for the command mode. i want to upgrade it to the latest version. i have noticed that there is no separate version for the command mode. but i am having some difficulty to open this from the c . i was using below code for older version. var info = new processstartinfo @ c:\praat\praat.exe , c:\praat\run.praat { workingdirectory = @ c:\praat\ , useshellexecute = false, redirectstandardoutput = true, redirectstandarderror = true, redirectstandardinput = true, createnowindow = true, }; process.start info ; there is extra command --run in the new version of praat to run in the command mode. but i could not figure this out. is the new version compatible with c ? please provide me sample code for c if you have any.
