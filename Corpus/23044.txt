 URL : "https://github.com/ngnjs/ngn-core/issues/12" TITLE : ngn.data date type BODY : dates are complicated enough to warrant special processing. they can be received in all manners that aren't technically js dates, and they often need conversion to a locale, utc, or gmt. these types of fields should be supported, with as much automatic detection as possible. when something cannot be parsed into a proper js date, make sure a warning event is triggered.
