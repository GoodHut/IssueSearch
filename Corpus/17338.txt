 URL : "https://github.com/paulackerman/SmalyukhSharedCode/issues/7" TITLE : orientation of s2 BODY : hey guys, here is a good one to check and fix... i have added a wiki page which includes some test code. i am not sure if the orientation of s2 points, all for phi = 0, agree with the preimage visualization! i suspect that we have s2 rotated by 180 degrees or something like that. can you check this and report back with your preferred definitions of theta and phi? i hope to make the s2plotter consistent with fvisualizepreimages! -paul
