 URL : "https://github.com/plinth666/epsonsimplecups/issues/11" TITLE : rpi3 pdf printing issue BODY : hi there, i am using your driver to print pdf files on the epson_tm-t88v printer from the rpi3 but the margins and the fonts are somehow different when printing from windows 7 and the cutting is not right. i am not sure if this is so because this driver is not fully compatible with the t88v printer or if i am missing something. the printing is working fine when using esc/pos commands and raw javax.print methods but when it comes to pdf printing, something is not right this is maybe also an issue how the raspberry is creating pdf files . ppds are also not helping when modifying the printer driver. if there is a way to create a full cups driver for tm-t88v like you did for the tm-t20, or if you have some advice how to do this, i would appreciate if you or somebody else could help me with this matter. thanks! deki
