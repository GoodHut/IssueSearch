 URL : "https://github.com/RRZE-Webteam/FAU-Techfak/issues/26" TITLE : conflict with wpcf7 plugin BODY : hello, i discovered an issue when using the theme with the wpcf7 plugin with a recatpcha authentication: the following filter, starting in line 2031 leads to an error of the recapchata function: add_filter 'the_content','remove_empty_p',20,1 ; function remove_empty_p $content { $content = force_balance_tags $content ; return preg_replace ' <p>\s + <br\s / > ?\s </p> i','',$content ; } besides the regular recaptcha field, a second field appears. the second field normally is wrapped in a noscript-tag, thus it is only shown, if no scripts are activated. however, in the output code, the noscript-tag is empty, wrapped in a <p> , and the code that should be in the noscript is in an <div> after the <p> . the issue is caused by the $content = force_balance_tags $content ; line. is this function necessary and if, how can the transformation of the noscript-blog be avoided , or can the function be commented out like in the following filters? best regards markus brandmeier
