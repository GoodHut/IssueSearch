 URL : "https://github.com/sminster/csm/issues/5" TITLE : windows headers files BODY : the windows makefile does not also include the headers as the linux version does . to include the headers it looks like the makefile needs to be updated as: all: $ headers $ library and shell install:: $ rm $ instdir /lib/$ libname .so $ cp $ library:%.dll=%.lib $ instdir /lib $ cp $ headers $ instdir /include/csm though i am not 100% sure? if those are correct, i am happy to open a pr with the changes. i do not have immediate access to a windows build env. to test.
