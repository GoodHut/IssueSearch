 URL : "https://github.com/modwizcode/time-tracker/issues/3" TITLE : add support for databases BODY : this would be useful in making this a tool that other's could find practical uses for. making it as simple and clean as possible is a defined goal should support a vast range of databases for easy integration, allowing users to avoid having to add a new database if one is already used thoughts so far: database access in c++ sounds messy, not overly hard, just messy enough to confuse the code should wrappers be used or go native to c style interfaces? leaning towards wrappers on this project
