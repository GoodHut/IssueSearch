 URL : "https://github.com/jennybc/reprex/issues/56" TITLE : reprex keyboard shortcut? BODY : i'm not sure if this is a double up of 28, but i was thinking it would be really nifty to make a keyboard shortcut, so you could highlight some code, and then do something like cmd + shift + r and it would copy the text, then run reprex? thank you for writing a package i use almost every day!
