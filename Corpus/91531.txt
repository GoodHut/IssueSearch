 URL : "https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility/issues/372" TITLE : turn into python package? BODY : hi all, as you may know volatility has been a plugin for cuckoo sandbox for a couple of years now. however, users need to install it manually due to the fact that it's not a python package i.e., it's not on pypi and as such you can't pip install volatility it . are there any plans to start releasing it up there at some point? thanks!
