 URL : "https://github.com/LPM-HMS/COSMOS2/issues/59" TITLE : all licenses mentioned BODY : the project seems to be licensed under a number of conflicting licenses depending on what source of information is used: setup.py says the project is under an mit license license says it's a gplv3 license website http://cosmos.hms.harvard.edu/ in the faq says the project is apache 2.0 licensed. these should probably all say the same thing.
