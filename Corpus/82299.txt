 URL : "https://github.com/brainagency/ruby-sonar-plugin/issues/3" TITLE : add rubocop rules support BODY : in ruby community there is a very handy and widely used tool which is called rubocop https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop . this tool check ruby code by following community-driven conventions which are ruby-style-guide https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide and rails-style-guide https://github.com/bbatsov/rails-style-guide . actually rubocop contains more than hundred of useful rules, so it will be very worth to have all of them in the sonarqube, because all of sq plugins for ruby have a lack of rules.
