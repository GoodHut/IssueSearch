 URL : "https://github.com/hoburg/d8/issues/31" TITLE : advanced debug method BODY : i liked the idea of writing a debug method that branches down and runs the subsystems independently. i think a big decision is how to handle surrogate models. for example, we'll need a stand in tail model to run the fuselage in debug. one option is to simply pass in the answer from the final solve as fixed values. thoughts?
