 URL : "https://github.com/CorralPeltzer/newTrackon/issues/5" TITLE : reset uptime values? BODY : how long does the uptime record of a tracker last for? it seems like it's indefinite? imo it should expire uptime records that are older than one or two months. yes, it's good to know how stable a tracker has been over an extended period, but it is not a good metric. let's compare two theoretical trackers: > tracker 1: has 100% uptime but not many torrents on it because it is newer > tracker 2: has <95% uptime due to some hardware issues, but has been around for longer and has millions of torrents tracked in the current good list , tracker 2 won't be included even though it's a much more beneficial tracker to add to a torrent client.
