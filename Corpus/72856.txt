 URL : "https://github.com/akvo/akvo-rsr/issues/2611" TITLE : check french translation BODY : in the latest french translation there were a couple of strings that may be translated incorrectly, and we might check this with the translator. it's the translations for lock period https://github.com/akvo/akvo-rsr/blob/b733d759ed89abcbb019ba2fb65325eb7a4d620e/akvo/locale/fr/lc_messages/django.po l8127 and unlock period https://github.com/akvo/akvo-rsr/blob/b733d759ed89abcbb019ba2fb65325eb7a4d620e/akvo/locale/fr/lc_messages/django.po l8131 . it seems to me that they are translated as locking duration and unlocking duration or similar. but the meaning of the wording are the actions lock the period and unlock the period .
