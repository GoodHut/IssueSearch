 URL : "https://github.com/DocNow/diffengine/issues/31" TITLE : smarter stale measure BODY : the current test for staleness https://github.com/docnow/diffengine/blob/master/diffengine/__init__.py l97-l125 doesn't seem to be smart enough. after running diffengine for over a month it is taking it 8 hours to check breitbart, the guardian and the washington post. i think it needs to be smarter about what to do with the backlog of sites. perhaps randomly sampling from them?
