 URL : "https://github.com/BastiaanOlij/LensDistortion/issues/2" TITLE : adjusting the fov BODY : right now the frustum and basic parameters are calculated initially as if the lens does not distort. when applying the lens distortion coefficients the resulting images is correctly distorted for the lens and while the fov stays very small the end result should be fine. using the upscale parameter you can increase the fov, you'll see that more of the surrounding image is rendered. for instance, upscale factor 1.0 no upscale with k1 = 0.1 and k2 = 0.1 we get: <img width= 1136 alt= upscale factor 1 src= https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1945449/25182319/91f718d0-2557-11e7-9452-ff159aab1a4f.png > increase the upscale factor to 2.0 and we get: <img width= 1136 alt= upscale factor 2 src= https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1945449/25182347/a6b9bec6-2557-11e7-8ff9-22254397e868.png > we should be able to use the constants to determine the optimal upscale value. one problem with the upscale is that we should be increasing the resolution of our viewport_left and viewport_right viewports not of our lensmaps or things will get blocky but there is a bug in godot 2.x preventing us from doing so. we also render far more then we bargain for, a lot of pixels rendered to our viewports are lost when we start increasing the fov due to the lens effect. striking a good balance becomes important.
