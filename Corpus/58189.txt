 URL : "https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/10078" TITLE : script crowdin updates BODY : the source of truth for all language translations files except english is in crowdin https://translate.rancher.com . syncing them with the git source is currently a manual pain. add a scripts/update-translations to the ui repo which uses the crowdin api, cli, and/or docker preferably, instead of installing stuff to: - upload the current copy of en-us and zh-hans if you want to start managing that as first-class language inside git from local to crowdin - create a build of the updated approved translations - download the build - update the appropriate files in translations but don't touch en-us - bonus points: print out how many keys are awaiting approval assume $crowdin_api_key is set in the environment, and ping me on slack for credentials.
