 URL : "https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull/issues/709" TITLE : empty and clean jobs BODY : hi, i'm using bull in my node.js application. it works good, but sometimes appears issues with repeated jobs especially on application restarts. in my case one or more repeated job don't runs. i've found that i can fix this by clearing redis flushdb and restarting application. then everything works good. so i've decided to clean all queues on application start. i've found emply and clean methods in documentation https://github.com/optimalbits/bull/blob/master/reference.md queueempty . however, it is not clear for me how do they work with redis. should they clear redis database after execution? i've tried emply / clean methods and they don't clean my redis db. so i have duplicates: 127.0.0.1:6379 1 > keys 1 bull:vip:repeat 2 bull:notify:repeat:vk-scheduler:notify-scheduler:1506930900000 3 bull:notify:repeat:vk-scheduler:notify-scheduler:1506930600000 4 bull:vip:repeat:scheduler:vip-scheduler:1506942000000 5 bull:vip:repeat:scheduler:vip-scheduler:1506930828000 6 bull:vip:id 7 bull:notify:id 8 bull:notify:repeat 9 bull:notify:repeat:cleaner:notify-cleaner:1506996000000 10 bull:notify:repeat:vk-scheduler:notify-scheduler:1506930300000 11 bull:vip:repeat:scheduler:vip-scheduler:1506930880000 in this case vip-scheduler should run two times per day 0 0 2,12 , but there are duplicates in redis. so i'm not sure how many times it will be executed. does it matter what stores in redis databes? thanks
