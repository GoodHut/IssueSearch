 URL : "https://github.com/publiclab/plotsbot/issues/80" TITLE : config file path broken BODY : ever after 78, i started getting the error: error: enoent: no such file or directory, open '../config.json' however, @codywill mentioned that the particular patch was required for the project to work in windows, however, it seems that for the bot to work in nix systems, the original version worked fine it was deployed on tycho already and worked fine on all our machines . to fix this, we have three options: current path - ../config.json 1. go back to use the original config.json and temporarily break functionality on windows systems. 2. use the slightly more appropriate sounding \ ${__dirname}/../config.json\ 3. use a more cross-platform solution using the path module. cc/ @jywarren
