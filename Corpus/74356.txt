 URL : "https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-form-bridge/issues/31" TITLE : error after some updates BODY : i performed some updates to my code, and all works perfectly fine in my development environment, but when i pushed it out onto my production environment, i'm seeing the below error: unable to load the symfony\component\form\formrenderer runtime in bootstrap_3_layout.html.twig . view: /path/to/view.blade.php view: /path/to/view.blade.php any ideas why this might be? php versions between live and dev are the same, all be it dev is run on centos, where live is on gentoo. looks like it's being thrown in vendor/twig/twig/lib/twig/environment.php:663.
