 URL : "https://github.com/openml/OpenML/issues/480" TITLE : document available filters BODY : i just learned by chance that data sets can be filtered with the following filters: tag,status,limit,offset,data_name,number_instances,number_features,number_classes,number_missing_values. so the list provided in the api docs https://test.openml.org/api_docs/ !/data/get_data_list_filters is incomplete, in particular filtering by data_name is missing.
