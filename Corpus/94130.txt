 URL : "https://github.com/pouladpld/Telegram.Bot.Framework/issues/13" TITLE : botmanager in webhook mode BODY : there is a problem with ibotmanager<tbot> instances lifetime in webhook mode. each middleware in asp.net core is instantiated once and is kept in memory as a part of middleware pipeline. so it is essentially a singleton. but ibotmanager<tbot> has scoped lifetime. ibotmanager<tbot> should be injected as a parameter of invoke method here https://github.com/pouladpld/telegram.bot.framework/blob/master/src/telegram.bot.framework/middlewares/telegrambotmiddleware.cs l44 .
