 URL : "https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/json-feed-viewer/issues/3" TITLE : mixed content warnings BODY : the front page is showing the icons from the example feeds, however some of them are http and therefore make the browser not like your site. i don't think this is a major, however i just thought i'd point it out in case you want to try something different. perhaps a https proxy somewhere much like github do with using camo but perhaps that's too much for what you want to do. https://github.com/atmos/camo or perhaps add a /image proxy passing the url of the feed's icon and then you can serve that from https://json-feed-viewer.herokuapp.com/ too - but perhaps that's a bad idea without proper consideration being taken for content type and content itself, which camo above already does i think. i haven't dug into that project enough apart from know it's there.
