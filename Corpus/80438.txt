 URL : "https://github.com/znc/znc/issues/1407" TITLE : travis: use build stages BODY : i just saw https://blog.travis-ci.com/2017-05-11-introducing-build-stages if i understand the .travis.yml correctly and i do not misremember my observations, znc could use this in its travis build. right now it uses some magic to have one build wait until all other builds are done. sometimes this magic causes the leader build to take so long and so it runs into the timeout imposed by travis. with the new build stages, it should be possible to have a special build that only starts when all other builds are done and were successful.
