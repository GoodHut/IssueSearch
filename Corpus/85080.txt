 URL : "https://github.com/sdcote/batch/issues/11" TITLE : enh: nugget contributions BODY : it would be nice if components could contain http nuggets which act as a ui to that component. when the component initializes, it could register its management nuggets in a central location. then the ui or other component could scan that location, examine the registration and determine how it wanted present that nugget. this way, a new tool could be dropped into the deployment and the operator could then start interacting with it. of course, all nuggets would have to use the security manager, and the manager would have to guard against rogue nuggets allowing unfettered access to the service.
