 URL : "https://github.com/rachelproject/rachelpiOS/issues/34" TITLE : ip table persistence BODY : from @promiseowolabi of the rachel-chip project https://github.com/promiseowolabi/rachel-chip > i also noticed that the iptables are not persistent after rebooting. made some changes to the /etc/rc.local command. sudo sh -c 'echo ifconfig wlan1 10.10.10.10 >> /etc/rc.local; echo service udhcpd restart >> /etc/rc.local; echo iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.ipv4.nat >> /etc/rc.local' or die unable to setup udhcpd reset at boot. look into this whether this is a rpi issue as well
