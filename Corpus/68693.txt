 URL : "https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/56440" TITLE : service backup selector BODY : /kind feature what happened : i would like to be able to have two sets of deployments behind a service. the primary normally would be scaled out and receive all the traffic. if no primaries are available, kube-proxy would use the backup selector to select available pods to enter service. if any primaries come back on, the backups would be removed from service. this would allow for important services to be loaded on kube controllers or other important reserved hardware that normally would be busy doing other things, but could be used still automatically during disasters to try and continue to keep the system running.
