 URL : "https://github.com/audit4j/audit4j-spring/issues/7" TITLE : file audit handler BODY : the spring4jauditconfig class which gets loaded on server startup does not configure the file audit handler properly, as it spring4jauditconfig does not have a map member variable properties which could store the value for log.file.location property. the file audit handler needs the above property value, while it is creating the auditfilewriter instance, during its init method see line 75 of fileaudithandler.java writer = new zerocopyfilewriter getproperty log.file.location ; to fix this issue, we need to set the properties needed by the fileaudithandler, before its init method is called line 358 of context.java . for this purpose, the configcontext static instance of concurrentconfigurationcontext should be set with the properties map value, before the inithandlers is called line 146-155 of context.java . this would need spring4jauditconfig to have a map member variable properties , which reads the value from the spring config and sets it appropriately, further passing this value to configcontext static instance of concurrentconfigurationcontext - which is used during the initialization of fileaudithandler. i will be raising a mr for this shortly. note: the console audit handler and the db audit handler work just fine. it is to be noted the databaseaudithandler.java employs a different strategy to set the db specific properties. instead of setting the properties map variable defined in the parent handler class, it defined individual properties in the child class databaseaudithandler.java and sets these properties via the spring config.
