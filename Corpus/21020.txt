 URL : "https://github.com/xogroup/helm-chart-s3-publisher/issues/8" TITLE : docker hub tagging BODY : you should start tagging your docker hub images. ideally, the tag name would include helm version info. why? imagine i am building my chart using helm in jenkins as the client and it talks to the kubernetes server helm producing my package. now to upload my package to the s3 bucket and refresh the index i call your node.js api. however, if your helm version and the on that produced the package are not the same a problem could occur.
