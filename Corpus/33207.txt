 URL : "https://github.com/barrel-db/barrel-platform/issues/57" TITLE : add bulk docs upload BODY : right now we can only send one doc per request.we should also be able to push multiple docs at once over http. api proposal: a post request is done on /dbs/<dbname>/docs with a json containing a list of documents passed with their revision optionnaly to the docs property : post /dbs/<dbname>/docs http 1/1 x-barrel-isbulk: true content-type: application/json { docs : { doc : { id : doc1 , ... }, rev : rev } ... } the response return the list of document updated with their revisions: post /dbs/<dbname>/docs http 1/1 x-barrel-isbulk: true content-type: application/json { docs : { status : ok , id : doc1 , rev : } ... } if a conffict happened it is returned associated to the document id: { id : doc , status : conflict , conflict : typeofconflict } optionally the header x-barrel-replicated: true will be given to tell we are sending new revisions. thoughts?
