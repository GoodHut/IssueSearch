 URL : "https://github.com/noahpresler/semesterly/issues/1060" TITLE : quit sign-up flow BODY : for features that required a user to be signed in, we need to be more careful to maintain the state of the site if they leave that flow. for example: 1 go to semesterly as a logged-out user 2 try to add a reaction to a course 3 escape the signup flow by clicking escape ==> the course modal disappears 3 click out of the sign-up dialog ==> the sign-up dialog will pop back up
