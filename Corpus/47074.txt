 URL : "https://github.com/ablator/ablator/issues/106" TITLE : nodejs client library BODY : i have a nodejs project and i was thinking about using ablator for feature toggling. i know i can just call the api directly, but having a client library is very helpful. i can work on a client for nodejs, i just need some directions. is a new client library wanted? should i create it as my own repo or would you like to have it in this organization? and what should be it's name? thanks for your good work on this project.
