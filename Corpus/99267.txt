 URL : "https://github.com/keithwhor/UnitGraph/issues/7" TITLE : merge request for open prs BODY : hi @keithwhor - hope you're still around - thanks for this nice graph software. i've made a couple of compatible additions which i use - would be convenient to work out of your official repo instead of my fork. https://github.com/keithwhor/unitgraph/pull/4 https://github.com/keithwhor/unitgraph/pull/5 also would like to avoid conflicts for any other contributors coming along with prs. let me know if you have any issues merging this prs. thanks, -lance.
