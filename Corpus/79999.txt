 URL : "https://github.com/athos-ribeiro/noturno/issues/12" TITLE : support one click toggle BODY : according to one of our reviews on our mozilla addon page 1 , users would like to toggle proxy configurations with a single click. this was the default noturno < 1.0.0 behaviour. the problem here is that implementing this would require substantial changes in noturno again , since we cannot go back to using the browser's proxy settings due to the new webextensions proxy api 2 . what we could easily implement without changing the default behaviour is a advanced options button in our current browseraction, which would take the user to the addon options page 3 . in this options page the user would be able to set addon configurations, such as proxy configurations set the hotkey to be used by noturno enable one click toggle , which would disable the browseraction popup and make the button just toggle the proxy configurations using whatever proxy configurations the user had set there. to disable the one click toggle feature, the user would have to go a long way through the about:addon page to access noturno's options and disable it. in this case, some help text and maybe a confirmation button would be nice to have as well. i would like to hear some users on this feature before going ahead and implementing this feature, so i will leave a question label on the issue and hopefully we will get some feedback before moving on i also replied the user review with a link to this issue . 1 https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/noturno/reviews/926333/ 2 https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/add-ons/webextensions/api/proxy 3 https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/add-ons/webextensions/user_interface/options_pages
