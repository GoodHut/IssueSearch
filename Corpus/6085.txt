 URL : "https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/issues/429" TITLE : version opcode BODY : this opcode would specify for which version of liblouis the table was written. i'm not saying liblouis should actually compile a table differently depending on the version it could though . this is mostly for documentation purpose, to make things more explicit, to make the intentions clear. we can mention in the documentation when a certain opcode was added or removed. liblouis can also more gracefully handle backward incompatibility issues. for example when as of a certain version the behavior of an opcode changed, liblouis can refuse to compile a table that was written for an older version. the version rule should be the very first rule of a table. i'm not sure how to handle include s. we could say that version rules in included tables are always ignored. or we could say that the version of an included table should match the version declared in the including table. or, we could just treat include as a plain and simple text substitution like currently happens in the table compiler not the metadata parser! , and apply the general requirement that version should be the very first rule. possibly the version could be used for discovery too. however i can't really think of a use case at the moment. also until now all discovery metadata + syntax has been about the braille code, not about any table specifics. i think that's a nice rule of thumb to stick with.
