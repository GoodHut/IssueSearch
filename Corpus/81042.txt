BODY : i'm having some issues with vscode-standard tagging my global variables as undefined. i've just switched from atom to vscode and the js standard plugin works like a charm in atom. i add my global variables to the standard property in my package.json as described here. https://standardjs.com/ i-use-a-library-that-pollutes-the-global-namespace-how-do-i-prevent-variable-is-not-defined-errors but vscode-standard does not recognize them.
