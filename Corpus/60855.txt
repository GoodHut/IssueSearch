 URL : "https://github.com/TotomInc/icecreamstand/issues/35" TITLE : add more fallback fonts BODY : expected behavior on some os's there should be a fallback font that quickly appear instead of waiting for itim font to load. current behavior on a slow connection, loading the itim font which is used pretty much everywhere can take some time. while this font is loaded, no text is displayed. possible solution add more fallback fonts to view the text without having to wait for itim font to load. steps to reproduce throttle localhost:8080 network with chrome devtools slow 3g .
