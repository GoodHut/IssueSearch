 URL : "https://github.com/google/aiyprojects-raspbian/issues/1" TITLE : is rpi-upsate required? BODY : in the file https://github.com/google/aiyprojects-raspbian/blob/master/hacking.md, you use the sudo rpi-update line. it's current raspberry pi practice not to use this unless you really need it as it can bring in a non-working kernel i.e. the latest bleeding edge version, which is not guaranteed to work . my thoughts are that it is not actually required once you have done the apt-get update/upgrade cycle. james raspberry pi foundation trading
