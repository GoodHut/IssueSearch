 URL : "https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/issues/782" TITLE : significant startup time BODY : linux, x11. starting up alacritty takes a significant amount of time. simply doing time alacritty -e false reports about 390ms. other terminal emulators, such as urxvt or termite start much faster, at about 160ms for both. it's also not just a matter of this simple benchmark, in normal usage it also feels slower to start.
