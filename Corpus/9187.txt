 URL : "https://github.com/machinamentum/CTR64/issues/7" TITLE : trying to help. BODY : i don't know if you've seen me on reddit/3dshacks, but i've been working on picking this up and working on adding the missing rsp core, and optimizing the program for it to work better. however, i want permission from you, machinamentum, so that i can distribute it of course, you'll be credited as the creator still, since you made all of the code to begin with. i don't know how to pm on here i'm new to github so i'm putting it here. i hope that i can help, and make this emulator a reality, whether it's slow and buggy, or perfect 60fps doubt it . so far, i've just looked through the code for any issues, haven't found too many, since it's so bare bones. adding the rsp core is going to be a chore though.
