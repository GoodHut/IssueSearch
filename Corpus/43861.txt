 URL : "https://github.com/sabnzbd/sabnzbd/issues/1003" TITLE : disable direct unpack BODY : hello, i welcome the new feature to direct unpack, but i have the following situation maybe common to other users , so i'd like to share with you my issue: i have a large raid disk array, which i try to keep off almost all the time i don't use it. this contains the extracted files. i have an additional disk, which i use as temporary folder. i wish that the extraction process runs only a few times a day, so that the energy consumption of the large raid array is kept to minimum. thank you in advance for feedback best regards ls
