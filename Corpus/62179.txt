 URL : "https://github.com/onemedical/datadog-agent-boshrelease/issues/18" TITLE : centos stemcell support BODY : i've discovered today that this release does not support centos. specifically, python-dev/packaging https://github.com/onemedical/datadog-agent-boshrelease/blob/master/packages/python-dev/packaging l9-l12 makes debian assumptions. it's not biggie if i'm the only one having this problem, but i was wondering if there is wider interest in making this release centos compatible.
