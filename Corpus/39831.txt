 URL : "https://github.com/benjjneb/dada2/issues/383" TITLE : subsetting asv table BODY : hi, i want to know if there is a way to subset my asv table into two groups. i have 10 samples, and i want to find all sequences present at least twice in 5 of my samples group x in mapping file , and not found in any of the other 5 samples group y in mapping file . there may also be a way to do this in phyloseq by subsetting the phyloseq object by the two conditions i am investigating, but i have not figured out how to do this. i am interested in finding unique taxa shared across specific groups in my mapping file. thank you for the help!
