 URL : "https://github.com/gofynd/ansible-metricbeat/issues/3" TITLE : some installation issues BODY : installation for redhat doesn't happen automatically. i added this as a workaround: - name: install metricbeat on redhat become: yes include_role: name: gofynd.metricbeat tasks_from: redhat when: ansible_os_family == 'redhat' but a similar line to the one for debian https://github.com/gofynd/ansible-metricbeat/blob/master/tasks/main.yml l2 would be better. and for debian based systems, the package install doesn't obey metricbeat_version . apt https://github.com/gofynd/ansible-metricbeat/blob/master/tasks/debian.yml l14 vs. yum https://github.com/gofynd/ansible-metricbeat/blob/master/tasks/redhat.yml l16 .
