 URL : "https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/issues/3260" TITLE : nginx proxy redirect BODY : is it possible run wallabag via nginx proxy redirection? i hope i'm using the correct terminology. i want to run wallabag on server1, but access it from server2. i have two web apps that insist on running from /, one of which is wallabag. so, i can't run both at once. i thought a solution would be to run wallabag on server1 running nginx , but access it from https://server2/wallabag also nginx . i can get it to load, but the formatting on the login page is wrong. if i access wallabag directly on localhost server1 it looks fine, so the issue must be with the nginx config on server2. perhaps this is not possible with wallabag? i'm still an nginx novice, so i'm probably overlooking something. i mainly want to make sure this is indeed an nginx configuration issue and not some limitation in wallabag. i'd like to confirm this will work before i invest more time is finding a solution. here is the current config: location /wallabag { proxy_set_header x-real-ip $remote_addr; proxy_set_header x-forwarded-for $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; proxy_set_header host $host; proxy_set_header x-nginx-proxy true; proxy_pass http://192.168.1.2/; proxy_redirect http://192.168.1.2/ https://mydomain.com/wallabag/; }
