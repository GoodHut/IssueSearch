 URL : "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/6674" TITLE : generic swig rules BODY : looking into integrating swig into our bazel build all i could find was tensorflows usage. is there any reason parts like _py_wrap_cc have not been extracted to a more general script? would tensorflow be willing to use such a thirdparty script should it get extracted/provided into another github project perhaps ?
