 URL : "https://github.com/evermeer/EVReflection/issues/250" TITLE : help with mapping xml BODY : i have an xml object where some keys can have 1 or more children. this is mapped to an array in swift. when the key has more than 1 child, everything works fine but when it only has 1 it doesn't work. the setvalue:forundefinedkey: method gets called instead. is there an easy way to handle this? i've started creating custom property converters where i have to check if the decodeconverter value contains a dictionary or an array of dictionaries but i'm hoping there's an easier way.
