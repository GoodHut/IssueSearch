 URL : "https://github.com/sddm/sddm/issues/920" TITLE : verbose splash screen BODY : i'm trying to customize sddm to be more verbose so what the system is doing. i hope you can shred some light. the moving icon when loading desktop doesn't seems to be enough for my client, and with mate, we developed a zenity script which showed what the system was doing while it was loading the desktop. chakra theme heritage shows a loading screen which inspired me to do something in there. it shows the full date by default, which i changed by a loading desktop, please wait... which seems ok by the moment, but the final client wants to show more information, like mounting filesystem x | installing software y | mapping printer z using the same logic we did on the zenity script. on the old environment, with lightdm and mate: when a users logged in, pam.d-common-session launched a bash script calling a python script which mounts shares, installing apps, mapping printers, etc and that python writed all the output to a /tmp/output file. then, a bash script is launched tailing that /tmp/output and showing it via zenity until the desktop was shown using wmctrl . that gave the user all the information the system was doing, besides a progress bar. on the new environment with sddm and plasma. basically what i need is to know how can i tail that /tmp/ouput file and show it via sddm through /usr/share/plasma/look-and-feel/org.kde.heritage.desktop/contents/splash/splash.qml i'm horribly new to qt quick just installing right now qt creator for the first time and i just like to know if that what i want is even possible and if so, if there are some example how can i read text from a file. thank you
