 URL : "https://github.com/codecov/support/issues/434" TITLE : simple text ui BODY : i've used code coverage tools for years. codecov nicely integrates with github, which is a huge plus. however the ui appears to me to be distinctly less useful than older tools such as fisheye and cobertura. in particular. it is difficult to impossible to drill down into the code and see what is covered and what is not. the graphical maps look impressive, but are not as usable as plain html tables. all we need is a straightforward html tables that let us drill down into our code and show coverage metrics for each directory, class, line etc. no heat maps. no code folding. these ui widgets make the relevant numbers harder to find and understand.
