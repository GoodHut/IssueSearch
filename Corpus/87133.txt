 URL : "https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-xamarin-native-v2/issues/9" TITLE : is this actually working? BODY : registered the proper clientid and replaced every occurence thereof with the proper id. uwp opened a webview which let me enter my email address. this then is usually redirected to a page where i have to enter the password. instead, here it simply closes the view, no errors given, nothing. on android the whole app simply halts and vs debugger tells me that the app was suspended. nothing else happens. ios was not testable.
