 URL : "https://github.com/Data2Dynamics/d2d/issues/90" TITLE : an explicit tutorial BODY : sorry for somewhat repetitive question. i am new to the d2d software and i am completely lost. my model is very similar to raia_cancerresearch2011 and initially i was very optimistic to start learning powerful d2d functionalities by example and now i see that this showcase and other showcases to do not teach useful techniques how to run an optimization task. the showcases just load already optimized models and plot them. for example, it is not obvious how to set up the parameter bounds, min and max values, it is not obvious how to select an optimizer, it is not obvious how to set parameters for likelihood profile routine etc. i would be very grateful to you if you please help me with these elementary steps.
