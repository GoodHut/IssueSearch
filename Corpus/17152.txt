 URL : "https://github.com/archsaber/angular-flatpickr/issues/18" TITLE : no 2 way binding? BODY : whenever i change the scope variable in my code, which is bound to the flatpickr control the flatpickr value does not change. in other words 2 way binding doesnt seem to work on this. that's the only reason anyone would use this angular version instead of the vanilla version, so let me know if i am doing something wrong. <input ng-flatpickr fp-opts= dateopts ng-model= currentdata.callbackdatetime data-enabletime= true > in my controller: i tried both: $scope.currentdata.callbackdatetime = '2017-09-08 10:30'; and $scope.currentdata.callbackdatetime = new date '2017-09-08 10:30' ; this does not update the flatpickr.
