 URL : "https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/NewHorizons/issues/1121" TITLE : recent server issues BODY : i'm not sure if you are aware of this yet but the past few reboots of the eu server have resulted in everyone timing out for several hours after reboot. tps freezes causing people to get kicked or something. this might be something to look into when you get some time as its happened at least 3-4 server reboots in a row now. thanks!
