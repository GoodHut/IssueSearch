 URL : "https://github.com/CometVisu/CometVisu/issues/605" TITLE : editor broken in chrome BODY : currently no config file can be edited using the build-in editor. the editor stops before loading the the error message: the configuration appears to be not valid. please check with 'check_config.php' for details. error: 'schema is not valid for this configuration, can not find root-level element pages' the cause can be found in the workaround for webkit-based browsers in editor/lib/schema.js in the fixnamespace method. deleting this workaround fixes the problem in chrome v.60 . @netzkind can you check if this workaround is still needed or can we just delete it?
