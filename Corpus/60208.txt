 URL : "https://github.com/foundeo/toscript/issues/31" TITLE : write exception report BODY : would be a nice feature of the cli to write out a report file with all the errors encountered. they're in the output right now, but since there's so much other yellow text they can get lost, especially once the console is closed. an exception report would let the user know what files to go back and finalize.
