 URL : "https://github.com/appbaseio/dejavu/issues/86" TITLE : working with docker BODY : when using the docker image the client will fail while setting up the interface. the client is successfully retrieving data from the index i filled out, cors is working as far as i can tell. what goes wrong is a call made to https://accapi.appbase.io/user . in my logs i can see xmlhttprequest cannot load https://accapi.appbase.io/user. no 'access-control-allow-origin' header is present on the requested resource. origin '<my-dev-domain>' is therefore not allowed access. the response had http status code 401. the content of the response is { message : not logged in, no token } would be awesome if anyone could give an answer to why this call is made and either how to disable it from doing so or how i can make it work. at first i thought this client was to be used separately from appbase, is that not the case? thanks!
