 URL : "https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/7161" TITLE : amp html design flaw BODY : hi everyone, i have a real issue with amp html and want some advice. i have a pwa website for my desktop and tablets users and i am halfway through building a custom amp website for my mobile users. call me old fashioned if you like. but i value user experience a lot! i really don't think it's a good idea to have a user on a mobile device load your amp website and then click a link which moves on to your main website. the reason i think it's a bad idea is that that whole template is different. i want my mobile users to stay on the amp website and not move across to the pwa website at all. i have full trust in pwa and both amp-html projects. the trouble is i can not do this because of some rules google has made?! below is a screenshot of google rules: ! amp-schema https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17784082/22220607/39d959fe-e1a7-11e6-9eea-f95e853dd569.png please see rule 4. i am using schema.org to mark up both pwa and amp-html and my issue is using json-ld breadcrumblist to mark-up my navigation links. if i follow this crazy rule i have to make all my links on my amp-html point to my pwa. basically i will have this setup for all my links: amp page > pwa > 303 redirect to new amp page the problem is for every new webpage the user selects they are going to have 2 hops instead of one . to me this is a design flaw, because i just want this setup: amp page> new amp page with all these extra hops the loading of the new amp page will be slowed down and put extra pressure on my server to process all these extra hops. if anyone from google is listening can't you change rule 4 to be rich cards only and not all schema markup. anyway, i would love to hear what the experts here have to say about adding links to an amp page. should we link them to main website in my case pwa or can i just link amp to amp? thanks in advance.
