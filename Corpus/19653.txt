 URL : "https://github.com/luckyframework/lucky_record/issues/153" TITLE : add queryable last BODY : the intended behavior is that the query would only return the last row. the way i would do this is by flipping the order and limiting to 1. crystal class luckyrecord::querybuilder ... @orders = { asc: of symbol | string, desc: of symbol | string, } def reverse_order if @orders.asc.empty? && @orders.desc.empty? @orders.desc << id else @orders.asc, @orders.desc = @orders.desc, @orders.asc end end ... end then last would be as follows: crystal module luckyrecord::queryable t ... def last query.reverse_order query.first end end any thoughts on this?
