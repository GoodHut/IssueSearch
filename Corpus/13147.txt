 URL : "https://github.com/xybu/onedrived-dev/issues/38" TITLE : sync shared dirs BODY : right now i can't figure out how to get onedrivd to sync shared directories, is it possible? it seems to be possible in other clients as shown here https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/add-and-sync-shared-folders-to-onedrive-8a63cd47-1526-4cd8-bd09-ee3f9bfc1504 so it should be possible with onedrived as well. is it possible currently with onedrived?
