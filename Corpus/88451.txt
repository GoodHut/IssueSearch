 URL : "https://github.com/greatman/craftconomy3/issues/123" TITLE : no logging for /money log BODY : hi, today we migrated our main server geistlande from gringotts to craftconomy. except from issue 120 everything is fine. only logging financial transactions doesn't work. no transactions are shown with /money log or /money log page player and even in the database there are no entries in cc3_log table. is there anything i'm missing, a permission or something? or is this just not functional atm?
