 URL : "https://github.com/firewalld/firewalld/issues/268" TITLE : logging with ulog? BODY : hi all it's good to have logging working, indeed, but i wonder why firewalld doen't support using the ulog target instead of log. this may not be everyone's choice, but for some it can be a good way to get the firewall logs away from potentially more important logs to be practically visible, for instance in the dmesg command. i looked at the code, and couldn't find any traces of ulog, and nothing on google either. so - has this been discussed?
