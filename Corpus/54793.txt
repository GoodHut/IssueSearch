 URL : "https://github.com/kamilmysliwiec/nest/issues/113" TITLE : how do you set up ssl? BODY : is there a way to start the nest application with ssl cert options so i can have a https server? for now i manually call the init function on the nest app and start the https server with express app manually. let options = { key: fs.readfilesync config.ssl_key_path , cert: fs.readfilesync config.ssl_cert_path }; let httpsserver = https.createserver options, expressapp ; const app = nestfactory.create applicationmodule, expressapp ; app.useglobalpipes new validatorpipe ; app.init ; httpsserver.listen httpsport ; i was just wondering if there is any standard way of doing ssl with nest. couldn't find it in the documentation.
