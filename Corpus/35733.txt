 URL : "https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/issues/4390" TITLE : external audio files BODY : is this still a thing? i'm pretty sure this worked up until i updated mpv to the latest version, and now it just doesn't get recognized. it probably works through command line, but i'm talking about a more ux-friendly method - having an audio file and a video file on the same folder, with the same name, and then opening the video and get the external audio to show up when changing tracks. i tried with different video/audio combinations - nothing shows up other than internal audio.
