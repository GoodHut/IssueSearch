 URL : "https://github.com/cfwheels/cfwheels/issues/785" TITLE : fix class naming BODY : all classes should be my-class instead of myclass . note that the lowercasedynamicclassvalues on flashmessages can probably be removed. we might want to also consider the bootstrap style of variable addition. so you have a base class, flash-message and then variants of it are done via an additional class, i.e, flash-message-danger .
