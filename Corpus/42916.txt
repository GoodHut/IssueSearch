 URL : "https://github.com/devxoul/URLNavigator/issues/84" TITLE : carthage cannot build BODY : downloading urlnavigator.framework binary at 2.0.2 skipped installing urlnavigator.framework binary due to the error: incompatible swift version - framework was built with 4.0 swiftlang-900.0.65 clang-900.0.37 and the local version is 4.0.2 swiftlang-900.0.69.2 clang-900.0.38 . checking out urlnavigator at 2.0.2 xcodebuild output can be found in /var/folders/vz/3fwzpk4n73sd5qmp95675c600000gp/t/carthage-xcodebuild.cayb0e.log skipped building urlnavigator due to the error: dependency urlnavigator has no shared framework schemes if you believe this to be an error, please file an issue with the maintainers at https://github.com/devxoul/urlnavigator/issues/new if you provide a shared scheme to build then carthage will build a new binary with our version of swift. this will allow us to get around swift's version issues since it doesn't have a stable abi.
