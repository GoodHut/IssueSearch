 URL : "https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/7710" TITLE : split rancher images? BODY : hey, actually rancher can be installed with docker image. i think would be nice when rancher will split into specific packages like server and ui . server package will be like actual rancher image but without ui. ui can be installed optionally or at local machine. regards, mateusz paluszkiewicz
