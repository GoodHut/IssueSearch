 URL : "https://github.com/funkyg/funkytunes/issues/23" TITLE : ability to send raw search BODY : some albums are not on discogs but are on tpb/st. i thought about adding a menu item below all the search results: search for <raw search query here> not sure how to explain it so here's a pic: http://f.gdr.name/funkyfunky.png pressing the extra list item would just search tpb and st for gang albanii and play the first result. i looked into implementing it but can't wrap my head around the list adapter.
