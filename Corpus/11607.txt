 URL : "https://github.com/AnthonyEbert/queuecomputer/issues/16" TITLE : images in readme BODY : > it was recently pointed out to us that some readme.html files generated > from the corresponding readme.md ones on the cran package web pages are > incomplete, missing 'local' images not available from the web page and > in most cases actually not even shipped with the package. this clearly > should be changed, so we will move to using '--self-contained' for the > pandoc conversion to ensure that the readme.html files are complete . > > of course, this implies that all 'local' images used in readme.md are > needed in the package sources. > > if the images are also used for vignettes or rd files, you can put them > in the 'vignettes' or 'man/figures' directories. otherwise, please put > them in the top-level 'tools' directory, or a subdirectory of it. > > the cran incoming checks in r-devel were changed to perform the pandoc > conversion checks with '--self-contained', and hence will warn about > missing images. > > pls ensure completeness in the next regular update of your package. > > for your information, i attach a list of images used in readme.md but > missing from the package sources.
