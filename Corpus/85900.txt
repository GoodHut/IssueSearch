 URL : "https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak/issues/453" TITLE : fully turn off uac prompt BODY : please provide as much as possible information to reproduce the issue. with the new build there is no longer a way to fully turn off the uac prompt. why is this required? is it for the large pagefiles ? is there an compile option im missing to avoid it asking for admin privs on the first run since id rather avoid giving it any admin privileges. the old option i used to use in the previous build is gone
