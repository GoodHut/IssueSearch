 URL : "https://github.com/dlbeer/mspdebug/issues/34" TITLE : mspdebug on macos BODY : hi, rf2500s are hid usb devices. unfortunately macos does not let libusb to access these devices. a so-called 'codeless' kernel extension would be required. however it should be signed, and apple does not accept kext signing for open source projects it seems it would have to be signed off by the manufacturer/owner, i.e. ti... good luck with that https://github.com/libusb/libusb/wiki/faq does_libusb_support_usb_hid_devices however, there seems to be an alternative: use the hid api to drive the hid device on macos. i guess the best option would be to use the native hid framework to do so. meanwhile, here is a proof of concept that relies on hidapi that it nice enough to provide an api that is very close to libusb: https://github.com/eblot/mspdebug/tree/rf2500_hidapi at least, we can use the excellent mspdebug tool on osx / macos with a launchpad :-
