 URL : "https://github.com/Carreau/open-with-binder-firefox-extension/issues/8" TITLE : identify branch from url BODY : thanks for the super-nice add-on! i noticed that if you call the extension when you're browsing a feature branch, it doesn't detect the tree in the url, and launches binder with master . can this be tweaked so the appropriate branch gets called in binder? thanks, once again!
