 URL : "https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips/issues/920" TITLE : more than one ${visual} BODY : hi. first of all, thank for sharing your plugin with the world. i'm a vim beginner and i feel lucky to have found it soon enough. i'm sticking with it to make some live-coding using tidal cycles really fast. second, sorry for using this space to make a question rather then reporting a bug. i couldn't find a proper communication channel for that. i would like to ask you if there is a way to have more than one piece of text or code in - probably - different buffers and when expanding a snippet using also more than one ${visual}, to have them inserted in the respective places. best regards, gil
