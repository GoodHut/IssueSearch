 URL : "https://github.com/terzakig/gptam/issues/2" TITLE : undistort input image BODY : hi, thanks for the thorough re-comment , which helps a lot in understanding the ptam paper. one question regards to patchfinder.cpp, comments around line 67 shows: // to do this, we have to project the batsignal using the camera object. problem is, the projection model is no longer linear, // due to the presence of the radial distortion compensation term. so what do we do???? of copurse we linearize hey, its // practically a linear relationship for the most part anyway ... if i use an undistort image directly, then the intrinsic matrix alone will be linear, then the a warp matrix will be much easier to get since the t={r, t} is known/estimated in advance. i wonder why the author didn't choose this much easier way?
