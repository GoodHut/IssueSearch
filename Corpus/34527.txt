 URL : "https://github.com/railsbridgesd/railsbridgesd/issues/41" TITLE : clean up stylesheets BODY : i know what you guys are thinking. man, these stylesheets are a disaster! just kidding... but i do want to tidy things up a bit. - rename variables.scss to colors.scss since they are mostly color variables - move type variables into type.scss - add comments to type.scss - keep style declarations in alphabetical order - decrease footer headline text size to 32px since there are no font hints for 35px
