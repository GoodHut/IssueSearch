 URL : "https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/510" TITLE : define name for new notes? BODY : is it possible to define how notes are named? what's i'd really like is to define how the note is named, and when creating a new new, if a note of that name already exists, switch to it. example: i name my notes yyyymmdd, click new note today and it creates a note named 20170203 unless such a note already exists, in which case we switch to that note. useful for journal type notebooks. thanks!
