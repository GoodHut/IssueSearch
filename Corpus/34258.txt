 URL : "https://github.com/stevelacy/gulp-open/issues/28" TITLE : can't find gulp-open BODY : hi all, just a quick question. i installed gulp-open with the following codes on gulpfiles.js: gulp.task 'open', function { var options = { uri: uri, app: 'chrome' || 'google chrome' // may need to sniff for windows/osx to determine chrome string }; gulp.src './build/' .pipe open options ; } ; i also have gulp-connect and gulp-yargs with the following: var src = './build', dist = './build', baseurl = argv.production === undefined ? src : dist, port = argv.production === undefined ? 8000 : 8001, uri = 'http://localhost:' + port; gulp.task 'connect', function { connect.server { root: baseurl, livereload: true, port: port } ; } ; i'm not sure what is happening, on the package.json the dependency is there, but gulp can't find it. any ideas what's happening? thank you in advance. kind regards, fernando fas
