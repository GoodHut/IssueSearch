 URL : "https://github.com/olifolkerd/tabulator/issues/635" TITLE : sorting letters wrongly BODY : in sweden we have 3 extra letters, å, ä, ö, which are placed after z, so x-y-z-å-ä-ö. on my computer where i have a swedish os language, sorting by letters works correctly and places for example älska at the bottom of a list, after z. however when the os is english, it places it after the letter a, so we have a-ä-b-c-d etc. setting locale: 'sv' doesn't change anything.
