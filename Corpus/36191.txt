BODY : hi, it's me again xd.. great work by the way. i have a problem, does tabulator let you get data using an id as filter? something like, varr indexvalue = 1; var data = $ example-table .tabulator getdata , indexvalue ; i can do something like getting all the data and then filtering using jquery, but i'm looking for performance here. thanks in advance
