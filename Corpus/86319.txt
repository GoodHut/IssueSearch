 URL : "https://github.com/stellar/go/issues/204" TITLE : horizon on https problems BODY : trying to get horizon to work with https. tried to follow these instructions, but probably messed something up. https://github.com/stellar/go/blob/master/services/horizon/internal/docs/developing.md -enabling-tls-on-your-local-workstation instructions weren't clear, so i made some guesses. i'm running the stellar docker image on a server, works fine. site has certificate and accessing the website in https works. 1. bashed into the docker container 2. i ran the regen.sh tool and created the certs and they are at /tls 3. modified the horizon.env and added this: export tls_cert= /tls/server.crt export tls_key= /tls/server.key 4. restarted horizon, no errors 5. client app now uses https url to the server for horizon 6. now getting err_insecure_response in client i'm assuming i'm missing a step. do i need to change urls in config files from http to https? thanks
