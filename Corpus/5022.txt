BODY : i think we have all contributed and expressed our ideas fully onto this paper and i totally understand that doing that is a part of the process, but i think now is the time to be a little ruthless in the effort to make it more concise. i pasted it on word and it had 52 pages. it is too important to be this long, we want this to be widely read, to reach all corners of the earth and make waves. for that purpose, i would suggest 25 pages maximum. i am positive that it is possible to be done without leaving any key information out. but it will take both effort and detachment. i urge everyone to look into what they wrote and: a- shorten sentences. it's amazing how much you can achieve just by doing this, and it always sounds so much better afterwards. b - check if one of the ideas wasn't mentioned in another part of the paper there are many times where the importance of decentralization and sovereignty is written about, for example . there's no need to repeat things, it's better to be concise and say everything just once. c- ask themselves if that piece of information in particular is absolutely relevant and the goals of the whitepaper would not be achieved without it. if not, don't discard: save it somewhere for a future medium post ;
