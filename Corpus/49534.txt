 URL : "https://github.com/yebai/Turing.jl/issues/155" TITLE : turing exports plot ? BODY : not critical, but a bit annoying in the long run: it seems that turing exports a plot function that conflicts with other plot packages. in my case... julia using turing using plots gs i get warning: both plots and turing export plot ; uses of it in module main must be qualified and i can plot only using plots.plot
