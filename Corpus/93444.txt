 URL : "https://github.com/dojo/grunt-dojo2-extras/issues/13" TITLE : add task to publish to npm BODY : as an engineer, it would be nice to have a way to instruct travis automatically publish to npm or to publish locally using an automated process. an automated publish could be triggered by committing to master w/ npm-publish in the commit message. the system would then validate the commit, check that version in package.json is valid and not marked w/ -pre , and that the version is not already published to npm. the process would look something like this: prompt for npm credentials if running locally assert no changed files in git check package.json's version no -pre tag version isn't already published on npm new version is the latest version publish to npm a tag is added to git using the released version the version in package.json is incremented and a -pre tag is added the new package.json is committed and pushed w/ the tags optional the commit information from the previous release is displayed for release notes optional the new release is tagged using the github apis and the above commit information is used note: doing a github release requires oauth credentials for github, which would provide access to all repositories, so we may want to consider automating release notes as a separate feature.
