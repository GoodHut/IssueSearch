 URL : "https://github.com/HearthSim/HDT-Voice/issues/4" TITLE : voice recognition errors BODY : so i am encountering the fact that the voice recognition is recognizing the wrong words and failing to use them properly. i might be explaining it wrong... but i know for sure that if i were to say 'play card 3' it instead will 'click card 3.' it's not that it stops doing what it's doing or anything... the recognized words at the bottom left specifically say 'click card 3' when i specifically told it 'play card 3.' i tested this by moving my mouse to the board and just saying 'play.' it 'click'ed instead. then there's also the fact of it not recognizing basic cards. tried to make it use the coin, but it kept failing to do so. no relevant data is being sent to the log, so i have not posted it here. can there be video recorded of this working by anyone else at all? or something confirmed to it not working properly? please and thank you.
