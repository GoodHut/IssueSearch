 URL : "https://github.com/netgroup-polito/frog4-orchestrator/issues/10" TITLE : bug in returned graph id BODY : when the graph is deployed, the returned id is not always correct. if the id starts with '0', the first zero is truncated. for example: the graph id is: 09234, the put of the graph returns 9234. the bug doesn't appear into the get of all graphs, but only in the put of a graph.
