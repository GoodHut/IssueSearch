 URL : "https://github.com/assister-ai/agenda-rest/issues/2" TITLE : define vs jobs BODY : hi! i wanted to ask a question about the implementation just to understand the logic. the api /api/new creates a definition of a job and the callback and then /api/every or /api/schedule creates the jobs. i was wondering what the reason was not to just create the definition at the same time as the job is created? why did you decide to create a table of definitions? thanks! tony
