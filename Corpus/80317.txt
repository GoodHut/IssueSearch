 URL : "https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/179" TITLE : time / date type support BODY : majority of languages kaitai struct supports do have some sort of date / time data type. it would be super useful to have some basic conversion functions that would allow to get stuff like packet timestamps, file / inode times, etc, in language native data type. for python, i would propose standard datetime module https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html , and, in particular, datetime.datetime type https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html datetime-objects .
