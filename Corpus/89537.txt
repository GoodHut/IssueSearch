 URL : "https://github.com/tsdev/spinw/issues/39" TITLE : question: octave support? BODY : hi, i hope this is the appropriate place to ask questions about spinw, please refer me to the appropriate venue if not! has spinw been tested with octave https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/ ? are there any plans for support? asking because we have limited matlab licenses available, and would be nice to be able to run core spinw features even if not, say, symbolic calculations using free software.
