 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29421" TITLE : fontstyle not updating BODY : discovered in 29393 the pull requests makes a change so that settings can specify color and fontstyle overrides for themes. updating colors works just fine, but if i add a setting for modifying the font style of a scope, the font style of those matching tokens won't actually re-render until i type to modify a token and then only that token is updated. see the gif below for an example. note: if i use the theme switcher to change to a new theme that has a font style applied for a scope. ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2957173/27527129-546b01de-5a4a-11e7-9010-fadd636c14fa.png
