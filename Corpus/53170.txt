 URL : "https://github.com/ferram4/Ferram-Aerospace-Research/issues/181" TITLE : dense voxels kills fps BODY : hopefully just a minor annoyance & not the cause of a larger issue but if i have a craft voxelized like this in the editor: ! be65147a-1621-11e7-8287-308bf4bb6fe6 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18425575/24740883/544f2522-1a71-11e7-8f35-0251c668b19b.png then the frame rate tanks enormously. however if i have a larger craft voxelized the fps are fine. i'm wondering if the max amount of voxels are trying to be drawn over such a small volume and that's taxing the game somehow.
