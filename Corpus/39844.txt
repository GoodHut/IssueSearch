 URL : "https://github.com/troyth/node-raspicam/issues/34" TITLE : such a great module! BODY : @troyth i'd love to help with issues/releases on this module if you want additional maintainers? i realize open-source can be really time-consuming. i've been using this for a few of my raspberry pi projects and i love it and would like to see it get even better.
