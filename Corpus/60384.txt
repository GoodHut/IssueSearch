 URL : "https://github.com/liftoff/pyminifier/issues/97" TITLE : --pyz doesn't obfuscate BODY : i have a python program that requires 4 other local .py files. to simplify distribution and to obfuscate the source, i used pyminifier 2.1 and used both the -o and --pyz=outfile.pyz options. i expected that pyminifier would obfuscate all 5 files and package them up into one compact pyz file. i used the command: pyminifier -o --replacement-length=10 --pyz=myprog.pyz myprog.py now, the resulting .pyz file works beautifully. but when i used 7zip to expand the contents, i discovered that none of the 5 files had been obfuscated...! this seems to be a fairly serious bug. or am i doing it wrong ?
