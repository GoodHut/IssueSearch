 URL : "https://github.com/conan-io/conan/issues/1009" TITLE : scopes part 2 BODY : this issue is partly related to 331 say i'm exporting a package recipe. now conan search gives this. - mypackage/0.1.0@user/channel i can install it locally assume i'm building from source through conan using following command. - conan install mypackage/0.1.0@user/channel --build mypackage everything works fine up to this point. but it doesn't work if i try to pass a scope variable for the above install command. no scope variable is set there - conan install mypackage/0.1.0@user/channel --build mypackage --scope key=value i'm stuck here without being able to pass a flag that doesn't affect the package integrity. can you explain this and provide any possible work around if this is the expected behavior.
