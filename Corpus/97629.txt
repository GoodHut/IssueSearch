 URL : "https://github.com/smollweide/node-mock-server/issues/63" TITLE : hook after server startup? BODY : i fork node-mock-server in the rollup plugin. it would be helpful to know when nms has come up, so i can open the application after the server is up. is there such a hook already or would you accept a pr to process.send a message back to the parent process after the server has started?
