 URL : "https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/issues/4268" TITLE : add a global around option BODY : we allow users to pass an around option https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/ cameraoptions to some camera methods. this ticket proposes a around option be added to map as a constructor option, getter, and setter. this option would specify a default value for around on all camera mutations so that - it becomes possible to specify around for implicit camera mutation, such as those triggered by use of the navigationcontrol - it becomes more ergonomic to use the same around value for all camera mutations open questions - does around make sense semantically in this case? many users will be using this feature because they have a translucent element over the map. in that use case, padding is a more intuitive option. - might users be confused about the difference between around and center ? can we find a naming convention that eliminates that confusion? - are there any other parameters that should have global defaults like this?
