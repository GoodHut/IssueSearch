 URL : "https://github.com/datproject/dat-secret-storage/issues/5" TITLE : using os x keychain BODY : it's pretty straightforward to get/put keys in keychain.app https://github.com/git/git/blob/35f6318d44379452d8d33e880d8df0267b4a0cd0/contrib/credential/osxkeychain/git-credential-osxkeychain.c you can also spawn /usr/bin/security but spawning a process on require would be weird. if we wrote a native addon to wrap those syscalls, we could use keychain on mac if the prebuild is available and otherwise still use the current strategy. any downsides to this?
