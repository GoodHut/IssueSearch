 URL : "https://github.com/golang/dep/issues/276" TITLE : finalize manifest and lock BODY : a crucial early goalpost for dep is to have stable, committable manifest and lock files. it's a 1.0 -ish moment: once we have an implementation that we're satisfied with, we will make a backwards-compatibility guarantee that should be good, even if/when dep has made it into the go toolchain. this is the epic/meta-issue for this goal; there's also a milestone https://github.com/golang/dep/milestone/1 . once the backwards-compatibility bc point is reached, we _may_ want to aim for some forwards-compatibility rules - namely, disallowing or warning when unrecognized keys appear in one of the files. cargo does something like this http://doc.crates.io/manifest.html the-metadata-table-optional . there are several high level issues that need to be resolved here related to file naming, format, and location: 168 - naming of files 207 - docs/faq on files 119 - file format there are some issues that affect the semantics of values currently stored within the files: 225 - default to caret behavior these will either need to be fully resolved prior to the bc point, or a plan for accommodating them while maintaining full bc must be presented. there are also issues that may entail adding fields to the manifest and/or lock: 221 - installing local versions of supporting tooling 275 - report solver/analyzer versions 220 this needs its own issue proper - parameterizing by build tags. also, sdboyer/gps 44
