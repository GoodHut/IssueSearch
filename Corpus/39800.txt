 URL : "https://github.com/Widen/tabitha/issues/12" TITLE : streaming xls writer BODY : currently writing xls files uses the workbook api, which keeps the entire file in memory. it would be nice to be able to stream rows to disk as they are written to keep memory low. ideally this would be done with the low-level biff records api, but the format for this is complex and not well documented.
