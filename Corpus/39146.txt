 URL : "https://github.com/rajatthareja/ReportBuilder/issues/37" TITLE : retry failure format BODY : in addition to the json and html formats, is there any chance that a retry format could be added that would generate a single rerun file similar to what the rerun formatter does for cucumber? e.g. features/foo.feature:5 features/bar.feature:7:13 features/nested/thing.feature:13 alternatively, this could be another tab in the html report instead of a separate file but preferably still in list format so that it can be copy/pasted into a file for consumption by cucumber .
