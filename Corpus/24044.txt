 URL : "https://github.com/supercrypta/supercrypta.github.io/issues/3" TITLE : save screen estate BODY : please consider giving up some screen estate and cleaning up the display by making the collapsible controls completely optional. for tracking purposes, i couldn't care less for a calculator. the total hold should appear below the currency entries at the least, or maybe become an optional last entry on the list. ideally, the widget would be just the market/portfolio currency list for me.
