 URL : "https://github.com/HumbleSpark/ellie-issues/issues/11" TITLE : add support for ctrl+s BODY : hi, first of all thanks so much for ellie. i learned about this from the code sandbox repository and it's really nice to experiment with elm. ðŸ˜„ one small usability improvement that i would like to suggest is to to add support for ctrl+s for windows. i haven't tried my mac yet, perhaps cmd+s works there, but if not then the same feature request would apply. currently when using this key combination it prompts me the windows save-as dialog. why i am asking this is because it would speed up the development more. currently, having to move the mouse to the upper left corner to click compile is not really convenient.
