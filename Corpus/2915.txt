 URL : "https://github.com/inexor-game/code/issues/392" TITLE : fix the clock BODY : currently the design of all updates in the engine is as follows: cpp extern int totalmillis; // elapsed wall time since program start in real milliseconds extern int elapsedtime; // elapsed wall time since last updatetime in real milliseconds // note: virtual game milliseconds is scaled with the gamespeed and effected by a paused game. extern int curtime; // elapsed frame time since last updatetime in virtual game milliseconds extern int lastmillis; // elapsed frame time since program start in virtual game milliseconds and curtime basically controls most game stuff, totalmillis controls anything which needs to function independently of the current match. there are highly probably serious issues with that: http://www.koonsolo.com/news/dewitters-gameloop/ http://gafferongames.com/game-physics/fix-your-timestep/ tl;dr: bc of rounding errors based on the relative updated time you can shoot/get shot through walls on fast computers and more . _~~furthermore maxfps is heavily broken, too.~~ fixed in branch remove_standalone2_
