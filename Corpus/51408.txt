 URL : "https://github.com/nlf/blankie/issues/19" TITLE : allow setting base-uri BODY : hey there, i think it would be helpful to be able to set the base-uri . currently i haven't found a way to do that with blankie. am i missing something? as per google's csp evaluator: > missing base-uri allows the injection of base tags. they can be used to set the base url for all relative script urls to an attacker controlled domain. thank you for this plugin!
