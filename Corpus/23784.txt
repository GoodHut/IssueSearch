 URL : "https://github.com/leonaard/icalendar2fullcalendar/issues/13" TITLE : reload ics sources BODY : first of all, superb bridge for the fullcalendar.io software! i’ve been searching fullcalendar for a way to reload the ics_sources on to the calendar. for example, if i edit an event on my iphone or whatever i’d like it to be reflected on the calendar without a full page reload. is there a way to either periodically timed parameter , or manually button event , refresh the ics sources and render them to the calendar without refreshing the whole page? thanks
