 URL : "https://github.com/Construktion/Construktion/issues/20" TITLE : conditional value support BODY : it might be useful to allow properties to be set based on a condition of another property. for instance, if x property is set to a , y property must be b . at first thought this could be handled by making the object under construction a property of the construktioncontext. passing these between recursive blueprints might be a problem because currently you are always newing up a new construktioncontext for each call into the pipeline.
