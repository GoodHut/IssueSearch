 URL : "https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/1472" TITLE : contact point for datasets BODY : i'm looking at how to describe some ons datasets using the new dataset term. here's an example https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/datasets/consumerpriceindices . every dataset has a public contact point, which is a member of staff who can help with questions relating to the dataset. none of the existing properties seem to cover this. the person isn't necessarily the author, creator, editor, etc of the dataset. while they could arguably a described as a contactpoint for the organisation publishing the dataset, in this case the named person isn't a general point of contact for the whole ons, just for 1 or more datasets. perhaps datasets should have a contactpoint ? or is there a general property that could be used which i'm missing?
