 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/16832" TITLE : roslyn in typescript ? BODY : one of the brightest features in the kotlin language https://kotlinlang.org is its ability to translate into javascript. but for c language we did not have like that. of course some libraries exist but not good so i think if typescript support roslyn itself, we can use 1. for refactoring,analyzing , ... like c 2. mapping c => typescript => javascript in the best way as possible that would be very useful in some projects and scenarios especially in generators so do typescript team have plan for roslyn in typescript ? especially with great @ahejlsberg
