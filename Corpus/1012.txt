 URL : "https://github.com/randdusing/cordova-plugin-bluetoothle/issues/395" TITLE : detect busy BODY : if i have multiple read/writes to do, i use my own queuing system to handle this. however, with the async nature of things - this isn't always possible. if i try and read/write when another operation is happening it will error out. is there a way of checking if the device is free/busy before i make any calls?
