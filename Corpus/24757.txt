 URL : "https://github.com/SmileyChris/easy-thumbnails/issues/474" TITLE : thumbnails and seo BODY : the problem: you have a site. you create thumbnails, let's say for a gallery. thumbs and big versions, let's say 200x200, and 2000x2000. google indexes these images. after some time, you decide to change the thumbnail options for thumb and big versions. all indexed images become invalid or worse, are still there/accessible, but are no more used/referenced in the sites html code . seo wise, this is a mess. what i wonder: is there a already existing solution for this problem? i'm just getting used to thumbnail_name and other settings, so one solution i can think, is always using aliases, and then just use a namer that does something like original_name-alias.extension . so the options ie size/quality/whatever of the alias could change, but not the filename. in my example this would be animage-big.jpg and animage-thumb.jpg ... other ideas are using http headers for canonical images ie point to the original image... , but this would be another effort, and would probably go too far for easy-thumbnails...
