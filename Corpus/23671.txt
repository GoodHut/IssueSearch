 URL : "https://github.com/ReSpeak/TS3Hook/issues/13" TITLE : r10 instead of eax BODY : this isn't really an issue but more of an inquiry on how the patch works, i saw how it works mostly in ida but when i go to breakpoint the packet out address i find the plaintext command in r10 instead of eax, why is this? do you have any symbols for the teamspeak client? if so do you mind sharing?
