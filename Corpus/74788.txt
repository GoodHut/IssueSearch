 URL : "https://github.com/ak121/orie4741/issues/11" TITLE : final report peer review BODY : the goal of the project is to building a model which can predict accepting or rejecting loan. it's a very useful model for many applications. one of the good things i can see from the report is that the prediction set is divided into not just fully paid and not paid, but to 7 categories and specifying how late the borrower will pay. back to the report itself, reading the report is very tedious. there is barely any visualization to show the data or show the result. almost everything is described by very long and redundant paragraphs. besides, the whole report is like telling story instead of a professional report that it's supposed to be. a lot of grammatical, spelling and formatting issues are also in the report. one of the most obvious issues is that i don't remember the team members using how many i in the report. it shouldn't appear on a professional report like this. i suggest the team members can read the report for many times and realize such an issue. for the model and result section, i am confused of why the team members use two training sets, with 2 different number of data. the table shows us the comparison of different models but one huge problem i can see is that the model's overall prediction accuracy is high, but the accuracy of predicting late payment is very low. it doesn't seem like that they are reliable models. after the table, it is very long and tedious paragraphs again. i couldn't even find a conclusion of the work the team members have done in this project. overall, it seems that the logic of the whole report is confusing. the team members might do some solid work in the project, but they didn't use an effective way to show it on the report. i suggested the team can read some of the good examples and restructure their report.
