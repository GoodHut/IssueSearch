 URL : "https://github.com/javaee/servlet-spec/issues/175" TITLE : samesite cookie support BODY : good morning, i'm not sure if this is the best avenue to communicate this feedback, but while working on lift/framework 1828 we discovered that the current version of the servlet api doesn't support the same-site cookie attribute https://www.owasp.org/index.php/samesite . i would like to propose an addition to javax.servlet.http.cookie to add support for this attribute in servlet api 4.0, which would give us a path forward in the lift framework for supporting it.
