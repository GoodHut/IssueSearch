 URL : "https://github.com/ellisp/ellisp.github.io/issues/42" TITLE : hi and thanks BODY : hi peter, i'm not sure if this is the best place to do this, but i just wanted to touch base and say hi. i'm a reporter with fairfax and i'm going to be doing a lot of reporting on polls, voting demographics, geography etc in the coming weeks and have found your blog to be a brilliant resource. i'm currently delving into the nzes and am hoping to do some reporting on that leading up to the election. i code in python mostly, so sadly i may not be able to make best use of you relect package - perhaps i will have to upskill and learn some more r in time for 2017. anyway i just wanted to get in touch given we seem to be interested in similar datasets and to say thanks for the excellent work. cheers, andy fyers
