 URL : "https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/issues/5270" TITLE : upgrade gmp versions BODY : we're currently a couple of releases behind. the latest version is 6.1.2 and we're on 6.0.0 we should upgrade and switch to the new third-party directory structure like we've done for qthreads 4498 , hwloc 3453 , jemalloc 3424 , and gasnet 3914 . we should also track when new gmp releases come out and upgrade as appropriate. gmp isn't released nearly as often as hwloc/jemalloc/gasnet, so it shouldn't be too much work.
