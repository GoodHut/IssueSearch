 URL : "https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server/issues/3326" TITLE : acl stops working randomly BODY : issue description acl stops working at random intervals. i have a few roles that containing specific users. these roles are then applied to some entries in a table. the acl is ignored. it will start working if i restart the parse server. it stops working after a few hours or even a few minutes. there are no jobs touching the acl for these rows or table. this affects all users. i'm sorry if i cannot provide a reproducible scenario. the issue is quite critical for my application and makes no sense that a restart fixes the issue for a while and then breaks again. i don't see anything in the parse server logs that suggests an error of this nature. steps to reproduce 1. create a role and add a user to it 2. set the acl of one entry of a table with this role 3. restart parse server 4. find all entries on the table expected results - all entries will be retrieved for the users with the role - only entries with public acl will be returned for users without the role actual outcome - all entries are retrieved regardless of the role of the user. - if the node hosting the parse-server is restarted, the acl works fine. - acl stops working after a while it could be a few minutes or a few hours . environment setup - server - parse-server version: 2.2.25 - operating system: 64bit amazon linux 2016.09 - node.js version: 6.9.1 - hardware: c4.large - localhost or remote server?: aws - database - mongodb version: 3.2.11 - storage engine: mmapv1 - hardware: m1 - localhost or remote server?: mlab
