 URL : "https://github.com/attic-labs/noms/issues/3177" TITLE : make sync great again BODY : noms sync has been a work horse for us, but it's time to address it's current deficits: syncing datasets with very long commit chains can take a very long time https://github.com/attic-labs/noms/issues/2233 . nomfs, for example syncing degrades chunk locality within nbs https://github.com/attic-labs/noms/issues/2968 . we need to sync to optimize locality. sync requires staging all data in a temporary store locally before writing into destination. reading with readmanyvalues would dramatically improve perf of syncing from nbs/aws . sync needs a way to sync an arbitrary value to a dataset as opposed to requiring the source to be a commit .
