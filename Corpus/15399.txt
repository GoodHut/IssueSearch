 URL : "https://github.com/learnbyexample/Command-line-text-processing/issues/14" TITLE : do more with less BODY : first, i'm sorry for submitting a pr 11 without reading the readme more closely. just wanted to contribute what i hope will be some useful knowledge to the project. imho, less is a largely underutilized tool that can greatly improve upon, if not replace, the functionality of several other commands--namely cat & tail --as you'll see in my pr. also less is a tool of convenience because how many times have you opened a file with it, then exited less to open it in your editor? yet you can jump straight into your editor from within less ! lastly, you can view multiple files with less in a manner--and keystrokes--akin to changing buffers in vim.
