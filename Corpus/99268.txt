 URL : "https://github.com/bibledit/bibledit/issues/543" TITLE : merged email clarification BODY : this email: saved bible text was merged the bible text you sent to the cloud was not saved exactly as you sent it. it was merged with changes already available in the cloud. ... may need a clarification like this: this one, that the saved bible text was merged is not necessarily an error. it is just an informative email. the cloud merged two different texts into one text. this might be good. just to be sure, it sends this merge result by email, as a kind of double check. the purpose is that the receiver of this email clearly understands that there's nothing to worry about - just to double-check that everything is good.
