BODY : note there is already this issue: https://github.com/choderalab/lab-protocols/issues/35 the main thing from my perspective that needs to be updated is: - adjust label printing so the name is not cut off this email from @mehtapisik is perhaps relevant, maybe @jchodera would want this zip file: ! quantos_label https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6333823/25346186/eec11f4e-28e4-11e7-9e29-3463da60b62c.png in a previous wetlab meeting we decided these were the fields we wanted on the labels in order of priority ideal to have them all on the label, but if they won't fit we want at least primary and secondary details : primary: - substance name - fill date - true concentration - uuid has to be entered by user manually secondary: - supplier - lot - cat less important: - username - expiration date i think @steven-albanese also mentioned: - not using 'safe position' because it is in fact, not very safe. anything else?
