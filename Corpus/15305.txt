 URL : "https://github.com/StrawsonDesign/Robotics_Cape_Installer/issues/49" TITLE : dcan1 rx not read BODY : continuing on configuring dcan as in 48 , it appears that dcanrx is not configured to read properly. i connected the blue to a pre-existing can bus and viewed its output with a logic analyzer. after configuring can0 to the proper bitrate, running candump can0 -l on the blue produces no data, even though traffic was seen on the logic analyzer. with can0 configured with no loopback, writing to the bus fails, as shown below. ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/455381/28694471-5342c9e6-72ef-11e7-8009-61f758310ea0.png after enabling loopback, the blue can successfully write to the bus: ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/455381/28694478-5e825394-72ef-11e7-9a02-a46357858171.png but it follows no arbitration and will write even if the bus is already in use. when the bus then goes to an error state, it ignores it and continues to write. ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/455381/28694420-13d73daa-72ef-11e7-90df-a08404111409.png this is fairly consistent with no actual rx feedback, even though the logic analyzer tied to the rx and tx pins on the blue show proper connection.
