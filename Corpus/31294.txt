 URL : "https://github.com/lcabrini/jfm/issues/3" TITLE : select build system BODY : we should select a build system. i am mostly familiar with make and especially gnu make. but it doesn't seem very popular with java projects. here are the ones that seem popular. 1. ant 1. maven 1. gradle 1. sbt not sure, but maven and gradle seem very enterprisey to me. not really meant for a simple desktop app. sbt is perhaps more popular in the scala community. i have used ant before. much more complex and weird than make, but i guess it gets the job done.
