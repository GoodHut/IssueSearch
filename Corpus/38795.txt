 URL : "https://github.com/qwtel/hydejack/issues/36" TITLE : random sidebar image BODY : i'd like to add an option to use a random sidebar imager by adding something to the front matter. i messed around and was able to get the sidebar to be random if no front matter image was present by putting some code in the my-scripts under the document.getelementbyid '_ypushstate' .addeventlistener 'y-push-state-start', function , but it was missing out on the fade in animation. what would be the best way to achieve this?
