 URL : "https://github.com/rtomrud/whenbot-app/issues/20" TITLE : add undo feature BODY : destructive mistakes may happen by accident due to bad speech recognition or the chatbot interpreting intent incorrectly. those should be easy to reverse with an undo feature. it could be either an undo for only the last action or for all actions performed during the session. consider using immutable state with reducers in the last case. optionally, add redo feature.
