 URL : "https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/1292" TITLE : issue with folded paths BODY : it seems that there are differences in paths. here: https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/tree/master/examples/tutorials/custom-server/gen/restapi/operations have folder: /restapi/operations/ and my app have folder: /restapi/operations/api therefore it's throwing errors about undefined params and func for api handler. importing /restapi/operations/api and renaming func configureapi api into func configureapi apiinstance helped me.
