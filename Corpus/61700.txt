BODY : thank you for the new library. all your hard work is appreciated. is it possible to get fonts around 72pt to work with this library? i created a 72pt roboto black font using http://oleddisplay.squix.ch/ /home url but it ended up only displaying the left hand side of the numerals. 44pt works great. 50 has some issues at the margins time in the pic below but is passable but 72 is mostly incomplete the temp in the pic below. ! _20170726_151744 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24206271/28639421-32de8d4a-7216-11e7-9ddd-537abdb4c6bf.jpg roboto black big fonts.zip https://github.com/squix78/minigrafx/files/1177811/roboto.black.big.fonts.zip
