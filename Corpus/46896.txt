 URL : "https://github.com/dhimmel/integrate/issues/11" TITLE : neo4j open file limit BODY : hi daniel, do you remember what you needed to do to increase the number of concurrent open files allowable by neo4j? at the moment i get a warning that says: warning: max 1024 open files allowed, minimum of 40 000 recommended. see the neo4j manual. starting neo4j server...warning: not changing user process 6305 ... waiting for server to be ready..... ok. http://localhost:7500/ is ready. also, i think they way that neo4j is started with a subprocess call in python is giving me issues, since i trying to start neo4j 3.1.1 in the same manner causes the service to shut down immediately before any python code can be executed.
