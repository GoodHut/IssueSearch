BODY : hi sir, i just took a look at your repo, and observed that you version the .pyc files, which are the result of on-the-fly compilation by python at runtime. you should not version them, they are basically binary files that no normal huma being can read and take advantage of. to remove them, you can do something like: find . -name ' .pyc' -exec git rm {} \; then, to avoid the pain of caring at all in the future, you can add these lines to your .gitignore file: ignore python compiled filed .pyc then you can commit and push, and voil√†! best, a citizen of the 12th.
