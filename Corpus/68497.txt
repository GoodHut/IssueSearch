BODY : hello, maybe i do something wrong, however it seems that sac is wrongly calculated in my case. you can see in the screenshots configuration double tanks 2x12l, start/end air pressure - 150->50bar and avg. depth - 15.7m . according to my simple calculations, sac should be ~23l/min while it subsurface shows 5l/min. i wish it is true, however i it's waay to low value. ! sac1 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13519447/28126627-4e8baa92-672a-11e7-86ec-1bdb44aa8d37.png ! sac2 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13519447/28126626-4e8babc8-672a-11e7-934f-8709b96a8f95.png
