 URL : "https://github.com/pyca/tls/issues/132" TITLE : a new home BODY : hey pyca/tls folks, @alex and i have been conversing recently about the scope of pyca and what's appropriate to live under our banner. we'd like pyca to be more tightly focused due to our limited people power and while this project is a cool idea it's still experimental and will remain so for the foreseeable future. so, i'd like to propose that we move this to its own org for now and as the project matures we can potentially revisit its inclusion. if you have reasons why we shouldn't do this, please let me know!
