 URL : "https://github.com/fisharebest/webtrees/issues/1275" TITLE : select2 bootstrap style BODY : greg as discussed. maybe this will help to fulfill the task as mentioned in 1273 - get the select2-bootstrap-theme to work i was playing around with this issue in a few of my modules where i have a select2 selectbox. this css works in my case. don't know if it works in all cases but it's worth trying: .select2-selection--single, .select2-selection--single .select2-selection__rendered, .select2-selection--single .select2-selection__arrow { height: calc 2.25rem + 2px ; line-height: 2.25; } .input-group .select2-selection--single { border-top-right-radius: 0; border-bottom-right-radius: 0; } and in case you are using sass you could make a mixin of it that's what i did . @mixin select2 { $select: select2-selection--single ; . {$select} { &, & .select2-selection__rendered, & .select2-selection__arrow { height: calc 2.25rem + 2px ; line-height: 2.25; } } .input-group . {$select} { border-top-right-radius: 0; border-bottom-right-radius: 0; } }
