 URL : "https://github.com/opencart/opencart/issues/6189" TITLE : multi language site oc3 BODY : suggestion about multi-language website, for ex. eng/fr; in oc3 we have 2 urls to the same content : when we click domain.com/fr or domain.com/eng they both take you to the same page with default language ; in a normal way it must be: domain.com/fr to fr content and domain.com/eng to eng content. thx
