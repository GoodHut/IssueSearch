 URL : "https://github.com/Kappa-Dev/KaSim/issues/366" TITLE : unclear load order BODY : i have a model in two files. the first declares variables, the second rules. i open the one with variables first. then i open the one with rules. i get an error about illegal use of variables before their declaration. if i change the order and open first the rule file, then the variable file, my cpu utilization goes through the roof and nothing happens for a couple minutes... compiling? should i be opening files in reverse order to their variable declaration order..? i would suggest having a visible indicator that the file-names can be dragged and dropped to arrange the load order, something like this icon https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c92202623481694a52b9f0abd07ba898fa11dcdf/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f4a616667726c502e706e67 . alternatively something more old-school: two buttons, one with an up arrow, the other with a down arrow, that would re-organize the load order of files in a project.
