i will get the participants to make a simple electronic circuit with a breadboard, led and 2 buttons, which will then be programmed using a raspberry pi and edublocks programming language. i have chosen to use edublocks for this because a wider age range will be able to take part with minimal help. what is the goal or outcome of your session?
the outcome of the session is for the participants to have successfully created and programmed an electronic circuit and have a playable quick reaction game. if your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.
my session will require raspberry pi's to deliver the session on. time needed
