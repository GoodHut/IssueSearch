BODY : diff -touch greeter.js psychic.js forloop.js +touch lib/greeter.js lib/psychic.js lib/forloop.js ??? people are going to do this and then not cd .. . we want them to run commands from the root of the repo, not from inside the lib/ directory. i think i may have just talked myself out of it, in that they need to get used to moving around directories, i just know someone's going to mess this up...
