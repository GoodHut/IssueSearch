 URL : "https://github.com/PerformanceVision/ramen/issues/22" TITLE : generate a single binary BODY : containing all the operations in a single binary that would be forked n times instead of n specialized binaries would save a good lot of ram. choose which node to run from the command line. and then, add an option to output directly in some other operation entry point rather than in a ring buffer, if we are the sole writer for that child and reapply recursively . this decision must be taken by ramen not the individual node though, so pass the list of nodes to be called directly in the command line.
