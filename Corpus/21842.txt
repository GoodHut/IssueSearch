 URL : "https://github.com/1001hz/wpnoonan/issues/1" TITLE : header images size BODY : my images are not wide enough for the heading image dimensions. mine are 1200px wide and you said you need 1400px wide. i've put a heading image into the feeling dizzy post as an example and when you look at it on mobile there is a gap to the right hand side. we are stuck with the images we currently have i.e. too late to ask the photographer to take wider potrait shots so is there a way of making the section for the heading images smaller?
