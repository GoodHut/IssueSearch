 URL : "https://github.com/quentin-ol/ngx-openlayers/issues/135" TITLE : displaying gpx data BODY : hey, i am trying to display gpx data in a layer, as in the example on the openlayers website. my code for the layer looks like this: <aol-layer-vector> <aol-source-vector url = 'https://openlayers.org/en/v4.5.0/examples/data/gpx/fells_loop.gpx' > </aol-source-vector> </aol-layer-vector> this throws me the ol-errorcode 7, that says format must be set when url is set . in the example format is set as ol.format.gpx . i've searched a lot, but i haven't found any way to set this format. so is there any way to set format to gpx?
