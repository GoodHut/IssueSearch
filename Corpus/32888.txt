 URL : "https://github.com/northworld/google_calendar/issues/96" TITLE : zone conversion bug BODY : i've run into a bug whereby my results from a find_future_events call gets the right @raw data in response, but the start time conversion to an attribute ignores or does something weird with the zone: @raw= ... start => { datetime => 2017-04-24t10:00:00-04:00 , timezone => america/new_york }, ... @start_time=2017-04-24 14:00:00 utc i'm happy to submit a pull request to fix it but i thought i'd mention it here first in case it's something i'm missing.
