 URL : "https://github.com/UlyssesWu/FreeMote/issues/3" TITLE : support dxt5 texture BODY : dxt5 or even other dxt textures are allowed in emote. i didn't know if someone would use them but at least now i have found one game using dxt5. so i'm going to support it in decompilation. if you have similar issues, post it and provide psb files.
