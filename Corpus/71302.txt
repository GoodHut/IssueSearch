 URL : "https://github.com/StackStorm/ansible-st2/issues/69" TITLE : add centos6 ci in travis BODY : we started adding el support in https://github.com/stackstorm/ansible-st2/pull/65 and https://github.com/stackstorm/ansible-st2/pull/65 as part of https://github.com/stackstorm/ansible-st2/issues/5. working without ci is bad for quality, testing and reviewing. there is a need to add centos6 integration testing in travis as we already do for ubuntu trusty and ubuntu xenial . the framework is already setup. it's possible to make centos6 build non-voting to skip the failure for entire build see travis.yml https://github.com/stackstorm/st2/blob/v2.1.0/.travis.yml l34-l35 example for st2 repo until we re-write all roles to support new platforms. see: https://travis-ci.org/stackstorm/ansible-st2 https://github.com/stackstorm/ansible-st2/blob/master/.travis.yml https://github.com/stackstorm/ansible-st2/blob/master/.kitchen.yml
