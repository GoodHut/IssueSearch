 URL : "https://github.com/Foghrye4/ihl/issues/8" TITLE : muffle furnace recipe bug BODY : problem 1: put one stack of naoh and one stack of bauxite dust inside, after processing there is 1 stack of sodium aluminate and 63 bauxite dust problem 2: this device is very difficult to automate, as it cannot handle the excess of 1 input product, which will fill both slots. i'd also suggest to separate the input and output part for the sake of automation
