 URL : "https://github.com/andrewrothstein/ansible-python/issues/1" TITLE : arch linux support BODY : ansible has started barfing on archlinux test. ansible_distribution is set to arch linux in ansible facts and hence ansible is not able to find vars/archlinux.yml while running first task of finding vars file. should we update the task to look for case-whitespace insensitive filenames? or update the archlinux.yml to arch linux.yml ?
