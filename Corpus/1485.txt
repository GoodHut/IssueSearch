 URL : "https://github.com/vandenheuvel/tribler/issues/314" TITLE : 20 help page BODY : as a user, i want to be able to read details about the visualization, what the circle color represents etc. - remove old question mark button - add 'help' button that changes to 'close' after clicking it - show responsive popover on 'help' button click - add overlay behind the popover so the visualization is less visible and to close the help page on click of overlay. - create the .html content of the popover with .svg's for the visualizations - add explanation text - remove external d3 v4 legend library and write custom code to create the different visualizations: - create circle text legend - create circle color legend - create circle size legend - create line width legend - create line divider legend - make custom scrollbar that fits tribler better ui wise
