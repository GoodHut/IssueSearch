 URL : "https://github.com/open-source-uc/sincding/issues/42" TITLE : file auto-update feature BODY : - x installed node with version >= 8 node -v - x checked other issues describe your problem as a user of sincding, i have to manually update the files that have been modified so i'm constantly downloading files whenever they are modified. i think it would be nice for the app to check whether modification dates between local and remote files match. if the remote file has a newer modification date then the user should be asked how to resolve the conflict because they can have work done on the file that can't be deleted. otherwise keep the local file. right now i'm kind of busy but i can make a pr on december.
