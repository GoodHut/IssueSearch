 URL : "https://github.com/openSNP/snpr/issues/406" TITLE : links to tabs don't work BODY : linking to specific tabs doesn't work right now. e.g. https://opensnp.org/snps/rs7903146 plos should take you to the plos-paper tab, but that doesn't work. same is true for linking to a users personal message page: we're trying to link back to a user's inbox at https://opensnp.org/users/1 messages after sending a message in the message_controller https://github.com/opensnp/snpr/blob/master/app/controllers/messages_controller.rb l24 but that fails right now. seems some js there isn't working as it's supposed to.
