 URL : "https://github.com/Azurency/CQUI_Community-Edition/issues/239" TITLE : automatic unit cycling BODY : when unit a finishes it's moves and automatic unit cycling is on, the game will sometimes momentarily shift to unit b for a split second before switching to unit c and allowing you to perform unit c's moves. this sometimes causes problems where the user will mis-input a command intended for unit b instead to unit c. it often does this repeatedly, and between after every unit's moves, it will switch to unit b before switching again to unit d, e, f, etc.
