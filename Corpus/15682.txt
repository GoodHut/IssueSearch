 URL : "https://github.com/liresearch/climate/issues/13" TITLE : figure 2 tas axes BODY : when looking at the new plot for figure 2 that was produced to address issue 11, i noticed something else that we might want to fix. do we want the tas axes to have the same limits for each plot, or at least for each plot in the same row of plots? if someone wants to compare the different plots, it is difficult, because the limits vary between -30 to 25, -10 to 25, -25 to 20 etc. if a comparison between plots is not really part of the point, please feel free to close this issue without any modification to the figure.
