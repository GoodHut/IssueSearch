 URL : "https://github.com/Elgg/Elgg/issues/11174" TITLE : view should be autonomous BODY : for testability views need to be autonomous, the following conventions should apply and be documented: - use elgg_extract or isset when working with $vars - always validate object instances before calling object methods, e.g. make sure it's elggblog before calling getexcerpt - never trust any values, never too much validation - it should be possible to call elgg_view on any view with an empty array of $vars and get an empty string back - get rid of forward from views : we should probably add http exceptions and start throwing instead
