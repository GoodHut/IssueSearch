 URL : "https://github.com/ErikEJ/SqlCeToolbox/issues/432" TITLE : improve ef core rev eng BODY : i would like a feature to just refresh the ef core database generation. for example, let's say i generate a dbcontext using ef core generation. i put it in the tables, namespace, and folder. if something changes in the db and i would like to update/refresh it, i need to manually input dbcontextname, namespace, and folder all over again. this can get troublesome. so, i would like it to either: remember my previous dbcontextname, namespace, and folder... or let me do the generation via commandline so i can copy and paste connection string, context name, namespace, and folder
