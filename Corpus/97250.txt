 URL : "https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck/issues/1184" TITLE : further options for tslint BODY : when i use tslint with type-check-required rules, i need to give some options like --project <path/to/tsconfig.json> --type-check . but at least i try, there is no way to give such options to flycheck-typescript-tslint. is there any way to do so? if not, could you add some customizable variable for this?
