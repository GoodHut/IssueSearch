 URL : "https://github.com/AdmitHub/meteor-buildpack-horse/issues/171" TITLE : first deployment sticks BODY : app works perfectly, i use meteor_settings, buildpack_prelaunch_meteor, buildpack_url, root_url, but the code and all files are the one i deployed first time, each deployment it never changes. - is there any bundle folder to delete ? - or buildhorse can set a variable to clear cache ? meteor@1.4.4.2 build to heroku last buildpack version
