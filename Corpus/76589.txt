 URL : "https://github.com/HearthSim/HSReplay.net/issues/265" TITLE : link to deck from replay BODY : when the user is viewing a replay it would be nice to be able to look up the deck that the user or his opponent used during the match. the deck information page is incredibly useful but there's currently no way to find it for the particular deck that you're playing or playing against.
