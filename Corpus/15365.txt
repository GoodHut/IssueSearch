 URL : "https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-css/issues/302" TITLE : deprecate aspairs BODY : currently we recommend people use elm-css in one of three ways: 1. compile to a .css file 2. compile to a string and use a <style> tag 3. compile to key/value pairs with aspairs and create a style attribute i think supporting the third one no longer makes sense, and aspairs should be deprecated. the benchmarks i've seen - some of which are linked in https://github.com/elm-lang/virtual-dom/issues/112 - make it pretty clear that the style attribute is poor choice for general styling as opposed to maybe for dynamic animations, arguably, in some cases , which is the major css frameworks in the js ecosystem have moved away from it. on top of this, there have always been issues with this approach. hover will compile to aspairs just fine, but it won't actually work when you run it because <style> supports pseudo-classes but the style attribute doesn't. also, style attributes have their own elevated level of specificity, so they don't play nicely with any other sources of styles you might want to incorporate - resets, polyfills, bootstrap, etc. i think there are good reasons to support both compiling to a .css file and generating styles at runtime, but i want elm-css to offer only two options: either use a <style> element, or use the cli to generate a .css file.
