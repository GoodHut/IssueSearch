 URL : "https://github.com/nextcloud/passman-webextension/issues/81" TITLE : os' keyring integration BODY : actually that's a huge feature request and maybe not possible yet , but it would be nice if the master password could also be saved in the os' keyring macos or most linux desktop environments â€“ gnome, kde, e.g. instead of in plain-text in a text file. this way, it would be protected and tied to the user account 's password . this of course requires that browsers support a general abstract keyring integration for webextensions, which works independently from the os. if that is not the case yet, we should urge them to implement this. this is explicitly also an aim of this issue. i think this add-on is a perfect example on why such a webextension api would be very useful.
