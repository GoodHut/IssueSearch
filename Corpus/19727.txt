 URL : "https://github.com/Fweeb/dillo/issues/1" TITLE : add tagging system BODY : i think one feature that's really missing is post tags. i'm not sure what the best way to do it would be, as far as i can tell there are two approaches: 1. a post is in a particular category and can multiple tags 2. post's can be in multiple categories i.e. the categories become the tags something else to think about too would be to have special tags . for example, a developer could tag a proposal as accepted , denied , on hold , etc. that could allow for a more structured way for developers to interact with the site. i haven't thought through the tagging system too much yet, but i think it's a pretty important feature to have.
