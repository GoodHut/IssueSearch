 URL : "https://github.com/CQUI-Org/cqui/issues/591" TITLE : summer patch 2017 BODY : as always, we'll be using a master thread to address the new patch. please report any new patch-related issues here and _not_ as a standalone issue. here's the basic protocol: i'm going to first review existing prs. i'd like to merge as much as possible before consolidating the new changes patch related fixes and changes are going to the new summer-2017 branch first once the majority of the new patch issues have been addressed, the summer-2017 branch will be merged into master and ongoing issues from this issue will be given their own standalone tickets. assuming the linux/osx version is behind again... a separate osx-linux branch has been created which won't eventually be inheriting the summer-2017 patch branch. we'll be backporting commits to this branch at regular intervals until the linux/osx version is caught up again. the osx/linux workshop page will also be reactivated for the purposes of serving this version
