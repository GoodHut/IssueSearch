 URL : "https://github.com/watilde/dep/issues/1" TITLE : drop privileges as root BODY : the readme states: > to avoid from the risks related the lifecycle install scripts of the package while installing, dep doesn't allow you to run them if you are running dep install as a root user. however a better thing to do in this case is to just drop privileges to e.g. nobody . this is what npm does and it actually ends up being _more_ secure to run as the root user, since if you run as your regular user then lifecycle scripts have access to everything you do. side note, this looks like a really interesting project - good luck <3
