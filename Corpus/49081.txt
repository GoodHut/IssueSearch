 URL : "https://github.com/LongSoft/UEFITool/issues/91" TITLE : support for skylake-x BODY : hey guys, if i try to patch my bios with uefipatch, the kabylake patch gets applied. could be because of kabylake-x support on my motherboard, i don't know. what i do know, is that after flashing the bios, msr 0xe2 is still locked. so whatever the kabylake patch did, it did not unlock my 0xe2. my guess would be that an x299 path will be closer to the x99 broadwell-e patch. any idea how to find a new patch? sadly, reverse engineering uefi is way above my head. any help is appreciated. thank you. m
