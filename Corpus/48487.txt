 URL : "https://github.com/react-component/tabs/issues/59" TITLE : scrollable tabs issue BODY : hi paranoidjk, i have came across an issue related to scrollable tabs. i have ui such as parent tabs with tabbarposition:'left' and child tabs with tabbarposition:'top'. i want to make child tab as scrollableinktabbar so i can scroll it horizontally. the issue is due to parent tab having tabbarposition:'left', the scroll navigation is not visible some how. if i change parent tabbarposition to 'top' then scroll navigation is visible perfectly. hence, i strongly feel there is some issue while we set parent tab position to 'left'. please do the needful regards, romil
