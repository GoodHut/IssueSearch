 URL : "https://github.com/armon/go-chord/issues/12" TITLE : lookup out of order BODY : using the current test case testlookup i've noticed that the vnodes returned are not in order. in the case of a 7 successor lookup the first 4 are in order and the last 3 are in order but the last 3 should be in front of the first 4. here's the augmented testlookup run showing the above: go test -v -cover . -run 'testlookup$' === run testlookup --- fail: testlookup 0.20s chord_test.go:281: out of order c466d6e2d54b12c76928f3e110d42551fb6ff2bb eba66e55991a6f5dc07bafb9b0ef2fc88ade4e08 f3cff23418a9c7096e54ef2e06f630e5fb24d6f5 fa3895449ffadaf8cbcc4e14810d7cfbbe6862c6 0bfc1b98f29803535fb37a08a9781f3cd8f0c345 43542cfc2f7e272cef64cb29249c555d2dd0bca6 55096e5a670ffc5904611b4ebf7bda3305a6c2a8 chord_test.go:282: out of order fa3895449ffadaf8cbcc4e14810d7cfbbe6862c6 0bfc1b98f29803535fb37a08a9781f3cd8f0c345 further i've also noticed that a single node ring will yield an out of order lookup as above even after stabilization, but once the second node has joined the lookups are then correct. i wanted to make sure i wasn't missing anything before i start working out a fix. please let me know. thank you in advance.
