 URL : "https://github.com/glushchenko/fsnotes/issues/68" TITLE : want to use cmd+j BODY : i want the shortcut to bring fsnotes to the front to be cmd+j because that's what i used with notational velocity and i have strong muscle memory for it. but when i try to set it in fsnotes i get a popup saying: this shortcut cannot be used because it is already used by the menu item ‘jump to selection’. i want to override that and do it anyway. not crticial obviously as i can just learn a new shortcut.
