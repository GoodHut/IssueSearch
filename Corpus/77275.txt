 URL : "https://github.com/nextcloud/nextcloudpi/issues/290" TITLE : multi languages for ncp? BODY : hey nacho & crew ;- ncp is still growing in features and reach the state of devine , i guess ; and so it's difficult to improve it or coming up with random thoughts about improvement... what about this one and as usual i dunno how difficult it might be to implement it ... - getting ncp translated into different languages using transifex like nextcloud server and several apps do ? i know of several users who don't feel well doing it all in english and so running and setting ncp up in their native tongues would be of an enormous help for them. this is clearly an enhancement. but i only can mark this one as an issue cheers jimmy
