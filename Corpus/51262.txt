 URL : "https://github.com/FoundationMedicineInc/oracle-sage/issues/11" TITLE : add wrapper to execute BODY : would be nice to expose a sage.execute that wraps around oracle.execute . something like this. sage.execute = sql, bindparams = , options = {} => { logger.debug sql ; let connection; let results; return sage.getconnection .then c => connection = c .then => connection.execute sql, bindparams, options .then r => { results = r; return sage.releaseconnection connection ; } .then => results // return the results .catch err => { sage.releaseconnection connection ; throw err ; } ; }
