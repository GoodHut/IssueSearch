 URL : "https://github.com/denismerigoux/wasm2cretonne/issues/1" TITLE : can't build it BODY : bonjour, it appears i can't build this with cargo build , because the frontend branch on your cretonne fork is actually missing. any chance you could push it? also, is that correct that the binary utility in src displays the wast and cil? is there a way to enable only displaying the cil? disclaimer, i'm looking into feeding valid random wasm binaries to wasm2cretonne and then pass the cil files to cretonne
