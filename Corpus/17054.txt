 URL : "https://github.com/JiaweiZhuang/xESMF/issues/7" TITLE : need a test suite BODY : progress seems to be moving forward here quite nicely. i'm sensing a growing acknowledgement that the approach you are developing may be the path forward for many in the xarray/geoscience community. that said, to be fully adopted by the community, xesmf is going to need a comprehensive test suite. i'll suggest three key components: 1. continuous integration e.g. travisci https://travis-ci.org/ 2. unit tests e.g. pytest https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/ 3. benchmarks e.g. asv https://asv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ if you are not familiar with how to work with these tools, xarray is going to be a good reference and i think you'll find many of us are willing to chip in.
