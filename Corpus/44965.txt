 URL : "https://github.com/hyperapp/hyperapp/issues/185" TITLE : get rid of stack in h BODY : let's continue on this topic here. so, from what i see in hyperxify examples https://github.com/substack/hyperxify/blob/master/example/vdom.js , they are using virtual-dom https://github.com/matt-esch/virtual-dom . virtual-dom does not seem to handle nested children: https://github.com/matt-esch/virtual-dom/blob/master/virtual-hyperscript/index.js. my guess is that those nested children are only text nodes, but when a real node is met, a h call is made. given the fact that virtual-dom does not handle this, i'm pretty confident we could get rid of this. @jbucaran how could we validate that it's not mandatory?
