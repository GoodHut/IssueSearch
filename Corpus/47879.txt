 URL : "https://github.com/J05HI/DeezLoadr/issues/69" TITLE : question gui features BODY : what can we expect for the gui in terms of features? would it be more like deezloader, where you can search tracks, top lists, albums, and playlists in the program? or would it stay more like it is right now maybe with some options however ? not trying to be pushy, but i'd like to know whether to keep developing my seperate version of deezloader ðŸ˜ƒ
