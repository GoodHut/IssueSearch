 URL : "https://github.com/moqui/moqui-framework/issues/281" TITLE : new ui interaction is need BODY : i would like simply to show or hide some fields within a form-single and even a containers out of the form-single depends on a drop-down, radio or checkbox. as the flt template didn't support the onchanged even for radio, checkbox, yet, i need to do it by js, but the html for a field only has a class attr like <div class= form-group >. it has no id attr.
