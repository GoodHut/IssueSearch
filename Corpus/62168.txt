 URL : "https://github.com/yiffparty/tracker/issues/4" TITLE : categories system tweak BODY : i think current categories system should be tweaked better. currently it lacks fundamental tags. primo - artists should be divided by gender categories what gender or combination they mostly use . i propose two solutions: 1. staight hetero , gay homo , optional categories: both, other 2. male, female, herm and both or other second classification by type of work: digital art, traditional art, cgi, animations, games, stories i strongly encourage admin to check categories on furaffinity, deviantart, boorus e621 etc and choose system best suiting yp.
