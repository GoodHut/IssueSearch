 URL : "https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions.github.io/issues/1" TITLE : site currently 404ing BODY : this may just be a dns issue on github's part but we may want to check the cname file. my recommendation would be to have the cname point to fluentassertions.com and then use your dns provider to add a cname pointing to fluentassertions.github.io . below is how i do this on cloudflare for seankilleen.com , which runs via seankilleen/seankilleen.github.io : ! image https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2148318/23622353/481039c6-026c-11e7-89b0-cc7d9a06f1e5.png note: it's possible this just might need a second for dns updates to propagate, etc. you also might want to make sure in the settings of this repo that github pages is enabled and that it's deploying from master .
