 URL : "https://github.com/typora/typora-issues/issues/888" TITLE : add support for katex? BODY : hoping typora can add support for katex , which is the fastest math typesetting library for the web. and it's also better than mathjax in many other aspects. see webpage https://khan.github.io/katex/ ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20089973/30103913-abca02ee-9326-11e7-986e-cd9cfcf6364a.png the most desirable feature for me is the printing quality, which is just the same as latex not svg for both html and printed pdf . any plans for this? many thanks!
