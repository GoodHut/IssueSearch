 URL : "https://github.com/broadinstitute/pilon/issues/62" TITLE : gatk indel realigner BODY : hi, i know that gatk haplotypecaller does not require indel realignment as it locally re-assemble the genome. however, pilon does not seem to have such re-assembling step. does the pilon have indel realignment itself? could running gatk indel realigner prior to pilon enhance the polishing quality of pilon? thanks
