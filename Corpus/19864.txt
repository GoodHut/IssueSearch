 URL : "https://github.com/gskinner/regexr/issues/186" TITLE : anchors don't work BODY : anchors don't seem to be working for me. they work on this site: http://scriptular.com/, but not regexr. i'm trying to run this expression: ^1?\s? \ ?\d{3}\ ? \s|- ? \d{3} \s|- ? \d{4} $ i get no matches for these strings: 555-555-5555 555 555-5555 555 555-5555 even though they match on scriptular. not sure if it matters, but i'm on linux + chromium.
