 URL : "https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop/issues/522" TITLE : request: a changelog BODY : related to 507 . ❤️ laptop and thoughtbot open source. it would be really nice to have a clear sense of what has changed. i happened to notice in the readme that this project switched to using asdf which is cool, but i'll have to dig through the commits to see what else has changed since last i used laptop. may i suggest adding a pr template with a checklist item of updating the changelog?
