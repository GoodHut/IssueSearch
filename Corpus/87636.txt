 URL : "https://github.com/Arkq/bluez-alsa/issues/27" TITLE : loss of frames with pjsip BODY : hello and tia for good work! i try to use _pjsua_ sip application from _pjsip_ library with latest version of bluez-alsa sco profile . the sound always interrupt, the conversation example here http://www.filedropper.com/output_19 . i have some suspicions with incorrect buffer length of the buffer or drop the buffer before it finish. the cpu load for _pjsua_ is about 10% and 5% for _bluez-alsa_. so the problem is not performance. _aplay_ works fine on the same system with _bluez-alsa_, _pjsua_ also works fine on the same system with _pulseaudio_. how to debug and fix this error? if to set _pcm->frame_size_ to 15 bytes calculated as 16 in _bluealsa_hw_params_ function, the sound is almost continuous, but cracks appear.
