 URL : "https://github.com/rasanga/FlashAlertBundle/issues/17" TITLE : twig deprecation warning BODY : just after installing your bundle in my symfony 3.2 project, i got this deprecation warning: the twig_function_method class is deprecated since version 1.12 and will be removed in 2.0. use twig_simplefunction instead. this is because you use the twig_function_method class in vendor/ras/flash-alert-bundle/ras/bundle/flashalertbundle/twig/flashalertsextension.php:47,50 are you planning to fix this? thanks in advance! :
