 URL : "https://github.com/alexpdraper/reading-list/issues/51" TITLE : compact table view BODY : vertical screen-space is quite valuable, as widescreens don't offer as much, as it used to be. please allow for an advanced table-view. i'd like any link, to take only a single line in the hight of the standard-font e.g. like the menu items . though the structure should be tabular, don't draw lines, boxes, shadows and all the fancy bling-bling-stuff, just the data and maybe an alternating background, or a colored highlight on mouse hover. in addition, i'd like more columns: - icon - title - domain - url - date added - time added clicking the column header should sort the list by that column, keeping a previous sort. the search could support an expression-language to address certain fields: time: 9pm-10pm and title: ^hello\s world$ of course, sort-order and filter should persist, until changed / reset.
