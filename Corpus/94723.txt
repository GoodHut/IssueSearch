 URL : "https://github.com/cahirwpz/mimiker/issues/286" TITLE : cirrus logic gd5446 driver BODY : we do have a vga driver ready, but it only supports the qemu stdvga device. ovpsim does not provide any device like that one, the only vga available for ovpsim is a cirrus logic gd5445. we'll need to implement support for it as a separate driver, with significantly different logic than the stdvga driver it won't be able to use neither vbe nor bochs extensions , and will have to use isa ioports, as support for mmio via bar2 is not implemented . the new driver should conform to the ./include/vga.h interface.
