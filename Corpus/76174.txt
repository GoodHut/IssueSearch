 URL : "https://github.com/memcached/memcached/issues/279" TITLE : install from github repo BODY : hello, sorry to bother you. i am a newbie to automake and rpm. recently i want to build a rpm package for our centos machines from the lastest source. i know if i want to mannully install i should first download the lastest release wget https://github.com/memcached/memcached/archive/1.4.36.tar.gz then ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make && make install my first question is how to generate spec file from .spec.in . i also notice the tarball file downloaded by the following command already includes the final configure and spec file wget https://memcached.org/latest so my second question is what's the difference between tarball from github release and the one from https://memcached.org/latest. i am really confused. anyone who can help me?
