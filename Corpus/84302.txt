 URL : "https://github.com/bugflow/auto-gnome/issues/10" TITLE : create triagenurse plugin BODY : after 9, the sortinghat plugin will fill the intray of the traigenurse. so we want a triagenurse plugin that periodically nags the triage nurse etc when there is sorting to do. requires more analysis, but for example: notify slack traige_nurse channel when new tickets are in the sorting hat notify slack direct message to triage nurse gentle reminder about action required notify slack general channel mild panic when very old tickets need sorting this plugin requires some parameters in .gnome.yml : the intray milestone to monitor e.g. sorting hat botty mcbotface endpoint errbot and the botty mcbotface bot service needs configuration to know stuff like: the list of triage nurse s ? triage_nurse channel? errbot service endpoint?
