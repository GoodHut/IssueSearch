 URL : "https://github.com/ValveSoftware/halflife/issues/1781" TITLE : edge case in com_filebase BODY : com_filebase https://github.com/valvesoftware/halflife/blob/5d761709a31ce1e71488f2668321de05f791b405/cl_dll/hud.cpp l537 has an edge case when the given string does not contain any slashes. in that case, the start variable will become -1, the code will then read from the input string -1, which can result in an access violation if that memory is not allocated. a simple check to interpret -1 as needing to start from 0 should suffice here.
