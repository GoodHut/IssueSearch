 URL : "https://github.com/tasks/tasks/issues/614" TITLE : notification does not work BODY : i am running the latest beta from the play store on android 7.0. i set a task reminder as ring non stop. i have added an exception in the battery optimization settings. however, no matter what combination of settings i add the notification does not buzz continuously, and is definitely not persistent. even after turning on the persistent setting, the notification does not remain on screen for more than a few seconds. i had initially installed the stable version and it didn't work. to check whether it was a version problem, i joined the beta channel on the play store. however, the problem is there even on the beta version.
