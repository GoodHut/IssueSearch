BODY : in base.js: onadd = e, val = null => { e.preventdefault ; this.add utils.isevent val ? null : val ; }; this passes val , which can be null , into utils.isevent . this reads as follows: const isevent = obj => { if typeof event === 'undefined' return false; return obj instanceof event || !_.isnil obj.target ; // eslint-disable-line }; this returns true if obj is an instance of the event, or if obj.target is not nill. but what happens when obj is null ? it would fail because null.target doesn't work. i'm trying to debug a bug that seems to hit this, and it only shows up when i do a production build, not during development. i don't know why i'm hitting it now and not before, as i haven't updated any dependencies. it's a mystery. but nonetheless, this looks like a bug, correct?
