 URL : "https://github.com/mrharicot/monodepth/issues/26" TITLE : video as input BODY : hi, i was trying to understand the way you structured your code. after having a careful look at your code, it seems that your code is structured in a way that it accepts all the test images their names in filenames at once during the call of dataloader = monodepthdataloader args.data_path, args.filenames_file, params, args.dataset, args.mode then based on the loaded data files, you load the model using model = monodepthmodel params, args.mode, left, right finally when you run the session, i assume it gets the image using the filename and generates the output. i dont really get what exactly model.disp_left_est 0 denotes in the call = sess.run model.disp_left_est 0 can you please help me understand the structure of the code for mode=test. i want to modify the code to receive video as input and generate disparity video as output using moviepy. understanding the code structure will really help me in this regard. thank you
