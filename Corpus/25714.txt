 URL : "https://github.com/unicef/etools-issues/issues/282" TITLE : action point header BODY : the field set title for action points displays 1 by default even though there isn't any action point assigned. see screenshot this creates confusion as if there is an action point added but the system fails to display. expected behaviour : field set title for action points should read only action points without the 1 , if the user hadn't added any action points.
