BODY : would be cool to have possibility to refresh the points in live by example, we could have a file with all entries on server in linking with your example, something like 0, incredible arial shots , 13, good morning lancaster , 25, sugartv , 37, the la1 show , 56, soundbooth , 75, jailbreak , 87, charity showcase , 96, strictly cha cha chat! , 102, roses , 116, the studio! , 167, closing sequence and js would have to check this file each x seconds to update the player i think about that cause in vod, ok it's easy but during a live you don't know how to put markers or maybe you have a better solution i'm not an expert ;- nico
