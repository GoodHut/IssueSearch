 URL : "https://github.com/ttoohey/laravel-graphql-filter/issues/3" TITLE : filter or wherehas BODY : i think filter should be called wherehas because everything is filer. when you choose certain attribute names for output that is filter. when you choose certain attribute values to filter query that is a filter too. in my oppition your directive should be called wherehas, because word filter is too general and alredy used.
