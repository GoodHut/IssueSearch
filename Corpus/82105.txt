 URL : "https://github.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/issues/53" TITLE : add fixers to a few rules BODY : the following rules can be automatically fixed with eslint --fix , when fixers are added. checktypes newline-after-description require-description-complete-sentence require-hyphen-before-param-description my project just started using eslint, doing require-description-complete-sentence manually is a pain so we don't use it for now. if i have free time i might open a pull request for at least some of these. @gajus what do you think?
