 URL : "https://github.com/Ventero/FRESteamWorks/issues/39" TITLE : how do i change the appid? BODY : after struggling to run the example from the command line, i managed to get the example working by making an fla file in flash cc, setting fresteamworkstest as the document class, and adding the latest ane file from http://dump.ventero.de/fresteamworks/ as a library. however, the appid is stuck as 480. creating a steam_appid.txt file and trying to set the id there has no effect. i can't find the number 480 referenced anywhere in the example. so how am i supposed to change the appid? help would be appreciated.
