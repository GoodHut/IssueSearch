 URL : "https://github.com/nickgeoca/cwt-tensorflow/issues/1" TITLE : wavelet might be reversed BODY : trying to figure this out, but it looks like a convolution flips the kernel around. if this is the case, then this lib has a bug. it should flip the kernel around before it passes it to the convolution function, so it ends up correct. this did not appear as a bug because the ricker wavelet is symmetric. i would like confirmation from a math guy. the convolution is t-b , while the cwt is b-t . note, this is confusing, but the t variable in the convolution is the b variable in the cwt. convolution equation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/convolution ! https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a85f42436daa9e0bc3586e8d5374b5fa17c87f63?raw=true cwt equation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/continuous_wavelet_transform ! https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/177ea0d98fe8fd8a9432b45668881857a0702b7a?raw=true
