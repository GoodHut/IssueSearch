 URL : "https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-library/issues/885" TITLE : klc and text width BODY : hi! one thing i noted when playing around with the klc scripts: currently we require a linewidth of 0.12mm for courtyard and 0.1mm for fabrication layer, but text on both should have a thickness of 0.15mm ... so: 1. should we match the text linewidth to the linewidth on the respective layer, or leave it as it is which looks good to me from an Ã¤sthetic standpoint! 2. should we mention this in the rules? jan
