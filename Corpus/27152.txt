 URL : "https://github.com/josueeduardo/rest-client/issues/1" TITLE : conventions & howto BODY : great job with this fork. just pointing, that you could somehow differ from original mashape version. the issue is, how you will proceed, when they create 1.4.10 version? it might have functional clash. i'd propose slight name update unirested-java or somehing like that, and start release from 1.0. or if you plan to make all your contribution inherited from their, make it somehow like 1.1_4_9.1 next 1.1_4_9.2 etc. or are you officially successor of their work, and they do not plan to continue? thanks.
