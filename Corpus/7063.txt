 URL : "https://github.com/pureconfig/pureconfig/issues/204" TITLE : custom key name BODY : if i understood correctly what is described din the field-mappings page https://github.com/pureconfig/pureconfig/blob/master/docs/override-behaviour-for-case-classes.md field-mappings , pureconfig allows to define a mapping between a key naming convention and another one for scala fields. however what it if keys are named with a mixed named convention ? i think it could be nice to annotate case class fields to provide a specific key name like: case class dummy @typesafeconfigkey bla_bla blabla: foo thanks!
