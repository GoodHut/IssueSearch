 URL : "https://github.com/slide-rs/specs/issues/148" TITLE : unique entity id BODY : hi! it would be great, to have something like impl entity { ... /// returns the unique id of the entity . inline pub fn get_uid &self -> i64 { self.1 .0 as i64 | self.0 as i64 << 32 } ... or: impl entity { ... /// returns the unique id of the entity . inline pub fn get_gen_id &self -> i32 { self.1 .0 } ... because now, generation id field is private, and create component for storing unique id of every entity looks like overhead.
