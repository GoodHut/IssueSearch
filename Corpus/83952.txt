 URL : "https://github.com/GowaniPumpSupply/gowanipump.github.io/issues/26" TITLE : configure travis properly BODY : travis should be told to only build when a .travis.yml file is present, that way the builds won't fail for now. but later, it should run some type of real tests at the very least you should be linting . also, add a travis badge to your readme so the build status is visible. it's currently assuming that you have a ruby project that's the default and it's causing the builds to fail.
