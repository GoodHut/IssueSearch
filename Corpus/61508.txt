 URL : "https://github.com/neuropoly/axonsegpy/issues/23" TITLE : axonseg csv outputs bug BODY : so i run main.py with test.json, it now seems to work the output image looks ok , but how come i have only 2 axons in the axon csv ? also, are there other ways to convert your axonlist object to a data structure csv is good, but not very practical if we want to calculate more metrics from the segmentation .
