 URL : "https://github.com/Lynx3d/pylotro/issues/5" TITLE : ddo update 36 patch 2 BODY : with the recent update of 36.2 for ddo pylotro the ddo client may produce a blank screen when trying to log in thru using the pylotro client. renaming the dndclient.exe to something else and then changing the dndclient_awesomium.exe to dndclient.exe is a work around at this time. could an option be added to the pylotro client to tick a box so that it chooses the awesomium executable in the future should subsequent patches cause these types of issues?
