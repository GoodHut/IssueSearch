 URL : "https://github.com/brbeaird/SmartThings_MyQ/issues/24" TITLE : error saving unnamed page BODY : had been using the app for a while, but one of the doors was stuck in “opening” mode. i figured i’d just delete it and re-add it, but when i get to the final stage to add the door i recieve an error that says “error saving unnamed page. please contact the smartapp developer.” any ideas?
