 URL : "https://github.com/Praqma/git-phlow/issues/260" TITLE : git wrapup --no-add BODY : it would be very useful if git wrapup had a switch to prevent it from adding files. this would allow me to craft my own commit i.e. add only the files or hunks i want but still use the power of wrapup to do the actual commit message and commit. for completeness there should be a --add switch as well to revert the --no-add behaviour if for instance it has been aliased. ideally, there should be a config option for add/no-add behaviour, but that is probably for a separate future issue.
