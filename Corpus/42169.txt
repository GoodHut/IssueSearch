 URL : "https://github.com/pombase/canto/issues/1361" TITLE : alleles of type other BODY : the standard allele types are amino_acid_mutation deletion disruption nonsense_mutation nucleotide_mutation other partial_amino_acid_deletion partial_nucleotide_deletion unknown unrecorded wild_type during the pombase load we create a log file of all of the allele types described as other the file is here https://curation.pombase.org/dumps/latest_build/logs/log.2017-11-12-21-23-09.alleles_of_type_other the plan is to create new types we have some new proposed allele types and merges where we split unecessarily : https://github.com/pombase/canto/issues/1275 https://github.com/pombase/canto/issues/976 diploids we plan to handle this more robustly, most of our experiments are in haploids, so it hasn't become urgent yet, may need for phi-canto? please add any new types required for phi base to this ticket @cuzicka @hammond-kosack
