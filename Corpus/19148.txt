 URL : "https://github.com/JohanDegraeve/iosxdripreader/issues/14" TITLE : xdrip g4 w/ wixel BODY : i've tried version 1.0.3 and 0.52 and haven't been able to get nightscout to update with any data. in both versions the calibration button never appears, so i'm not sure it's receiving data. bluetooth is ok. - the app appears to connect to nightscout ok - the wixel connects quickly in .52 the bluetooth icon is green, in 1.0.3 the status is connected - i've tried selecting g4 as the transmitter and have entered the id of the actual transmitter or left it as 0000 though i don't see why i'd need that? the wixel has that value hardcoded . - i've started and stopped the sensor, restarted the app, used airplane mode. i've also tried changing the start time of the sensor in case that's the problem. oh, for the record, i also had trouble setting the high value in mmol format. i had to change the unit to mgdl, enter a number, then switch back to mmol. i've used a developer id to resign the apps, so testing different versions isn't a problem. thanks
