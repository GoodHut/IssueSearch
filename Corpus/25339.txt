 URL : "https://github.com/wp-cli/extension-command/issues/33" TITLE : wp plugin download BODY : would really like to see wp plugin download for downloading the zip file of plugins without installing them. this would allow me auto-download updates for archival, which i am pretty much doing by hand. obviously it would only work with plugins that support updates through the dashboard. by default it would not override an existing file unless the downloaded version is newer. with an option for --override to force a download anyway. and a --path= would be nice as well.
