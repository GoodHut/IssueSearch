 URL : "https://github.com/daniel-luberda/DLToolkit.Forms.Controls/issues/83" TITLE : selected item style BODY : hi daniel, i've been using your flow list view control and it's been awesome so far. i do have one question for you. i've got a column template that looks like this: <flv:flowlistview.flowcolumntemplate> <datatemplate> <button text= {binding value} fontsize= micro widthrequest= 100 verticaloptions= fill margin= 0,0,10,0 command= {binding source={x:reference name=inspectionworkflow}, path=bindingcontext.selectworkflowitemvaluecommand} commandparameter= {binding value} /> </datatemplate> </flv:flowlistview.flowcolumntemplate> i'd like the selected item to highlight in some way so the user can easily determine which button they've clicked. i tried setting the flowtappedbackgroundcolor, but that didn't seem to work. can you clue me in on the trick to get this sort of thing working? thanks ...
