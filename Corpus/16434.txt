 URL : "https://github.com/Astray-git/vue-dragula/issues/42" TITLE : input loses focus BODY : i found that when using <input> , the focus is lost on model update. on every key stroke the focus is lost and i have to click back into the input for every subsequent keystroke. it doesn't happen on native dragula from what i can tell. <div class= container v-dragula= colone bag= first-bag > <div v-for= i, text in colone > {{text}} click me <input v-model= colone i /> </div> </div>
