 URL : "https://github.com/nortikin/sverchok/issues/1456" TITLE : docs with images BODY : because we have a .gitignore that ignores the content of certain directories, we never push documentation images to the main repo. to keep repo size small. lately people have been asking for downloadable docs with images. what we currently offer does not automatically provide this. i have made https://github.com/sverchok/sverchok_docs in an attempt to get images in the automatically generated offline files. ---- there's a slight caveat here, this means the docs will unless a nicer solution presents itself be in two places. - the most up-to-date but without images will be in the current sverchok repo. - periodically upon rst changes we should push the changes to sverchok/sverchok_docs and do a make html to get the images. and then build the docs on readthedocs.io
