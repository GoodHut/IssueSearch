 URL : "https://github.com/webpack-contrib/babili-webpack-plugin/issues/41" TITLE : invalid option test BODY : hi, when using the plugin like that: new babiliplugin { options: { test: /\.jsx?$/i, comments: false, sourcemap: true } } and then running webpack compilation, this error shows up in the terminal: error: invalid option test this error is actually thrown by the babel-preset-babili module. i had to revert to the 0.0.11 version in order to make it work again. i'm using webpack version 2.6.0. thanks
