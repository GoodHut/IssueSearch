 URL : "https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc-test-automation/issues/1110" TITLE : remove clear /tmp/esel BODY : input from @anoo1 clear /tmp/esel - what is the purpose of this test case? this is the location of the intermediate esel chunks that the host sends and its location should not be of concerned to the user, in fact we can change the file or implementation at any time without expecting test cases to be affected. @swe12345 please remove from rqm and also from the code.. thanks
