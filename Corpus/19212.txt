BODY : this is a fabulous utility. since dns resolution is supported for target, it might be handy to have a -4 and -6 options to force ipv4 or ipv6 for the target. my output: $ python3 nsidenumerator.py b.root-servers.net found 1 servers b'b2-lax' statistics total dns queries : 1 timeouts : 0 percent failed queries : 0.00 warnings none i was wondering which protocol this hit, so i had run again each time for the v4 and v6 addresses. $ python3 nsidenumerator.py 199.9.14.201 found 1 servers b'b2-lax' statistics total dns queries : 1 timeouts : 0 percent failed queries : 0.00 warnings none $ python3 nsidenumerator.py 2001:500:200::b found 1 servers b'b2-mia' statistics total dns queries : 1 timeouts : 0 percent failed queries : 0.00 warnings none
