 URL : "https://github.com/LightningAir/wacky-webapp/issues/35" TITLE : user roles and sessions BODY : a menu dropdown to switch between user roles, as with labs 5-6. we do not need authentication for this for now. add simple authentication if desired. add the current user role selection/display to the navbar, like we did in lab. we will also need sessions enabled, to store our data transfer buffers for maintenance and for flight booking data. store user role as well. use file-based sessions, and configure to use /tmp as the writeable folder. we may have to create this on our system, and we will need to ensure that its permissions are appropriate.
