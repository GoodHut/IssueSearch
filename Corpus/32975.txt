 URL : "https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/issues/41" TITLE : 1.9 lift code freeze BODY : i propose that we lift code freeze on wed, dec 13. we expect all the current prs in the milestone https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pulls?utf8=%e2%9c%93&q=is%3apr%20is%3aopen%20milestone%3av1.9%20sort%3aupdated-asc%20 to merge before then. this will involve undoing the submit queue config from https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/issues/32. however, we will maintain the milestone bot config in freeze mode until the 1.9.0 release goes out. cc @marun @jberkus @spiffxp
