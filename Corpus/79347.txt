 URL : "https://github.com/ircdocs/modern-irc/issues/38" TITLE : serve website with https BODY : as of its future v2.3.0 version, the help window of the lounge will now be pointing to http://modern.ircdocs.horse/formatting.html colors to explain/list colors to users see https://github.com/thelounge/lounge/pull/1034 . it would be really nice if we could direct our users to an https version of this site. i realize this website is served with github pages which supports both custom domains and https but not at the same time. i am not a sales rep or anything, but i have been using netlify https://www.netlify.com/ for free for this exact purpose and https, hsts, http/2 and github integration comes for free. it's a 1-click thing like github pages, nothing to configure.
