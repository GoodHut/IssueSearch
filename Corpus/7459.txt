 URL : "https://github.com/zignd/HTML-CSS-Class-Completion/issues/52" TITLE : freezes vs code BODY : not sure what information i can provide, but i thought i'd just report it. this addon freeze vs code for me. i verified this by disabling the extension. this happens every time in at least one of my projects. i have other projects that freeze occasionally but given that nature, there's no way for me to verify this extension is the cause of those. happy to provide more information if directed.
