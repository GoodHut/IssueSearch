 URL : "https://github.com/ModDota/BugTracker/issues/109" TITLE : enable the spectate button BODY : the spectate button has been disabled for custom games since they were released. it would be handy if it were enabled and allowed you to spectate a random game of that custom game, so you could see a preview of what its all about, or for developers to be able to spectate matches of their own games to get feedback, currently the only way i can watch matches of my game is by adding people who play my game as friends first, which is a less than ideal way to watch matches of my game. ! image https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16277198/24088583/3a533ae4-0d80-11e7-8e0c-0d8341b9eb9c.png
