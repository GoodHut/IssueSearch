 URL : "https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-list/issues/48" TITLE : lists, post fixer and ot BODY : current implementation of list feature and its post fixer assumes that list feature is the only source of changes typical for list feature changing type and indent . it means that post fixer reacts only to some change types move, remove, insert, rename and does not react to attribute changes, because those are preformed only by listfeature which already fixes the model if needs be. unfortunately, i can imagine scenarios where an operation coming from other client or maybe some weird undo case changes indent/type of one or more elements. that external operation combined with a change that happened on client might lead to incorrect model state. i haven't found any bugs yet, because i haven't researched this issue yet. i don't say that something is wrong, but something certainly will be wrong.
