 URL : "https://github.com/tilltnet/egor/issues/13" TITLE : egor and dplyr BODY : currently egor objects extend tbl_df which promises to be able to take advantage of all the dplyr functionality cheaply. however, i just noticed that some of the dplyr functions drop the attributes . try r library dplyr egor32 %>% + mutate woman = sex == w %>% + class 1 tbl_df tbl data.frame so not an egor anymore and all the attributes are lost : it seems to me that keeping dplyr compatibility would probably require implementing methods for all the dyplr verbs, e.g. mutate.egor and so on. this is unfortunate because i suspect that moving away from old egonetr implementation to egor was also to have the connection to tidyverse for a low development price.
