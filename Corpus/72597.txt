BODY : peplin, thank you for your nice work it is really good work, but there is lack of examples and comments about methods. i am trying to connect to my ble device and collect data with notification event, it is like a gauge and counting some numbers about production. i have read,write,notify characteristics, and in windows uwp and android, it works great. now i have to write the app for raspberry pi, and my only choice is pygatt . please create and example code about how to get notification when data changed. at least improve your description's about the related methods.
