 URL : "https://github.com/SwipeCellKit/SwipeCellKit/issues/60" TITLE : play nice with ios 11 BODY : it would be nice if swipecellkit could work together with the similar system in ios 11. i would like to use swipecellkit as a fallback for earlier versions of ios, but right now that does not work since cells get unresponsive when a cell inherit from swipecellkit's uitableviewcell's subclass.
