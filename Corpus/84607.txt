 URL : "https://github.com/datacarpentry/workshop-template/issues/54" TITLE : deprecate this repository BODY : it's my understanding that now all workshops get their template from swcarpentry/workshop-template with a variable to set to specify whether the workshop is dc, swc or lc. therefore i suggest this repository gets deprecated.
