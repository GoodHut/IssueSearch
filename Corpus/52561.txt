 URL : "https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Mono/issues/134" TITLE : concerns about the fej BODY : while marginalizing the old state, as the fej describe: we need to fix the linearization point. 1. i do see vins fixes the linearization point around x = x0, n the prior residual part, but in the imu residual part the jacobian is getting updated around different linearization point x!=x0 , will this cause any consistency problem of the system, or i'm having some misunderstanding on the fej? thanks.
