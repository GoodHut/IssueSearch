 URL : "https://github.com/html-next/flexi/issues/138" TITLE : flexi layouts and emblem BODY : we are using emblem and would like to use flexi layouts. however, what we're seeing is the templates not rendering correctly, as it renders the emblem text directly into the layout. in this simple demo repo https://github.com/mrship/emblem-flexi-layout - which is just ember, emblem and flexi-layouts - we have a setup thus: <img width= 268 alt= layout src= https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14839/31735278-5364ffe4-b439-11e7-8f6f-b3bebec87a0a.png > what we're seeing is a literal rendering of the emblem format. = welcome-page = outlet i asked on the slack channel and @runspired suggested that this might be simple enough to fix. with the sample repo, perhaps someone could take a look and point me in the right direction, as i've not been able to get this to work as expected. thanks in advance for your time.
