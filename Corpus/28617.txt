 URL : "https://github.com/na-ka-na/ExcelCompare/issues/46" TITLE : help with git diff? BODY : hi, this tool seems very useful and i'd like to try using it with my git-managed spreadsheets. 30 gives some example config. i have the gitattributes working, but in the gitconfig, command doesn't seem to do anything - i still get the binary files differ message. using textconv works as expected. i couldn't find anything in the git documentation about this feature. any ideas what to try? i'm using git 2.13.6 on fedora. also: http://programmaticallyspeaking.com/git-diffing-excel-files.html https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20069976/setup-git-diff-for-special-file-types i haven't got this far yet, but the first link claims we need a wrapper script to pass arguments 2 and 5 to excelcompare, while the other sources don't do this. which way is it? maybe it's because that was an older version of excelcompare?
