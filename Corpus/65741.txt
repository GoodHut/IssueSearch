 URL : "https://github.com/ludumdare/ludumdare/issues/616" TITLE : landing page for events BODY : navigating to: https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare i get a spinner and nothing happens. i'd suggest either navigating to a page that actually loads something e.g. just https://ldjam.com/ , or creating a page that is relevant to the given event. i.e. shows posts in that event, games in that event, etc. another thought: there is no list of guides anywhere, this could be a place for a list of links to various guides. without knowing about it, there is no way to get to https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/hosting-guide, or https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/rules right now, afaik. the same thing happens with https://ldjam.com/events/
