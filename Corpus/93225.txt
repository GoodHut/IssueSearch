 URL : "https://github.com/markstiles/SitecoreCognitiveServices/issues/29" TITLE : add long term data storage BODY : there is a growing need to move the storage of analysis into the database instead of computed fields. this should be a bucket that stores items by the original item id name or some other identifier. should also support items that are stored in a remote dam so that it can still be useful for them.
