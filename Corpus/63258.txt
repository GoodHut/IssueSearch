 URL : "https://github.com/expressjs/express/issues/3242" TITLE : discussion: mvc example BODY : in the process of replacing jade with ejs until pug dependencies are sorted i wanted to raise the discussion on how best to structure the mvc example. right now the in the mvc example, every module contains its handler and views. i'm thinking of taking this example back to a structure like; /mvc /controllers /user.js /pet.js /main.js /etc.. /views /pet /edit.html /show.html /public /db.js /index.js i was wondering if anyone has discovered any recent express based mvc libraries we could use as a source of inspiration?
