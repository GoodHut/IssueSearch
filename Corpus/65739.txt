 URL : "https://github.com/root-project/cling/issues/183" TITLE : lambdas: wrong behavior BODY : hi, i'm playing with lambdas inside cling interpreter and there are some of wrong behaviors which i report in this issue. cling $ int i; cling $ auto lambda = i double x {return i x;}; input_line_4:2:17: error: 'i' cannot be captured because it does not have automatic storage duration auto lambda = i double x {return i x;}; ^ input_line_3:2:6: note: 'i' declared here int i; ^ i think that the variable i is not in the same scope of lambda and this is why it doesn't work. but it is a correct c++ code. now, if i use the operator = cling $ int i; cling $ auto lambda = = double x {return i x;}; cling $ lambda 3 double 0.000000 cling $ i = 2 int 2 cling $ lambda 3 double 6.000000 there is no error but it is normally a copy capture, so if i change the value of i , the second call of lambda must be unchanged.
