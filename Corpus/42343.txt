 URL : "https://github.com/Vector35/community-plugins/issues/6" TITLE : aug. 2017 submissions BODY : https://github.com/ehennenfent/binja_dynamics adds a pyqt5 frontend to binjatron, including a register viewer, traceback viewer, and live memory viewer with stack frame highlighting. https://github.com/ehennenfent/binja_arch_ref adds a simple cheat sheet report to binja based on the information available in the architecture object. https://github.com/ehennenfent/binja_sensei uses the repositorymanager api to automatically install the plugins listed above, along with binja_explain_instruction , syscaller , and annotator . <hr> one other issue: binja_explain_instruction is linked as a submodule to this repo, but is not included in plugins.json or readme.md . this means that the repository manager does not provide a means to install it.
