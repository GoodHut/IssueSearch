 URL : "https://github.com/filp/whoops/issues/508" TITLE : content negotiated whoops BODY : the application that i use whoops in contains both html and json output. it would be fantastic if i could do the following: php $whoops->pushhandler new prettypagehandler ; $whoops->pushhandler new jsonresponsehandler ; and depending on the accept header of the request either pretty page or json would be output. i imagine the most logical way to implement this would be as a negotiatedhandler that would take a list of handlers, with a method like setacceptheader $accept that would then choose the correct handler to use. would this functionality be useful to others?
