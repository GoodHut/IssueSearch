 URL : "https://github.com/PageUpPeopleOrg/microservice-bootstrap/issues/37" TITLE : bring back deployment BODY : there were a few questions about deployment enablement 1. would this bootstrap repo continuously deploy? or 2. would it enable people to set up continuous deployment? of course, option 1 encompasses the option 2. the question is, whether option 2 can be achieved without going through 1, what are the merits & demerits. i am kind of looking at serverless yaml file for example where a hell a lot of things are comments, though it enables us pretty quickly. on the other end, why not just deploy it if that is alright. no right or wrong here, i guess.
