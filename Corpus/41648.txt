 URL : "https://github.com/dotwork/stephandcarlos/issues/8" TITLE : add auto-save feature BODY : add support for auto-saving new content. my best thought on accomplishing this so far is via ajax. every so often 10 seconds maybe? , an ajax post can create or update a new post or page. one complication might be if it creates a post the default type , but then it is changed to a page.
