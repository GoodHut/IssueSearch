 URL : "https://github.com/benjaoming/pytosquatting/issues/1" TITLE : impact on pypi search BODY : unless these packages are only temporary until a hardened package manager is the python norm, could they degrade the quality of pypi search results, or is there a simple filter that could exclude pytosquats? not really a problem yet, at least not for me anyway, more just curious what your perspective on it would be. thanks for tightening security on my dependencies! ;
