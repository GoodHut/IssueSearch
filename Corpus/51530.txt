 URL : "https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/issues/414" TITLE : aria 1.1 alert example BODY : hello, using jaws 18 & ie v11/chrome v59. aria 1.1 alert example: http://www.w3.org/tr/2017/wd-wai-aria-practices-1.1-20170628/examples/alert/index.html url when the trigger alert button has been activated with the enter key the alert messaging is not read until the enter key is pressed again. the focus does not immediately redirect to the alert container after the button has been activated so the alert messaging is not read by the screen reader. i added the following code which enables jaws to immediately read the alert dialog after the trigger alert button has been activated since the alert container is focusable and a focus method has been added into the javascript. html: added a tabindex= 0 to the id=example alert container to make it focusable. <div tabindex= 0 id= example role= alert ></div> javascript: added a new line using focus method using document.getelementbyid 'example' after example.innerhtml = template; document.getelementbyid 'example' .focus ;
