 URL : "https://github.com/OpenLiveWriter/OpenLiveWriter/issues/634" TITLE : download will not install BODY : because i have been having so much trouble with the updated olw, i tried to download it again, in hopes that the glitches have been fixed. installation failed. this is getting serious. i have been having trouble today posting. i cannot backspace to move text up. thus, there is a big white space at the bottom of my post. then, when i tried to post a photo and make it right or left justified so i could add text, the publishing spot don't know what to call it looked funny. the photo extended into the border and there was no place to put text. please fix this. a great thing has been ruined.
