 URL : "https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code/issues/191" TITLE : about mortality rate BODY : in the patients table of mimic iii, each subject_id relates to one expire_flag, with 0 representing survival and 1 represents non survival , right? if so, when i link patients table containing no hadm_id or icustay_id column to labevents table containing both subject_id and hadm_id columns or chartevents table containing subject_id , hadm_id and icustay_id columns , how can i get one patient's hadm_id and icustay_id when he was dead i.e.expire_flag== 1 since a single patient had multiple admissions to the hospital or icu. another question, i want to study the prognostic value of some serum indicators in labevents table.when i filter all the subjects about 8000 that have the serum indicators tested, i found the mortality of these subjects high to 50% dividing no. of expire_flag==“1” by the total of subjects . was that reasonable or it was confounded by my misunderstanding of first question?
