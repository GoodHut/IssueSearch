 URL : "https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/12431" TITLE : ios export missing? BODY : you write everywhere that it is possible to export to ios... read this manual: http://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/learning/workflow/export/exporting_for_ios.html since there is no automatic deployer yet, unzip export_templates.tpz manually and extract godotiosxcode.zip from it. where to get this zip? and as i understand godot -> ios is not possible and i should use godot -> html5 -> ios , shouldn't i?
