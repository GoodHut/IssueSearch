 URL : "https://github.com/Minivera/FocusTreeAndEventManager/issues/12" TITLE : multiple bugs in beta_2g BODY : crashes happen when: - i try to open the focus trees for uk, poland and the five commonwealth factions, plus the generic focus tree. - i try to open some localisation files i didn't test all of them but i know it happened with the debug localisation file, which is quite ironic . - i try to edit a script or load a project i saved which means the tool just can't be used right now . i also noticed that, when trying to create a focus without writing a script i often do that when i create several foci at once it wouldn't appear in the grill. not mentioning there are still some foci whose name and/or icon won't appear although, for the name part, it could be due to localisations not placed in the right file .
