 URL : "https://github.com/DevMountain/angular-2-afternoon/issues/2" TITLE : a few things BODY : is there a live example? the live examples in the other minis and afternoon projects are very helpful. it should be mentioned at the top of the readme. in the nav header, why is there a packages link? it goes to /packages , which is not a valid route. what is the purpose of $scope.allpackages = response.data; same question in bookedctrl ? it's not used so it's confusing. i find it kind of odd to order the code steps booked, packages, locations. feels backwards in terms of flow. sometimes code needs to be written backward compared to flow for the user, but this doesn't seem to be one of those cases so it's confusing to a coder to be told to do it that way. it's easier to code in the same flow i'd use the site as a user.
