 URL : "https://github.com/solid/node-solid-server/issues/574" TITLE : cli - express injection BODY : i would like to run another express middleware with the solid server while not losing the cli and its processing of args and config.json. it means i need to mount the middleware before solid mounts to it's mount path. there is an optional argument to inject express in function createserver argv, app but it is not used in cli. i'm thinking about refactoring the cli part to be a reusable module with possibility to inject both solid and express. do you have another suggestion?
