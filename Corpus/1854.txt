 URL : "https://github.com/oborel/obo-relations/issues/193" TITLE : is active in BODY : we currently have the property chain enables o occurs in -> part of this is unsafe, especially when it interacts with axiomatization of compound functions. e.g. gp-x enables 'transmembrane receptor kinase activity' has_part kinase activity occurs in intracellular => gp-x part of intracellular to solve this, we should add a new relation/qualifier: is_active_in this is a subproperty of overlaps. the textual definition should make it clear that it refers to some/any activity of a gene product.
