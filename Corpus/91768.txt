 URL : "https://github.com/cfwheels/cfwheels/issues/729" TITLE : update dependent handling BODY : this is a little messy right now, both in the code and in the docs. docs should state that for hasmany you can set dependent to remove, removeall, delete and deleteall. for hasone it should be just remove or delete since it's just one record anyway . then the code in $deletedependents can be simplified to simply call the function with the name specified. the mention of nullify here should be removed: http://docs.cfwheels.org/v2.0/docs/associations the docs for hasone and hasmany needs to be updated too.
