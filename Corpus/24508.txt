 URL : "https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/robot_upstart/issues/50" TITLE : support for fedora BODY : right now, fedora is disabled in the gbp tracks because there's no daemontools package on which it can depend. a few potential ways to eliminate the dependency: - use the native capabilities of upstart/systemd to manage user switching— may cause issues with things like creating the log path, might have to move those to install time. - use su -s instead of setuidgid , a la http://superuser.com/a/234541/48811 - bundle the tool, eg https://github.com/wertarbyte/coreutils/blob/master/src/setuidgid.c note gpl i'm not super motivated to work on this as i'm not a fedora user so the status quo is acceptable to me. but the ticket is here as a marker of work to be done if someone wants to take it up.
