 URL : "https://github.com/kit10-bot/kit10_discord_bot/issues/111" TITLE : new timeout plugin BODY : this new plugin should remove timeout functions from the users plugin, breaking them out into their own. rather than a timeout-role-to-add and a timeout-role-to-remove, instead all currently applied roles should be recorded and removed, then the timeout role added. when someone is timed back in, this process should be reversed; removing the timeout role and re-adding whatever roles they had originally.
