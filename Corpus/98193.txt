 URL : "https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/25447" TITLE : impurity in haskell builds BODY : unfortunately i wasn't able to reproduce this, but i'm guessing it has something to do with parallel builds being on... one time when building vector-algorithms i got: > properties: internal error: evacuate: strange closure type 0 > ghc version 8.0.2 for x86_64_unknown_linux > please report this as a ghc bug: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/reportabug but a subsequent build succeeded.
