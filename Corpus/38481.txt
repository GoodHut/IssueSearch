 URL : "https://github.com/hoerresb/WifiWizard/issues/116" TITLE : plugin name mismatch BODY : there's a mismatch between the name of the plugin in plugin.xml com.pylonproducts.wifiwizard and the name under which it is published on npm wifiwizard . this means that the plugin is saved to config.xml as com.pylonproducts.wifiwizard , when you install it with: cordova plugin add wifiwizard --save as a result, it fails to install when you call cordova prepare , because it can't find com.pylonproducts.wifiwizard in npm. you need to manually cahnge the entry in config.xml to wifiwizard to make it work. one of the two names should be changed so that they match. i guess it will break less people if plugin.xml is changed.
