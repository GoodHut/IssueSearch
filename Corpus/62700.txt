 URL : "https://github.com/HubSpot/humanize/issues/88" TITLE : crashes in react native BODY : i pulled this module into a react native project using npm install --save humanize-plus and all i did to start using it was: js var humanize = require 'humanize-plus' ; humanize.formatnumber 123456 ; and i got the following error: <pre> transformerror: /users/michael/gitprojects/test/node_modules/humanize-plus/dist/humanize.js: couldn't find preset es2015-riot relative to directory /users/michael/gitprojects/test/node_modules/humanize-plus </pre> i think this might be related to issue 86, because react native goes through a transpile step, so it might be finding your unnecessary .babelrc file inside the package files that has es2015-riot defined as a preset https://github.com/hubspot/humanize/blob/master/.babelrc l2 : { presets : es2015-riot } i don't think it matters for this issue, but just in case, here are my versions of react native: react-native-cli: 2.0.1 react-native: 0.39.2
