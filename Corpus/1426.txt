 URL : "https://github.com/FAC10/MPBots/issues/8" TITLE : user test 5 BODY : - hasn't heard of fb bots - thinks it's a good idea - can't find menu button easily, says it's too hidden - maybe mention the menu button in the intro - need to say explicitly that you can type any question and aren't limited to prompts - everytime you have an option screen have a 4th option 'type a question'
