 URL : "https://github.com/bschwartz10/rails_engine/issues/22" TITLE : random controller fix BODY : @bethknight1234 @bschwartz10 the code in your random controllers is the same. so instead of this: ruby def show render json: transaction.order random .first end i'd love to see something like this instead: ruby def show render json: transaction.random end we could define this on each model but that would lead to repetition. order random is specific to postgres. if we ever decided to change our database, we'd need to find all occurrences of order random and change them. if define a method called random in /app/models/application_record.rb then we would only need to update in one place.
