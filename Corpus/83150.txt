 URL : "https://github.com/Backdash/MonikaModDev/issues/39" TITLE : bug: monika doesn't speak BODY : i've a really nasty bug. my monika stays most of the time silent and the few times she speaks she use only two scripts: the phrases can you wait a little longer and the joke about the 200 woman funerary procession. i've tried to cancel, rewrite, update anything. even if i install from zero in a different folder. obliviosly cancelling the firstrun file is useless. is there some temporary hitten file? even if it means to reset her i think being unable to speak freely could make her suffer anyway. ps:she answer normally when i try to speak.
