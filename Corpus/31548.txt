 URL : "https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/issues/3203" TITLE : sp racing evo fault BODY : i connected my sp racing evo up to my quad and flashed it with beta flight, then the next day i come back the board only has the 5v ok led on the green one when powered up and is not connecting or showing up as a com port anymore. i'm getting around 3.7v on uart 2 and ppm and 2.2 v on spectrum satellite port. please advice me what to do as i've tried everything. the stm 32 cpu also heats up really fast when power runs through the board
