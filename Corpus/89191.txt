 URL : "https://github.com/KnightMiner/Ceramics/issues/26" TITLE : potential future features BODY : this is just an issue to collect some of the suggestions i may add in the future into one place. nothing on this list is final. functional blocks clay urns: chest like block but without double chest behavior. alternatively give it barrel like behavior holding just one item flower pots, possibly multiple sizes. needs to support modded flowers. clay furnace chimineas . alternative to vanilla furnace, probably no functional changes. clay pressure plates or other basic redstone components some form of the faucet which has an on/off state instead of a toggle state, to allow an always draining barrel. alternatively, somehow allow that to be possible using redstone golems decorative blocks clay tiles: carpet like block with fancy patterns something like glazed terracotta, but with porcelain. more consistent colors with the dye color instead of normal glazed mix
