 URL : "https://github.com/nstbayless/mega-engine-studio/issues/34" TITLE : water shield issues BODY : 1. if you're standing right next to an enemy and spawn the water shield, it immediately hits the enemy and stops forming. this didn't happen in mm10 - it just took out the bubbles that touched as it spawned them all. 2. the water bubbles don't 'reflect' in mm10 they popped tho properly. they just play the dink sound and then become unable to hit enemies.
