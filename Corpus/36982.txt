 URL : "https://github.com/seibaby/ff3us/issues/153" TITLE : ironic metamorph set BODY : metamorph set 4 contains all mithril equipment - except for the shield, which is the heavy shld. quoth assassin and imzogelmo: either somebody was trying to be funny, or this is tied to heavy shld's item id being just one less than mithril shld's. there are several other instances where they clearly got some nearby ids confused palette ids, dialogue ids, even item ids in events... , so this team does not get the benefit of the doubt.
