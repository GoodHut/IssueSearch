 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/cppwinrt/issues/215" TITLE : complex ui example BODY : as there isn't an integration with vs studio read xaml designer yet, could you add an example the builds a ui that is a little bit more complex, like having multiple ui elements arranged in some grid or stackpanel that also automatically stretches to the whole window. i tried to tranlate some of the uwp examples on the web, but that turned out to be all but trivial at least for an unexpiereienced user like me . e.g. most examples either only show xaml code which i can't use or c code, which apparently has access to some methods not available at cppwinrt. in both cases it is often not clear, what the equivalent cppwinrt syntax to a particular xaml / c example would be, even if the respective functions are available.
