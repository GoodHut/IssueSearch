BODY : how can i add in another emulator. i would like to be able to add in roms and emulator for atari 2600. is there an easy way to do this? or do you have to know coding / scripting in order to add another emulator to the list that is playable? atari 2600 uses .bin files which is already added to nesbox for browsers , so i just need to get the emulator added in for the games to work. i tried to see if they would work with sega emulator , but of course, it does not. lol i found an open source atari 2600 emulator, but i don't know how to implement it into the nesbox script. it's called z26 -- an atari 2600 emulator would anyone know how to do this?
