 URL : "https://github.com/Deewiant/glob/issues/10" TITLE : export pattern and token? BODY : for https://github.com/sol/hpack/issues/101 i need to decide whether a given glob pattern contains wildcards or refers to a literal file. i assume this will be possible if we expose pattern .. and token .. . i'm ok if we expose them from an internal module, if that is what you prefer. i'm also happy with any other solution that allows me to decide whether a given glob pattern contains wildcards.
