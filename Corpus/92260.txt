 URL : "https://github.com/taw/magic-preconstructed-decks/issues/2" TITLE : we need to have all decks BODY : so far mostly going through this list https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_magic:_the_gathering_theme_decks . using mostly script got 205 decks, or about half. a lot of decks 404s - wizards changed format a few times quite a few decks 500s even new decks are missing c16/c17/w16 all duel decks are missing if anyone feels like doing public service of adding c16 / c17 / w16 / duel decks to wikipedia, that would be wonderful, and i can easily import from there. there are other sources as well, but these need to be checked manually so it's more work. i'll continue semi mass import and once scripts run out of steam i list what i know to be missing. also - is there any other list of precons, or is this the best one?
