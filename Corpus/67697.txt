 URL : "https://github.com/clirdlf/hidden_collections_registry/issues/47" TITLE : public url for registry BODY : we need to be able to link to the live url in our final report to mellon. i would be fine with keeping the same url we have for the current registry. if you have other recommendations, i'm sure i'd be fine with that too. if need be, we can move it later and have it redirect. https://www.clir.org/hiddencollections/registry
