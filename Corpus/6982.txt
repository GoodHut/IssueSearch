 URL : "https://github.com/mim-Armand/TwiTool/issues/2" TITLE : cors in browser BODY : try to see if we can enable cors for twitter api in-browser chrome during development. note that this is solved for production and we have enabled the cors in chromium instance running the app, but twitter blocks requests from the browser as ridiculous as it is for twitter :poop: that'd be cool if we could enable it so we wouldn't need to run the whole project the electron side for the most part during development..
