 URL : "https://github.com/jofftiquez/vue-croppie/issues/8" TITLE : on change event emitters BODY : joff, the on change event emitters that are present in the original croppie are they here too? how do i listen to those? i saw you added your own event listeners but those are not the ones that are triggered when a user moves an image or zooms in and out. is this working in vue-croppie?
