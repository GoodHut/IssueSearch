 URL : "https://github.com/openhab/openhabian/issues/251" TITLE : poll: remove etckeeper BODY : hey everyone, as some might know, the program etckeeper is installed and set up on all openhabian systems. i believe that no average user is aware of that and no one really uses it. if shit hits the fan and some kind of backup is needed, the a git repo of /etc is probably not what the user is looking for. do you think we should remove the component? should we offer it as an optional component?
