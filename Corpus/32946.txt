 URL : "https://github.com/PrinceOfAmber/Cyclic/issues/249" TITLE : 1.11.2 keybind crash BODY : i and a few friends have been playing the new frontier modpack and they would constantly crash do to pressing either the h key or y key keybinds by accident from cyclic inventory movement so i searched around the controls for the keybinds that were causing it as well as looking at the logs from the launcher to see which mod's name came up. i've setup a new profile in curse with only forge version 13.20.0.2226 and the cyclic mod installed and i'll press h, y, right bracket or left bracket keys and it makes minecraft not respond so i have to exit the game by either pressing the close button or force quitting it via task manager. i'm attaching the log from the minecraft launcher. cyclic crash log.txt https://github.com/princeofamber/cyclic/files/731887/cyclic.crash.log.txt
