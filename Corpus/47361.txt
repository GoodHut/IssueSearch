 URL : "https://github.com/timtwomey/totum/issues/8" TITLE : page scroll hijacking BODY : issue - current page scroll plugins and jquery libraries don't offer the functionality we're looking for. the most popular one - scrollify - doesn't have the option of scroll jumping for a portion of the page, then leaving the remainder scroll naturally. it's all or nothing. also, scroll hijacking tests really badly, and provides a poor user experience imo . also worse on mobile. do we really want to do this? at the very least, could we restrict it just to luxury users on macbooks? after all, that's the target audience this pattern was designed for, no? at any rate, i'm going to have to custom code a solution that will enable scrolling the way we need it.
