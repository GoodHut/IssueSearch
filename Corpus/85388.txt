 URL : "https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp/issues/286" TITLE : expose conn in requestctx BODY : problem: custom conn implementations might want to expose data and methods to requesthandlers. requestctx already contains the reference to underlying net.conn, but it is kept private. example: conn that exposes getsockopt data. solution: rename requestctx.c to requestctx.conn , update all affected call sites. this is a small and very contained change. i will submit a pr if approved.
