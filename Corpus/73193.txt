 URL : "https://github.com/arenarium/battleground/issues/110" TITLE : consisten use of game_id BODY : from the discussion in https://github.com/arenarium/battleground/pull/109 > right now we have a game_type entry for each player in the registered_players.json file, and we name it like that throughout the code. however, i'd vote for naming it game_types , since it's actually a list of strings. on the other hand, the only place where the distinction between list and not list actually matters is in start.get_dynamic_players
if game_type in player game_type otherwise it can be whatever it wants. > regarding game_id being requested in more that one place: the dynamicagent class is a bit of a mishmash at the moment because it supports multiple use-cases e.g. loading code from a local path or from the database . passing id, owner, name, and game_type is redundant, a better solution must be possible. ideally, our code works and runtime checking of ids should not be needed. unit-tests should ensure it works. this should get cleaned up but probably better to do in a separate pull request.
