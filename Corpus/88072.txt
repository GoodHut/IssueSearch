 URL : "https://github.com/Great-Hill-Corporation/quickBlocks/issues/207" TITLE : mixing options at ethname BODY : some of the options at ethname are incompatible, e.g. we can not mix -c with -s or with -l/-e, this should be checked by the program to force the user to use only the suitable ones. right now you can invoke the tool passing all them at the same time and the behaviour is not clear, it is difficult to appreciate what is the option really applied. we can run this: ./ethname -a -m -v -c -s 0x17 rob or this ./ethname -a -m -v -c -e -l 0x17 rob or many other combinations, we should check this and do not allow these combinations.
