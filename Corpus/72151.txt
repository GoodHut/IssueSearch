 URL : "https://github.com/nextcloud/documentation/issues/606" TITLE : backup folders via rsync BODY : hi, i stumbled across the command in the backup slides of the adminstration manual https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/12/admin_manual/maintenance/backup.html : bash rsync -aax nextcloud/ nextcloud-dirbkp_ date + %y%m%d / according the rsync man page https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync the a alias --archive command excludes the a --acls command. so implicitly this swallows the latter, isn't it? i know you guys surely have more important stuff to do, but i thought i could mention it anyway. maybe somebody has a spare minute to correct it, or to correct me, if i was wrong. ðŸ™ˆ all the best, david
