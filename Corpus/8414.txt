 URL : "https://github.com/petre2dor/jump-to-tab-number/issues/1" TITLE : not safe enough BODY : it happens to me regularly that some of my last tabs get numbers above 9, which then results in a escalation of numbers, as new numbers are added, but non of the previous numbers are cleaned up. to prove my point: ! screenshot from 2017-02-28 08-23-16 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7458098/23395529/6a676508-fd8f-11e6-9b57-67aa6ffae433.png cause it seems to happen once a tab with a number previously less than 9 gets pushed outward, e.g. by opening a link in a new tab by ctrl + click . so say i have 8 tabs open, if i do a ctrl + click on tab 7, it shifts tab 8 to tab 9, and repeating the action moves it to number 10. this continues, and the numbers keep getting added, despite their numbers being larger than 9.
