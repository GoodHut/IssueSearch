 URL : "https://github.com/PopulateTools/gobierto/issues/1240" TITLE : url for docs BODY : @furilo commented on thu dec 07 2017 https://github.com/populatetools/issues/issues/184 for getafe we won't make it, but maybe it makes sense to have a kind of wrapper for the absolute url for a doc. when we list the absolute url, we wouldn't show the actual path ie. https://gobierto-populate-production.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/site-14/attachments/attachment-f017a860-1ce4-4f16-bacb-a67e64d31f59/presupuesto_completo_12_0_9899_1.pdf but something like: https://gobiernoabierto.getafe.es/docs/329 or a more obscure identifier if want to avoid easy scrapping now, this would just be a redir to the original path. it would avoid having full paths in a page, which is ugly. also, it may solve https://github.com/populatetools/gobierto/issues/733 in the future, this would allow us things like: - a counter for downloads - a viewer for docs, where we can add ui to see previous versions if/when we have that - tools to fav a doc, or track it - and the most important thing: changing a doc location also related with https://github.com/populatetools/gobierto/issues/733 all without worriyng about changing anything
