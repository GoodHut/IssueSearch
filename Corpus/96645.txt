 URL : "https://github.com/JustBoorish/BooBuilds/issues/2" TITLE : feature button for outfits BODY : an optional button to open the outfits menu instead of using shift+left click would be great, shift isn't used for anything in the game afaik and as such it is not a key that i have assigned in my gaming keyboard. it is also very bothersome because it's not something i use often enough to develop muscle memory for it, but i use it enough to be annoying not being to change outfits quickly. thank you for your time and this magnificent mod.
