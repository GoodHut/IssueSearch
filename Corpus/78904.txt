 URL : "https://github.com/ayojs/ayo/issues/57" TITLE : rename the master branch BODY : i find the name of the master branch offensive. in many parts of the world the word master has racial meaning, especially in north america where relatively recently slavery was a thing. i propose to change it to a more welcoming and inclusive word. maybe trunk ?
