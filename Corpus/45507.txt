 URL : "https://github.com/IxLahiji/CMPT371Team3/issues/69" TITLE : images stuck on hands BODY : during user testing, users would occasionally be unable to release an image from their grip. we believe this is likely due to grabbing two images at once with the same hand. there are a few ways we can go about fixing this since they stem from the issue of copies instantiating in the same spot.
