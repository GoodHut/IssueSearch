 URL : "https://github.com/OpenBazaar/openbazaar-desktop/issues/578" TITLE : old version warnings BODY : - when a user is on an older version of the server, and they try to buy click the buy button to call the order api a listing that is on an incompatible newer version, they will receive an error from the server. a modal should be shown with the error, and a call to action to upgrade their server. if they are using the bundled app, it would be ideal for a button to be shown that would run the upgrade for them it's assumed they refused an earlier upgrade when notified of it. - when a user attempts to buy a listing that is on a server whose version number is depreciated it is old enough we no longer maintain backwards compatibility with purchasing from it , they will receive an error from the server. a modal should be shown with a human-readable explanation of why this listing cannot be purchased. - if a user of the bundled app has refused an update, until they apply that update they should have some kind of nag notification. this may be a persistent flag somewhere in the app, or a modal that pops up on startup. the nag element should give them a way to apply the update. @morebrownies we'll need designs for these.
