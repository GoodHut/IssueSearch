 URL : "https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider/issues/106" TITLE : kickoff the example app BODY : i am taking a stab at learning how the example app works, but i am having a hard time getting going. i have noticed several routes available, but i do not think i am providing the correct parameters to make it to the login page. i checked so, but i was not able to pull up much help there. i do successfully see the server configuration @ http://localhost:3000/.well-known/openid-configuration. the /interaction/:grant route appears to take a grant type. i have called this route with authorization_code because i found that to be a supposed grant type in the configuration on line 28 of example/index.js but it fails with oops something went wrong . i also included the client_id parameter set to the client_id in the configuration. anybody got a url i can sling at this guy to get the login page logic starting on line 74 of example/index.js to render? thx.
