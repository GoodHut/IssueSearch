 URL : "https://github.com/tobixen/calendar-cli/issues/31" TITLE : time stamp in events BODY : hi, i recently installed calendar-cli and it looks promising! however, display calendar agendas from nextcloud server shows the wrong event time, e.g. the event is scheduled for 10:00 o'clock in nextcloud, calendar-cli shows 8:00 o'clock. setting the timezone in config file to timezone : europe/berlin does not work. any suggestions? thanks, sven
