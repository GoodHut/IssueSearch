 URL : "https://github.com/connormanning/entwine/issues/36" TITLE : error during build BODY : connor, your documentation seems to imply that it's possible to add lidar files to already indexed data. so for example i run entwine on 'a.laz' into folder 'mydata'. once that's finished i run entwine on 'b.laz' also into folder 'mydata', and entwine quickly comes back with this error: sudo docker run -it -v //media/lidar-share/:/data connormanning/entwine build -i /data/b.laz -o /data/mydata terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::out_of_range' what : vector<bool>::_m_range_check: __n which is 1 >= this->size which is 1 got error 11 terminate called recursively i have been experimenting with entwine solidly for a couple of weeks. i'm aware that i can process these files together with a single command but here i'm specifically testing the ability to add to an existing index . i've also tried specifying a 'bounds' that encompasses both files while processing 'a.laz', with the same result. both laz files are in epsg:3857, and are geographically close to one another but perhaps 30 miles apart . any idea what i'm doing wrong? thank you in advance.
