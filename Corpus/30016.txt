 URL : "https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/1706" TITLE : nix-build --hash ui BODY : first of all, i love nix-build --hash ! but i think it could be better â€” my main gripe is that it writes a message that's not trivially machine-parsable to stderr. it would be awesome if i could just pipe it into xsel or similar to make my nix-expression-writing quicker and more painless. i don't know what exactly would be the best behaviour for this, however. what do people think of the idea of changing it so that nix-build does not print the output path to stdout, instead printing only the hash? perhaps a better long-term solution is the already planned according to @edolstra's talk at nixcon inclusion of --json flags for all commands, and having build/realise commands include the hash as appropriate so it would look like nix build foo.src --json | jq .sha256 . but in the meantime, i personally would like if nix-build --hash printed only the hash to stdout.
