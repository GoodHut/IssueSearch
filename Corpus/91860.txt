 URL : "https://github.com/seedco/Workshop/issues/13" TITLE : update/edit personal info BODY : what allow customers to edit their personal email, phone number or address without having to contact support. description make certain personal info fields editable in the app, so that a customer doesn't have to contact the support team to change non-business related information. if necessary, support can validate address updates on the backend and then confirm in a support message when the address has been updated. but the form to do so could be available in the app and not have to generate a support message or phone call. user story as a business owner, i may need to update my personal info from time to time even though my business info associated with the account doesn't change. i don't want to have to contact support to update my personal email, i'd rather just be able to update the information in the app. as a support agent, i don't want to constantly have to stop what i'm doing to validate an address change for a customer's personal info or have to edit a persons email or phone number if it doesn't need to be validated. i'd rather work through a list of address updates and validate them all at once.
