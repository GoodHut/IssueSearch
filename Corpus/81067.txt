 URL : "https://github.com/civetweb/civetweb/issues/385" TITLE : version 1.9 and libressl BODY : version 1.8 of civetweb compiles cleanly with 'no_ssl_dl' flag set against libressl 2.3.5. version 1.9 doesn't compile cleanly against libressl 2.3.5 or libressl 2.4.4. the warning on windows using vs2015 is: build/src/civetweb.c 11864 : warning c4013: 'asn1_digest' undefined; assuming extern returning int searching libressl doesn't produce any reference to such a function, the closest match being 'asn1_item_digest'. searching the latest openssl code does still find such a function, but it is enclosed in ' ifndef no_asn1_old', suggesting that it is likely to be removed at some point in the future. is the inability to compile against libressl intentional or an unforeseen consequence?
