 URL : "https://github.com/vuematerial/vue-material/issues/834" TITLE : v-html in md-icon BODY : https://github.com/vuematerial/vue-material/blob/b992c27a3b6407ae2fc836345dc91bcd32c1f379/src/components/mdicon/mdicon.vue l2 would it be more prudent to use the {{ }} mustache notation to interpolate the string value of the icon rather than v-html? i was just reading this article on xss https://blog.sqreen.io/xss-in-vue-js/?utm_campaign=revue%20newsletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=revue and i'm not too familiar with this attack vector but the only component that uses v-html in a way that the user isn't specifically asking for raw html interpolation is the icon component.
