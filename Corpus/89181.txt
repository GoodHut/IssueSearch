 URL : "https://github.com/pojome/elementor/issues/1764" TITLE : post issue with read more BODY : if a query is made it will give you the appropriate posts. on this page you have a read more that works with the permalink. everything works fine. except with the following example. if a query is made it will give you the appropriate posts. if those post include a query as well even if it is not visible on your query the elementor builder will give you the permalink on the read more text. when you save the page it will result in a non functional read more with the parent page as link. so you will stay on the same page.
