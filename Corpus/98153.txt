 URL : "https://github.com/der-stefan/OpenTopoMap/issues/103" TITLE : improve rendering of trees BODY : suggestion from jo cassel in the german forum https://forum.openstreetmap.org/viewtopic.php?pid=646605 p646605 - now we render natural=tree + denotation=landmark. we should also show trees with denotation=natural_monument. - the decision broadleaf_tree.png or conifer_tree.png is made by the type=conifer. this key is outdated, we should use leaf_type=... because leaf_type is not in the osm2pgsql style we may do it after the next import.
