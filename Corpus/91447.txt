 URL : "https://github.com/pipliz/ColonySurvival/issues/24" TITLE : torches. they don't work. BODY : windows 10, new laptop, not very powerful. singleplayer, don't know about singleplayer. torches a don't produce light b don't have a physical body. it's like a hollow torche model. if you break a block under it, it doest't go away, but continues to float, and where is no way to destroy it. c you can place an infinite amout of these bugged torches, no matter how many you have in the inventory. they just won't end. restarting the game made all of the broken torches go away and fixed the problem. p.s luv your game <3 output_log.txt https://github.com/pipliz/colonysurvival/files/1154044/output_log.txt
