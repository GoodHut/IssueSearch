 URL : "https://github.com/bitcoinjs/coinselect/issues/23" TITLE : layer for confirmations BODY : i am thinking about adding another layer for coin selection, but i am not sure if to take it here or to a separate library. some inputs are confirmed and some are unconfirmed; some are from user himself and some are from other people. in coin selection, you first want to try only the confirmed inputs with 6+ confs, except for your own inputs that you can spend with 1+ conf, and only then use unconfirmed; except for coinbase inputs, that need to be confirmed with 50+ confs i think . however, right now, inputs in coinselect don't have information about that, and doesn't take that into account. do you think it should be here, or in another library?
