 URL : "https://github.com/SalomonBrys/Kodein/issues/73" TITLE : injection via delegate BODY : i think that a really nice thing that can be done in kotlin when it comes to dependency injection is that dependencies can be injected with delegates. i made a small thing that works like this, and essentially, this is what it would look like kotlin fun main args: array<string> { injekt.configure { bind<datasource> to { // get a data source here. } } } // otherfile.kt class otherfile { val ds: datasource by inject } the syntax doesn't have to be exactly like that, but i feel like something similar to that, where you can get dependencies with a delegate instead of passing a singular kodein instance to every class would be nice.
