 URL : "https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/7316" TITLE : dgels is missing BODY : dgels doesn't seem to be exposed in sp.linalg.lapack . would it make sense to expose it? also it could be added as a driver to lstsq . all the current drivers are svd based, so it would be nice to have a method based on the qr decomposition. it should be a bit faster too. i can work on a pr if this sounds reasonable.
