 URL : "https://github.com/gaberchen/localVelocityForce/issues/2" TITLE : fails in parallel BODY : after taking a quick look over the code, i suspect there are some unneeded reduce operations, e.g., https://github.com/gaberchen/localvelocityforce/blob/master/localvelocityforce/localvelocityforce.c l224 if i remember correctly, cells_ only contains the cells on that particular processor, so summing up that field doesn't make much sense, since the source term only needs to be added to the cells on each processor. a reduce operation would only be necessary if you had to share data, e.g., to write out some mean value over the entire cellset .
