i found this video - it includes a new player tutorial in the old haven area. media=youtube lqglvnmspsw /media new players start south of the island - in the old dock area as opposed to the current version of servuo - where the game starts near the bank in new haven tutorial is active in old haven - runs from the docks through the interior of old haven, to the gates of new haven.
i also noticed that in the current version of servuo - inside the ruins of little shop of magic - there are two red gates - which have no destination target both do not work for teleport purposes . reported by: lordfenris report thread: http://servuo.com/threads/lack-of-new-haven-tutorial.8341/
