 URL : "https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/issues/4442" TITLE : power transformer preset BODY : hi, an extension proposal had been accepted regarding power transformer mapping. any preset involving power transformer and power pole with transformer should be updated. ​https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/proposed_features/transformer_extension_proposal tagging of power=transformer has been updated accordingly ​https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/tag:power%3dtransformer tagging user should be prompted for the following tags with according label , out of casual ones : - transformer= {distribution, generator, converter, traction, auto, phase_angle_regulator, auxiliary, yes} function of transformer - location= transformer location - phases= number of phases - frequency= operating frequency - voltage:primary= primary power plant side voltage - voltage:secondary= secondary consumer side voltage - voltage:tertiary= tertiary auxiliary side voltage - windings= number of windings - windings:configuration = {star, delta, open-delta, zigzag, open, scott, leblanc} windings configuration - rating= rating in va - devices= number of different transformer devices voltage= key shouldn't be used any more on power transformers. additionally, some validation rules should be created as follow and warn users : check rating= is given in va and without any unit in the value like multiples kva, mva,... check voltage= isn't associated with power=transformer or transformer key thank you in advance to take care of this, all the best.
