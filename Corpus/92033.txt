 URL : "https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/3403" TITLE : user customizable toolbar BODY : change the swing ui toolbar so that it is fully customizable by the user. users should be able to specify whichever of the supported controls they want on the toolbar and where they want them. hopefully the core and add-ons will still be able to register controls in exactly the same way as now, but the toolbar layout will be controlled by code driven off configs defined by the user. drag and drop would be ideal but other simpler to implement options are also acceptable.
