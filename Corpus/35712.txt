 URL : "https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/issues/609" TITLE : export file location BODY : the export commands seem to save the file to whichever directory neo4j was started from. so if i restart neo4j from a particular directory: /home/szarnyasg/asdf $ ~/neo4j/bin/neo4j restart and export a file like this: call apoc.export.cypher.all 'my.cypher', {} yield file, source, format, nodes, properties, time, rows, relationships as rels return it will end up in that directory. /home/szarnyasg/asdf $ ll my.cypher -rw-r--r-- 1 szarnyasg szarnyasg 7037 sep 26 18:27 my.cypher this took me some time to figure out. is this intentional? or maybe this should be clarified in the docs? if so, i'm happy to submit a pr.
