 URL : "https://github.com/IzunaDevs/nsfw_dl/issues/3" TITLE : finish command line. BODY : currently the command line was started, but is not complete in __main__.py . this needs to be completed. i am thinking with an command line prefix similar to pip's. not sure on what to use to process the options. i guess there are a few modules that can probably do the same exact thing. ðŸ¤” also on top of that i know there must be an --download option that can download the response to an file. not sure about some sort of auto file name based upon the file names on the url's like maybe basename the urls to extract the file name from the url? .
