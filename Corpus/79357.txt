 URL : "https://github.com/ros-perception/slam_gmapping/issues/45" TITLE : service for map metadata BODY : problem at the moment it is possible to use the /map topic for map data, just like the /dynamic_map service can be used to get the current map using a service. the /map_metadata topic can be used to get the map metadata. however, there is no service which returns the same data. using the topic requires subscribing, waiting for data and then unsubscribing again. use case this is useful in some nodes which depend on gmapping and require the map dimensions but not the content of the map. solution create a service maybe /dynamic_map_metadata which allows requesting the current map metadata.
