 URL : "https://github.com/spatie/schema-org/issues/17" TITLE : recipe properties missing BODY : the current schema.org documentation on https://schema.org/recipe says that recipe should have properties like _preptime_, _recipeingredient_, _recipeinstructions_, _recipeyield_ and so on. they currently aren't generated in recipe.php https://github.com/spatie/schema-org/blob/master/src/recipe.php . the source https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/sdo-callisto/data/schema.rdfa does hold some information about these fields though: html <div typeof= rdf:property resource= http://schema.org/recipeyield > <span class= h property= rdfs:label >recipeyield</span> <span property= rdfs:comment >the quantity produced by the recipe for example, number of people served, number of servings, etc .</span> <span>domain: <a property= http://schema.org/domainincludes href= http://schema.org/recipe > recipe</a></span> <span>range: <a property= http://schema.org/rangeincludes href= http://schema.org/text > text </a></span> </div>
