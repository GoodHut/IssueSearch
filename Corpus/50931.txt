 URL : "https://github.com/PolymerElements/paper-input/issues/548" TITLE : add flags for patterns BODY : it's not possible to provide flags for the regexp constructor used by iron-input's allowed-pattern and maybe pattern, too . i. e. providing hello as validation pattern flags hello as invalid. would be great if attributes allowed-pattern-flags and pattern-flags were introduced, to make the regexp case-insensitive.
