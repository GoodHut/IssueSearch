 URL : "https://github.com/libAtoms/QUIP/issues/42" TITLE : string_cat_real crashing BODY : this has occurred when a very large real was passed to the concatenation operator. 1 i guess the return value is too long and some kind of corruption happens. annoying because i can't run the quip program on my mac 1 e.g. in src/libatoms/connection.f95 line 1073, my_max_pos_change = huge 1.0_dp in some cases. even though this line is not even printed at normal verbosity levels, the string is still created and crashes.
