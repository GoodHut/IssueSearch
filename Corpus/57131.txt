 URL : "https://github.com/nskrypnik/kivy-rotation3d/issues/1" TITLE : please provide license BODY : i based some obj loading and display code partly on kivy-rotation3d. also, if you want a more fault-tolerant and spec-oriented obj loader, you can try out my project: <https://github.com/expertmm/kivyglops>. if you provide a license that will help me make sure my licensing is accurate. i suggest mit license since that is the kivy license. my project is gpl v3.0 so far.
