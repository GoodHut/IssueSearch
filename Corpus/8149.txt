 URL : "https://github.com/sharetribe/sharetribe/issues/3103" TITLE : need seed data? BODY : _please add only one problem per issue. if you are facing multiple problems, add multiple issues._ sharetribe version: master ee474fe environment: heroku server mode: production description: when i first installed everything, i was prompted to create a user and a community, which worked. inside the community, i wanted to setup stripe for payments, but i didn't have an option in the left admin nav menu for payments . i poke around the code enough to realize it seemed to need a record in the payment_settings table referencing stripe , so i added that and then payment showed up all of a sudden. this doesn't feel right, so is there some seed data i'm missing which would allow me not to have to create these records by hand? also, i'm looking to enable availability. and like above, i dove around the code enough to realize there's a record in the transaction_processes table with an attribute of process set to none . if i change that to preauthorize , i get the option to edit the availability in the shape. this, too, doesn't feel right by editing these records manually. am i missing something by not being able to do this from the ui?
