 URL : "https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-hooks-common/issues/131" TITLE : create a $search hook BODY : this might be a bit tricky because we might need the user to specify the db or to inspect the service type in order to determine the format but a hook can totally be registered at the app level to enable search capability for a service. here is a quick first stab: js // called like this // const query = { // $search: { name: 'foo' } // } function hook { if hook.params.query && hook.params.query.$search { const $search = hook.params.query.$search; const keys = object.keys $search ; if keys.length { const key = keys 0 ; const searchterm = $search key ; hook.params.query key = { $regex: ${searchterm} , $options: 'si' }; } delete hook.params.query.$search; } }; caveats for above example: - this only works for one property currently. it should be expanded to support multiple - this is for mongodb/mongoose. it should be expanded for more dbs.
