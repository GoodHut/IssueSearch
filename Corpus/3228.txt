 URL : "https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs/issues/96" TITLE : menu bar item BODY : treemacs ought to have a menu bar item for those of us who haven't memorized all the key bindings. at the moment, the only solution for getting a key binding that i can't remember requires something like c-h b . this makes things difficult since you have to hunt around to find what you need. it would be much nicer to have a menu bar item. if you'd like a simple reference implementation, you could check out paredit-menu. https://github.com/phillord/paredit-menu/blob/master/paredit-menu.el
