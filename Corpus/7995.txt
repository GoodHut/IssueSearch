 URL : "https://github.com/mariusmuja/flann/issues/321" TITLE : lsh query speed BODY : my lshindex is built with a table contains about 40000 points, each point is of about 100 dimensions, the lshindex is built with default configuration, i.e.,12 tables, key size of 20, one point per each query, on my computer with intel core i5 cpu, debug mode, each query cost about 200milliseconds, i wonder if it is possible for speed up by optimizing the configuration? or reduce the number of points?
