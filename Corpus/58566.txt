 URL : "https://github.com/tjvr/moo/issues/59" TITLE : sort literals globally BODY : currently, literals in earlier rules will take precedence over later rules, even if they're a prefix. test 'prioritises literals correctly', => { let lexer = moo.compile { one: 'moo', two: 'moomintroll', } lexer.reset 'moomintroll' expect lexer.next .tomatchobject {type: 'two'} // fails } this is probably not what we want. we're already special-casing literals; it might not unreasonable to special-case 'em further? then again, magic is bad. argh.
