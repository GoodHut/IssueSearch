 URL : "https://github.com/DSpace/dspace-angular/issues/83" TITLE : upgrade to angular 4 BODY : angular 4 has been released. a little background info: angular 3 never existed, and the step from angular 2 to 4 is a lot smaller than the step from 1 to 2 was. it's comparable dspace 3 in that regard. you can find the reasoning behind the change here http://angularjs.blogspot.be/2016/12/ok-let-me-explain-its-going-to-be.html this blogpost http://angularjs.blogspot.be/2017/03/angular-400-now-available.html gives an overview of what's new, and how to migrate. in our case migration won't be quite as simple as it is explained in that blogpost, because of universal. angular universal used to be a separate project, but is included in angular 4 now, so our dependencies and likely also a lot of the universal specific files server.ts, node.module.ts, browser.module.ts, â€¦ will need to change. universal starter, the boilerplate project we started from, has an open issue to migrate to 4: https://github.com/angular/universal-starter/issues/376
