 URL : "https://github.com/darktrojan/openwith/issues/166" TITLE : hide context menu BODY : please add an option to hide/disable the page and tab right-click context menus. the pop-up menu from addon icon on the main toolbar is enough. the firefox 57 context menu is already filled with many useless items and the customization addons like menuwizard work no more . while some users can hide some default firefox context-menu items like make screenshot or send to pocket using userchrome.css , i have no idea how to hide the items, added by addons because i don't know the corresponding some addons have the corresponding option not to show the context menu , for example: ublock, save page we, fvd speeddial. but open with does not.
