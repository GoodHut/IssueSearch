 URL : "https://github.com/WaniKani/WanaKana/issues/53" TITLE : release on npm BODY : the latests version on npm is the 1.3.7 while it seems the latest version here is the 1.3.11. would you mind to release the latest version in npm please? it should be as easy as: cd project_folder npm publish thank you! ps, i'm using unpkg.com so the site breaks with the last module.exports , which doesn't appear on the current release: https://unpkg.com/wanakana@1.3.7/lib/wanakana.js
