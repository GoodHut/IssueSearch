 URL : "https://github.com/StratusNetwork/Map-Rotations/issues/55" TITLE : ctw uchiura BODY : yousoro~ welcome to my second map, and my first attempt at an objective map, uchiura. this map is inspired by the setting of _love live! sunshine!!_, which is based off of the real life numazu, shizouka prefecture, japan. many of the structures of the map are based off of locations from the anime. my goal for this map was to give it a more natural shape to it, rather than the well-defined shapes seen in most ctw maps although i had to sacrifice this goal somewhat in order to make the map less rushable . for the wool locations, i went with a design similar to connected, where the opposing team's wool rooms are on the same piece of land, although with the area connecting them being inaccessible. i did this to allow players to see their team's wool rooms clearly from right outside of spawn, seeing as the wool rooms would be much less visible if they were directly to the side of spawn. ! 2017-04-20_14 03 45 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/26776253/25250469/b6586b34-25e3-11e7-8536-e533808a4972.png team size: 24v24 teams: pink vs light blue album: http://imgur.com/a/g4gab xml: https://pastebin.com/d4t6vbnk may need checking due to my lack of experience, despite having help and my best efforts download: private
