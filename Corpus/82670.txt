 URL : "https://github.com/kekeh/mydatepicker/issues/476" TITLE : angular 5 aot build issue BODY : i know you say it is compatible only with angular 2 and 4. what about angular 5? are you planning to support it sometime soon? i got the following error while compiling with webpack after ngc: _error in ./aot/node_modules/mydatepicker/dist/my-date-picker.component.ngfactory.js module not found: error: can't resolve './directives/my-date-picker.focus.directive' in '.\aot ode_modules\mydatepicker\dist' @ ./aot/node_modules/mydatepicker/dist/my-date-picker.component.ngfactory.js 4:0-66_ it seems that the problem is, that ngc had't created the './directives/my-date-picker.focus.directive.ngfactory.js' file. in the './directives' directory, there are generated only 'my-date-picker.focus.directive.ngfactory.js.map' and 'my-date-picker.focus.directive.ngsummary.json'. i have angular version 5.0.3 and webpack 3.8.1.
