 URL : "https://github.com/quailiff/emojistats/issues/12" TITLE : tracking custom emojis BODY : i'm close to the 50 emoji limit on my server and my main goal when i tried this bot, was to get some stats on which custom emoji is the more used & decide which one i keep. dunno if it's already possible but i need to host the bot or something like that. i just guessed i could make a comment here :>.
