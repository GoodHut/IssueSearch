 URL : "https://github.com/webjars/webjars/issues/1598" TITLE : results are not sorted BODY : minor inconvenience, but search results are not sorted. i searched for @material to update a bunch of packages in that namespace, and they came in random order. it would be nice to have them sorted alphabetically.
