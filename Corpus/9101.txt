 URL : "https://github.com/adminspotter/cuddly-gl/issues/10" TITLE : test ui objects BODY : i'm not sure how we should go about this. things like the rect and the active we can test without a gl head, but we do need gl for the rest of them. we might be able to repurpose the existing uitest program, cram everything possible into it, and render it onto a framebuffer device via mesa? we'll miss some of the interaction aspects; there may be some sort of x11 testing framework that can do automatic mouse movement and keyboard interaction. for this particular issue, we'll get the testing methodology and whatever framework we need in place. the individual pieces can have separate issues for their own tests. https://metacpan.org/pod/x11::guitest may be worth looking into. copied from adminispotter/r9 148
