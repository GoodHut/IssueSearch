 URL : "https://github.com/gabrielkrell/finsta/issues/9" TITLE : add static/images folder BODY : since this doesn't have any files in it, it doesn't get tracked by git. the easiest way to make sure it's picked up without loading anything strange in finsta or adding special logic is by adding a default image. this is required to make our permissions work in 7 https://github.com/gabrielkrell/finsta-client-setup/issues/7 of finsta-client-setup. users shouldn't have the ability to create folders under /static probably , so they can't do this themselves.
