 URL : "https://github.com/participedia/frontend/issues/591" TITLE : eliminate react warnings BODY : in the console there are a number of warnings coming from react. while they do not appear to be causing problems now, some of them could in the future there is a reason it is warning us, after all , and in the immediate they are hugely distracting and make it harder to debug real issues. some are warning about using deprecated features of react, which i'm less worried about although we should address those soon too , but things like: failed prop type: the prop isauthenticated is marked as required in layout , but its value is undefined . warning: failed prop type: the prop profile is marked as required in layout , but its value is undefined . 'type' is assigned a value but never used no-unused-vars 'geosuggest' is defined but never used no-unused-vars 'searchlink' is defined but never used no-unused-vars no choice data for property: economic development, returning sample data should all be fixed asap
