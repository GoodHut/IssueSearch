 URL : "https://github.com/csed2018/messengerBot/issues/7" TITLE : csed'18 bot feedback BODY : 1 the table as written statements doesn't seem so good ,to me as a viewer. i don't know how applicable the idea is, but i got one, maybe you can preview the table as a real table. i mean, an image with rows and columns. 2 also in the description the menu the 3-caret icon on the left of the composer , i didn't find such thing in that menu, if you meant what i understood maybe it's my problem . 3 the help description is not, somehow, user-friendly. maybe you can expose your idea more with symbols or icons. 4 i am not an english expert :d but i think there are some grammar mistakes. 5 maybe you should write less texts and make the interaction more with symbols and icons, cause sometimes reading long statements and paragraphs is boring. and sorry for being boring, myself :3
