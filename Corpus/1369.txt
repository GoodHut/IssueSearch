 URL : "https://github.com/chrmarti/testissues/issues/2245" TITLE : sync rebase BODY : i suggest having a sync rebase option under sync . most of the times i find myself having to manually run the two commands simply because sync uses regular pull. i don't want to edit my git configuration to always rebase either. i think it makes sense to have a sync rebase option since there already is a pull rebase , and sync uses pull.
