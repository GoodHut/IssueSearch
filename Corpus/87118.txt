 URL : "https://github.com/foundersandcoders/a-pattern-language/issues/10" TITLE : is a separate repo useful BODY : @bradreeder i'm slowly wondering whether this separation is helpful? wouldn't it be better to have everything linkable within the same repo? this repo doesn't mean much without master-reference , right? and the master-reference vision doesn't mean much without these patterns. i'm thinking we should just have a meta label for issues like 9 and have them live in master-reference .
