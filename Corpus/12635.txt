 URL : "https://github.com/SWS-Methodology/faoswsTrade/issues/140" TITLE : raw data reports BODY : we need reports on raw data. the suggested tables are quoting team b/c .doc : - table1 : country list by year of which reporters are contained in the file: a table such as this would allow us to quickly identify data gaps and facilitate comparisons. if we are only adding on year at a time, then obviously this table would only contain one column, but it would be helpful to compare it to previous years. - table 2 : list of non-reporting countries: same general format as above, but contains the complementary list of countries not reporting for those years similar to your table 8 - table 3 : number of records, by reporter this is very similar to your table 7 - table 4 : import/export content check: for every reporter for the year in question, a check that the file contains both import data and export data as well as re-exports and re-imports . each year would have its own table. - table 5 : for each reporter, a comparison of the number of records, compared to the previous year. - table 6 : check that quantities and values are included, current year - table 7 : report of records with missing quantities, for each year - table 8 : listing of countries by year , for which data has been revised - table 9 : list of unmapped codes, by country, by year @malexan @vidigal88 let's update this issue by indicating when the tables are generated/stored.
