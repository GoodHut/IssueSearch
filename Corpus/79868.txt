 URL : "https://github.com/vue-play/vue-play/issues/70" TITLE : suggestion: add examples BODY : getplay seems ok, but i don't like so much that philosophy. i would like to always be able to set it up all by my self. the documentation doesn't seems helping much with that case, and the most effective way would be a example folder with a mini project set up. thanks!
