 URL : "https://github.com/LI3DS/pg_li3ds/issues/9" TITLE : sensor.root semantics ? BODY : the notion of the sensor.root is not clear : any node could be the root of a transfo tree referencing it... what is needed from my perspective is the ability to get, given a sensor, its default referential for new datasets when a datasource is created to fill in its referential field . a possibility would be to rename root as something more explicit that this means it is the default referential for creating datasources from this referential's sensor. another would be to move this to the sensor, having there a reference to its default referential with the issue of a circular foreign key referencing between sensors and referentials .
