 URL : "https://github.com/ignasbernotas/dexie-relationships/issues/26" TITLE : does not work with webpack BODY : i'm using typescript with webpack, and when instantiating dexie, the export that's used is relationships.default . ts import dexie from 'dexie'; import relationships from 'dexie-relationships' export class appdatabase extends dexie { constructor { super 'appdatabase', {addons: relationships } ; } } after compilation and packing, {addons: relationships } turns into {addons: relationships.default } . is this an error with the module, or an export?
