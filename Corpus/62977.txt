 URL : "https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/cryptpad_ynh/issues/8" TITLE : customize look and feel BODY : once installed, this app looks like the original https://www.cryptpad.fr website, which is very confusing. but it provides a supported way to customize the look and feel which is detailed here https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/blob/master/customize.dist/readme.md , and that could be used to get a neutral yunohost look and feel.
