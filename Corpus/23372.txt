 URL : "https://github.com/rendro/easy-pie-chart/issues/197" TITLE : paypal auto update BODY : i know html/css, but just haven't been able to get a grip on js/php - i've read'n'read but still can't figure it out. so any help on this would be much appreciated. i've successfully implemented this pie chart, but i'm having to manually calculate & enter in the percentage number daily. am trying to figure out a way to have this happen automatically. so, would like to enter a monthly goal in the script somewhere, then have the pie chart reflect the percentage of how much has been donated toward that goal - then reset to zero the first of each month. this should not use paypal's balance because the donated money is transferred to the bank account regularly/weekly/randomly. so instead, it should keep track of all the payments. to complicate it even more, some are auto-subscriptions, so the income isn't always from the website forms. additionally, i have 2 forms on the same page, one for one-time donations & the other for auto monthly donations . if it's beyond the scope of appropriate help here, could you point me in the right direction on finding open-source scripts that can do this? all the scripts that i've found that does this are wordpress plugins, but i'm not using wordpress. thanks for your time.
