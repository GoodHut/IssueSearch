 URL : "https://github.com/joshdholtz/fastlane-plugin-s3/issues/40" TITLE : override filename in s3 BODY : hi, i have a specific need to upload the ipa to s3 multiple times and with different name. i thought it would be nice to add another parameter to the action: file_name which will override the default ipa param that is currently also being used for the uploaded file_name . i can think of scenarios where this could be relevant for other people as well. if you're with me on this, i could make a pr for this feature, if not, i'll develop it for local use only. let me know what you think or if you need more information regarding this feature.
