 URL : "https://github.com/dougludlow/ng2-bs3-modal/issues/196" TITLE : modal dialog didn't open BODY : hello, demo from this repository works great on my pc. however, when i use modalcomponent in different project angular-cli , modal dialog is just not opening. no exceptions are thrown. 1. .... @viewchild 'modal' validationmodal: modalcomponent; .... validationmodal object is well defined. 2. .... this.validationmodal.open ; .... enter to open method, in modal-instanse.ts .... function topromise<t> observable: observable<t> : promise<t> { return new promise resolve, reject => { observable.subscribe next => { resolve next ; } ; } ; } .... resolve next is never reached. trying to be close to this demo,i added ng2-bs3-modal as a folder in the project remove installation from node-modules . as well, i downgraded zone.js like in demo to 0.6.21. these didn't lead to the solution. any ideas why dialog didn't open? thank you in advance
