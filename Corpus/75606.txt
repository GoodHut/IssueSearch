BODY : hi - if there is more than one jpg folder/json in development, is there a way to combine/merge them such that the tagging work doesn't have to be redone on either? assuming the image file names are unique, collecting them all under the same folder wouldn't be a problem. how about merging the json files? thanks, rob
