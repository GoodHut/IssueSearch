 URL : "https://github.com/collective/collective.pwexpiry/issues/21" TITLE : plone 4.3.x compatibility BODY : filing a ticket to make sure the comment in https://github.com/collective/collective.pwexpiry/pull/19 issuecomment-349643672 does not get overlooked. if it would just be a conditional import to fix the situation i'd have created a pr @frapell as i don't want to break plone5 support by re-adding plone4 support i think it's best that you take a look on this as you merged and mostly wrote the changes.
