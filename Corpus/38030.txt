 URL : "https://github.com/DhrBaksteen/ArduinoOPL2/issues/4" TITLE : no license specified BODY : dhrbacksteen, i would like to use this library as a starting point for a project i am working on. since you don't have a license file specified, i am unsure if i can use this for my project. would you consider adding an open source license designation to this project such as the mit license? thanks for your hard work!
