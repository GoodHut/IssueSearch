 URL : "https://github.com/PlusToolkit/PlusLib/issues/306" TITLE : docs out of sync BODY : i had a branch https://github.com/dzenanz/pluslib/tree/winproberf in my repo with a lot of changes. merging https://github.com/dzenanz/pluslib/tree/wprf current master required a lot of manual conflict resolution. i am now trying to use astyle to format the resulting file, but the format given in this document https://github.com/plustoolkit/plusbuild/blob/master/docs/buildinstructionswindows.md does not seem complete: the styler adds two spaces between code and //comments , whereas there was only one space before. i looked at the options in astyle visual studio extension, and could not see an option which would affect that. am i doing something wrong, or is the documentation slightly out of date? just underneath in the same document https://github.com/plustoolkit/plusbuild/blob/master/docs/buildinstructionswindows.md , doxygencomments links to a vs extension version which only works in vs2013. is there an updated extension which does the same job, e.g. this https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemname=staughtoncoding.oneclickdocs ?
