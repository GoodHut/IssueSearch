 URL : "https://github.com/danburkert/prost/issues/14" TITLE : enumerations and camelcase BODY : i happened to notice a behavior with prost code generator, that doesn't convert enum items correctly. it seems to make the assumption the items are snake_case , converting them to camelcase . in our case, the enum values are already in camelcase , but then they are converted into broken camelcase , which is hard to read and now when converting our projects from rust-protobuf to prost, breaks lots of things. what is the expected behavior? always having proto enums in snake_case and then in rust camelcase ? allowing camelcase in proto and converting it to camelcase in rust or detecting if proto has already camelcase and converting it correctly to camelcase in rust?
