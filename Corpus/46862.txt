 URL : "https://github.com/RuedigerMoeller/kontraktor/issues/47" TITLE : native react support! BODY : you have been busy! our front end is react. we are currently using js4k from v3.33 for our interface to the back end. we started using node.js to serve the compiled react components, but switched to nginx to eliminate the use of a daemon, as used by nodejs. what are the advantages of using the native react support in 4.0?
