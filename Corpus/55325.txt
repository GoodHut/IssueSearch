 URL : "https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm/issues/226" TITLE : input passthrough hook BODY : so, when getting spacemacs up and running with exwm, i ran into a problem with hydra/transient states. to get them working properly, i'd need to either: 1. set exwm--input-line-mode-passthrough before entering a hydra state and unsetting it afterwards. unfortunately, there doesn't appear to be a good way to do this there's no global hydra-enter-hook / hydra-exit-hook . 2. modify exwm to check if a hydra is active bound-and-true-p hydra-curr-map . unfortunately, this means modifying exwm to deal with every special case like this. then i thought of a third option, a general purpose hook: elisp or exwm-input--line-mode-passthrough exwm-input--during-command run-hook-with-args-until-success 'exwm-input-line-mode-passthrough-hook event ; ... thoughts? i'm worried that running user specified code in the keyboard handler could cause weird race conditions/deadlocks.
