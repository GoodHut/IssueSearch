 URL : "https://github.com/inhyechoi/Instanews/issues/2" TITLE : semantic class names BODY : css class names are quite vague and use the actual element's name in the class i.e. .div-sizing . furthermore, in your javascript the naming of functions and variables are okay because there is only one js file. in the future though, they should be more specific so not only the evaluator, but you too can identify exactly what the main.js file is doing.
