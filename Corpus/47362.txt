 URL : "https://github.com/ryancramerdesign/AdminThemeUikit/issues/40" TITLE : page tree view tweaks BODY : maybe it's just me, but i miss the lines from the default theme - it just seems to help separate things visually - especially with the slightly thicker lines below parents when expanded. i'd also like to see the background for the row highlighted on hover. also, not a huge fan of the default color for pages. the hover color is ok, but the default is just a little weird imo. also, not sure about the yellow highlight for open items - it clashes pretty badly i think. thanks!
