 URL : "https://github.com/chromaticats/meta/issues/50" TITLE : world for custom maps BODY : make a world for building custom maps, divided into the right size plots - only staff can build there, have people build the map in plots and then move it for them this lets people make custom signs etc using maps, but in a more stable way than imageonmap, plus giving a use for pixel art and also a bigger sense of value and involvement since they made it themself
