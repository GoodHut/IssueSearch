BODY : would be great to have simple think marcos steps to check, for instance, payment request https://w3c.github.io/payment-request/ spec's pubrule conformance. that is: npm install pass in https://w3c.github.io/payment-request/ or do i need to generate it? get specberus to error in the console if non-conforming, etc.
