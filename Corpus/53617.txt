 URL : "https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss/issues/130" TITLE : end year and depletion BODY : @taylori quick question, and probably does not warrant an issue, but here it is. in ssoutput the ts is derived from timeseries timeseries$yr <= endyr + 1, , and consequently depletion for the current year is then calculated from the last row of this data frame and the first row. how come r4ss uses endyr + 1 , when this is also the first year of forecasts for the current depletion? thank you in advance for any information regarding the reasoning behind this. also, why is bratio not used, where ss provides an estimate of variance for this rather than having r4ss calculate depletion?
