 URL : "https://github.com/apicollective/apibuilder/issues/714" TITLE : add json value type BODY : we have a case where a service response is a json array, where the array elements are either string or json object and are unable to model that in apibuilder. currently the must generic apibuilder type is object , but that maps to json object only, not other json values. it would be great to have an apibuilder type that can be an arbitrary json value, ie. an object or a string or a number or an array, etc see https://www.json.org/. suggested name for the new type: value , but could also be called any or json .
