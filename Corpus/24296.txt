 URL : "https://github.com/kelektiv/node-uuid/issues/189" TITLE : slow require of v1 BODY : using require uuid/v1 under electron, i've noticed anywhere from 2x to 4x increase in window load time. i've tracked this to the unwrapped call to rng which in turn synchronously calls crypto.randombytes . from the nodejs docs: the crypto.randombytes method will block until there is sufficient entropy. this should normally never take longer than a few milliseconds. the only time when generating the random bytes may conceivably block for a longer period of time is right after boot, when the whole system is still low on entropy. this is unfortunately the behvaviour i'm seeing. the loading of the entire window is being held up by the call to crypto.randombytes . changing my use of uuid/v1 to uuid/v4 fixes the problem. if there is sufficient interest in modifying uuid/v1 to use the asynchronous version of crypto.randombytes or otherwise wrap the synchronous version so it is not called on require time i would be happy to open a pr.
