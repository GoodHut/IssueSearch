 URL : "https://github.com/hapijs/discuss/issues/563" TITLE : send multipart response BODY : i want to implement a route that responds with a file and some associated metadata. i'd rather not force the client to make two separate requests, which would increase the risk of timing issues related to the resource being updated, etc. let's say, for example, that i have a png image file and a valid json object, both in memory. i already know how to send the file and json separately - the question is how to send them in a single response. something along the lines of... js async handler request, reply { const img = await getimagefroms3 ; const metadata = { width: 1920, height: 1080 }; reply json.stringify metadata + '---boundary---' + img ; } similar to multipart/form-data , but for a response. i found these specs mentioning multipart content types that would seem to apply here. namely, multipart/mixed . - https://www.w3.org/protocols/rfc1341/7_2_multipart.html - https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231 section-3.1.1.4 i know how to set the content-type, if necessary. but how would i serialize the value properly? i guess i need the inverse of pez https://github.com/hapijs/pez . what are other people doing, if not this?
