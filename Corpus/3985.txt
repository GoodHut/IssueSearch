BODY : hi, i'd like to fork the codebase to do some improvements and use it to verify some other behavior, but i noticed this project has no license. can you add a license? if there's no strong preference, mit would be simplest, but really any license that lets me use the code in a derivative work is sufficient. thanks for your time!
