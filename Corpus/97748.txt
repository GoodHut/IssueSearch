BODY : _originally opened: @alfiva 2012-02-16 13:44:23_ _originally closed: 2012-02-16 16:02:07_ if a have a uri of an abstract class, say http://ontology.universaal.org/profile.owl profilable, how can i get an instance of the java class, like new profilable ;? i know it´s abstract, but in rdf and the empty constructor usually not visible . i want to have an &quot;anonymous&quot; instance but only for java purposes. is this possible? how caould i do it with the new data repr?
i have tried with ontologymanagement.getinstance .getresource editeduri, null ; but it didn´t work because it uses ontology factories, and there are no constructors there for abstract classes i could add them but that would be cheating .
i could have a workaround with reflection, but for that i need the name of the class. i think there was something like it in the old data repr. waht should i do with the new one? this is not imperative, i can make some workaround anyway, i just wanted to know if theer is an official new way for this. -- from: _this issue has been automatically imported from our old issue tracker_
