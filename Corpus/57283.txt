 URL : "https://github.com/forax/pro/issues/10" TITLE : pro plugin development BODY : i would like to contribute the following two plugins: - junit-platform-console-standalone-plugin - google-java-format-plugin both underlying tools are packaged as executable jars, which can be call via the command line. that's why i think a more general and configurable download-dependencies-and-execute-plugin would be more useful and be used by other external tools as well. like checkstyle, coverage, etc. an usage outline could read like: set junit.dependencies , list junit-platform-console-standalone:1.0.0-snapshot ... run ... compiler , packager , download-dependencies-and-execute-plugin junit do you think it is worth the effort? currently, i'm using wget/java commands in the .travis.yml build https://github.com/sormuras/beethoven/blob/java9_and_pro/.travis.yml script.
