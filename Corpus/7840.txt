 URL : "https://github.com/ignacio82/IMPosterior/issues/16" TITLE : js build system BODY : since we're using es6 in the js part of this package, we will need a transpilation step in order to make it run in older browsers including the default rsrudio viewer . see discussion started in pr 14 it sounds like there's no great solution to this issue and that the best we're going to get is to do one of the following: 1. write in es6, include build scripts to transpile the code and then include both the es6 source and the transpiled output in the repo pointing r to the transpiled version - upsides: use modern code - downsides: more complex dev workflow, transpiled code needs to be committed, console errors will be more opaque 2. write all js for compatibility with older browsers - upsides: simpler, no change to current workflow - downsides: unmodern, pain to write in old js, leaves us open to problems if es6 code sneaks into the package at any point in the future
