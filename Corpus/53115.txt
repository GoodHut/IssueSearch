 URL : "https://github.com/Icinga/puppet-icingaweb2/issues/119" TITLE : default auth mechanism BODY : the user should be able to set a default authentication mechanism when declaring ::icingaweb2 db, ldap etc. which then gets configured and initialised automatically if possible. dependencies of the chosen auth method should be installed if manage_package is set to true we need this to make it more comfortable for the user to use the module. he should not need to create the resources manually.
