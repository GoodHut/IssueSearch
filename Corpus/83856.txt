 URL : "https://github.com/rnystrom/GitHawk/issues/928" TITLE : comment collapse feature? BODY : would anyone find this useful? imagine being able to tap the header of a comment and it folds to just the header. maybe a little arrow indicating itâ€™s collapsed. i find this useful with huge comment threads on stuff like hacker news and reddit. obviously there are no threads barring pr comments . but maybe collapsing long comments would be nice? we already have collapse-on-load functionality. this could replace that entirely, or just compliment it. useful at all? <details>
