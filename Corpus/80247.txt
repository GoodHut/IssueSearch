 URL : "https://github.com/sparkica/LODRefine/issues/24" TITLE : the future of lodrefine? BODY : hi, with a couple of folks we are trying to revive openrefine. i am particularly keen to gear it towards linked open data and have been working on wikidata integration. lodrefine looks awesome but appears to need some love too! the website is down, the code is well behind openrefine, and so on. what is the way forward? i don't think we'll have enough energy to maintain two projects even if there is of course a lot of overlap . could we imagine extracting the extensions particularly the crowdsourcing one which seems to be original and maintain them as independent projects? it looks also possible to add some extensions to or's repository just like the freebase extension was shipped with google refine . thanks a lot for your work!
