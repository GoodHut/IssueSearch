 URL : "https://github.com/night/BetterTTV/issues/2485" TITLE : better viewer list bug BODY : when using the better viewer list option with any amount of viewers in a twitch channel, after scrolling down a bit, the scroll bar auto scrolls to the bottom of the viewer list making it impossible to view most of the users in chat. this makes it exceptionally difficult for mods to find user that needs to be moderated in a chat.
