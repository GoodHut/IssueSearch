 URL : "https://github.com/vanilla/vanilla/issues/5553" TITLE : switch to psr/container BODY : wait for 5519 before scheduling this. vanilla is currently using version 1.x of the garden-container which implements container-interop/container-interop. since then the psr committee has gotten around to implementing the interfaces and it looks as though projects are switching to that. luckily the interfaces are virtually identical so converting will be more of a search and replace job. - update our dependencies to garden-container ^2.0. - find all references of interop\container\containerinterface and switch them to psr\container\containerinterface .
