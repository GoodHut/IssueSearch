 URL : "https://github.com/devtools-html/devtools-core/issues/69" TITLE : linking is not working BODY : we've seen several issues with linking the debugger to devtools-core packages yarn link client-devtools-adapters yarn link devtools-modules yarn link devtools-launchpad some of the reported issues are sources do not show up likely an issue with client adapters prefs is not defined likely a devtools-modules issue it's possible to link multiple repos i.e. run yarn link client-devtools-adapters and yarn link devtools-launchpad which might be causing issues. is it possible to run yarn unlink client-devtools-adapters ? if so we might want to document that. if not we should document the good old rm -r node_modules approach as devs should know how to uninstall.
