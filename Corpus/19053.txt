BODY : hi, i am currently reading the docs again and i am having a little trouble to understand what the word _runtime_ is supposed to mean. there is the following paragraph in the runtime recipes section which confuses me: > workspaces can have a single runtime or multiple runtimes. che uses docker, though che could handle runtimes other than docker, to create runtime s from dockerfiles for a single-container runtime, or compose files to create single-container/multi-container runtime s . che could handle runtimes other than docker suggests that docker itself is the runtime, but the next part to create runtime s from dockerfiles tells me, that i am creating runtimes with dockerfiles/composefiles. from my understanding, dockerfiles create runtime-machines not the runtimes itself. what is a runtime in this context? thank you.
