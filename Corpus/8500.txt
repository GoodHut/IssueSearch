 URL : "https://github.com/cachilders/backpat/issues/24" TITLE : package as tree BODY : with the introduction of yarn.lock parsing, and the next goal of recursively identifying sub-dependencies in required packages, it makes sense to bundle the dependencies as a tree, with the subdependencies of each dependency packaged in a children hash. this will give the consumer the choice of how granular their presentation ought to be. current: flat presentation of all dependencies http://www.backpat.site/ . holy smokes what a mess! ideal: hierarchical presentation of directly required deps with their subordinate deps and _their_ subordinate deps nested in the hash. { sweetpkg: { ... dependencies: { lodash: { ... } }
