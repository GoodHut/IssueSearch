 URL : "https://github.com/elementary/appstream-redirect/issues/15" TITLE : metadata isn't helpful BODY : when people share the link on social media it just shows as elementary appcenter with the appcenter icon, which isn't great for devs advertising their app. 8 would probably solve this completely, but for now it should at least use the name and icon of whatever app is being shared
