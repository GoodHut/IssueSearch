 URL : "https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/790" TITLE : <slot> can be nested BODY : i misread this â€” it turns out you can nest https://webkit.org/blog/4096/introducing-shadow-dom-api/ <slot> elements in web components, so we should too: html <b>name</b>: <slot name= fullname > <slot name= firstname ></slot> <slot name= lastname ></slot> </slot><br> <b>email</b>: <slot name= email >unknown</slot><br> <b>address</b>: <slot name= address >unknown</slot> if no slot='fullname' element was provided, it would render the slot='firstname' and slot='lastname' ones instead. should be straightforward, i think it's just a case of removing the validation.
