BODY : we need some basic unit and integration tests to make sure that changes to this repo don't break functionality. this is particularly necessary for upgrading to python 2/3. we'll eventually want to integrate with circleci and github so that we can evaluate pull requests from the web. a list to start: - unit tests for each method in tuner.py and selector.py - test selectors with different kinds of input to make sure they make the right choices - test tuners with different kinds of input to make sure they don't break and make logical choices - end-to-end tests with different sklearn classifiers to make sure hyperparameter typing is handled correctly
