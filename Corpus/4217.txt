 URL : "https://github.com/proxysh/Safejumper-for-Desktop/issues/6" TITLE : app logs & ssd BODY : safejumper writes to disk too many openvpn logs and debug logs until running. it writes every second new data to disk. that may be not good for ssd. how about to do optional logging with enable/disable checkboxes in app settings? i got proxy.sh and want to use safejumper app with it. but so often write-on-disk operations looks terrible for ssd in my laptop. i think other users with ssd will have same things about it.
