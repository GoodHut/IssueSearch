 URL : "https://github.com/emsec/ChameleonMini/issues/117" TITLE : emulating desfire 4k ev1? BODY : hello, i was wondering if it is currently possible to emulate mifare desfire 4k ev1 cards? i saw on the home page https://github.com/emsec/chameleonmini/wiki : cards that the chameleonmini can emulate in principle include: nxp mifare classic, plus, ultralight, ultralight c, ntag, icode, desfire / desfire ev1 but it's not clear what in principle means, and i am not seeing any configuration https://rawgit.com/emsec/chameleonmini/master/doc/doxygen/html/page_configurations.html in the official documentation for doing this. this may be related to 31, though its not clear what functionality has been merged into chameleonmini/master, or if that is one of the goals of that fork. thanks!
