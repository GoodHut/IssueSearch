 URL : "https://github.com/ua-parser/uap-go/issues/38" TITLE : 32 bit systems BODY : go does not provide automatic alignment for the 32 bit system in sync/atomic/asm_386.s we see that the 64 bit operations have the following preamble: movl addr+0 fp , bp testl $7, bp jz 2 pc movl 0, ax // crash with nil ptr deref so that means that it will crash on arm/32 bit systems your code due to the fact it uses atomic.loaduint64 we can use a lock or manual alignment if you insist on using the loaduint64
