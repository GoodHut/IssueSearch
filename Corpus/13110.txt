 URL : "https://github.com/react-tools/react-table/issues/511" TITLE : support react 16 BODY : what version of react-table are you using? 6.5.3 what bug are you experiencing, or what feature are you proposing? if you are upgrading to the new react version 16.0.0 it will still install the peer dependency react 15.4.2. the application will crash. you already fixed the issue in your master branch by adding react : ^15.x.x || ^16.x.x in package.json it would be great if you can release a new npm version with this change that we can migrate to the new react version! thank you
