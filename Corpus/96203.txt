 URL : "https://github.com/commercetools/nodejs/issues/84" TITLE : enforce git commit message BODY : description after reading this https://github.com/commercetools/nodejs/pull/74 issuecomment-279774679 it got me thinking on how to enforce the git commit message. it seems that only with github enterprise you can define server side hooks but what we can do is: only allow rebasing prs that pass the ci and adding a commit message check at the ci. shouldn't be to difficult to do and prevents any human error possibility. thoughts? @hisabimbola @emmenko
