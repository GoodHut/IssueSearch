 URL : "https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security-oauth/issues/1240" TITLE : spring boot 2.x support BODY : spring boot 1.x provided integration with spring-security-oauth project that has been removed in spring boot 2.x in favor of spring security 5. spring boot does not want to provide support for spring-security-oauth going forward since going forward spring security 5 is the recommendation for oauth. spring security 5 plans to provide all the features found in spring-security-oauth, but does not yet do so. for example, it is missing resttemplate integration, resource server, and authorization server support. we should provide a jar that provides the spring boot 1.x oauth integration for spring boot 2. this jar's life cycle will be maintained along with spring-security-oauth project and allow users to continue to support the workflows they had in spring boot 1.x with spring-security-oauth until spring security 5 oauth support is ready to be fully migrated to.
