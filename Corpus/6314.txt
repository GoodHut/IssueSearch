 URL : "https://github.com/w3c/html/issues/774" TITLE : add <h> element BODY : we need a heading element without implicit order. we need a heading element that can be updated without being replaced. please consider <h> . the <h> element is desired for situations where the “ranking” context changes for a heading, either before or after the source is sent to the browser. the current process of figuring out the appropriate “rank” of a heading is as unnecessary as requiring <li> to be <l1-n> . which also brings up a secondary point; there are not only 6 levels of headings. so, please, please thoughtfully consider a single heading element like <h> , which would represent the heading for its section . the “rank” of such elements would be determined by outline depth https://w3c.github.io/html/sections.html outline-depth . if it helps, this addition might be developed on the shoulders of the xhtml 2 <h> element proposal https://www.w3.org/tr/xhtml2/mod-structural.html sec_8.5. , or @stevefaulkner’s html5-h proposal https://github.com/thepaciellogroup/html5-h html5-h which answers to this bug https://www.w3.org/bugs/public/show_bug.cgi?id=25003 . i believe steve recognized that a fiction of the document outline https://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2013/10/html5-document-outline/ was its retroactive impact on <h1-6> elements, which this new element would not be impacted by. should there be concerns regarding the time between specification and implementation, polyfills https://w3ctag.github.io/polyfills/ like the one the paciello group created would provide developers an appropriate and accessible fallback before the new element is widely adopted. things like this have been done in similar situations, like with <picture> not being recognized in all browsers for a time, or with <nav role= navigation > not being recognized with an implicit landmark.
