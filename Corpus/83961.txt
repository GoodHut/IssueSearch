 URL : "https://github.com/WICG/scroll-boundary-behavior/issues/21" TITLE : confusion about example 2 BODY : there's something that doesn't make sense to me about example 2: > a page wants to implement their own pull-to-refresh effect and thus needs to disable browser native overscroll action. > > > html { > / only disable pull-to-refresh but allow swipe navigations / > scroll-boundary-behavior-y: contain; > } > > > in this case, the author can use contain on the viewport defining element to prevent overscroll from triggering navigation actions. the stated objective is to disable browser native overscroll action , but the suggestion is to use contain , which only disabled non-local boundary actions, and overscroll effects are defined to be local boundary actions. shouldn't none be used in this case? the comment only disable pull-to-refresh but allow swipe navigations doesn't make sense to me either. pull-to-refresh is not a browser behaviour to be disabled to begin with, and swipe navigations, being a non-local boundary action, would be disabled by either contain or none . clarification of this example would be appreciated.
