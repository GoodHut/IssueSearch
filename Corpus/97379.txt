 URL : "https://github.com/concourse/semver-resource/issues/34" TITLE : git tag with smart tagging BODY : if you have a long pipeline with a bunch of checks until you get to the point you would like to version it there might be new changes added to the git repo. when a git driver is used it is very misleading to assume that the commit that changes the file from one version to another which is out of the concourse control is a delimiter between versions - if you do it in the same repo - because the actual version change potentially happened several commits earlier. with git-tag used as versioning - this issue seems even more severe because intuitively the tag is put on the exact commit. this is a sample implementation that overcomes this issue with getting as argument the git_resource and taking the sha from it: https://github.com/ggeorgiev/semver-resource/tree/my_ci
