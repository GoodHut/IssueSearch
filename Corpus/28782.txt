 URL : "https://github.com/OpenTSDB/opentsdb/issues/1028" TITLE : http api delete bug BODY : i am using the http api to delete a metric, but after the deletion, the metric still shows in queries. in addition, after deleting the metric, the metric's datapoints are empty and the last timestamp has been set to zero. i am running the delete from a node.js delete request with a url like the following: https://tsdb-server:9443/api/query?start=1y-ago&,m=sum:testmetric i get a 200 response even though the metric still appears in subsequent queries.
