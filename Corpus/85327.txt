 URL : "https://github.com/pfn/keepasshttp/issues/345" TITLE : exact url matching please BODY : i am running into issues where username/password fields are being filled out on pages that shouldn't be. if you have for example a wordpress website with woocommerce you use keepass to store the login credentials. the problem is that if for example you have paypal express checkout installed and you go to configure it the username and passwords fields are being filled in with the wordpress login information. the problem is that if you have stored correct information and you switch to this then the username/password of the paypal api are overwritten with your wordpress credentials. i just came across https://www.kee.pm/ for firefox which adds additional settings to each keepass entry. one of them being exact url match . by selecting this on the wordpress login page entry for the site it keeps it from destroying other username/password fields like the above in the admin area. it would be great if keepasshttp could do the same so i can use it in chromeipass and don't have to keep disabling the plugin or create multiple entries to stop auto-entry.
