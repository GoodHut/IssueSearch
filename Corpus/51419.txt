 URL : "https://github.com/impress/impress.js/issues/611" TITLE : alternative next slide BODY : use case: i have a big presentation i'll use regularly. sometimes i want to go into the details of a topic, sometimes not. editing the presentation constantly or skipping all slides by hand is possible, but not really convenient. if you press alt + arrow key, the presentation will jump to the referenced slide instead of the next slide. as far as i have understood impress.js something like this doesn't exist, does it?
