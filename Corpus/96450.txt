 URL : "https://github.com/leggomuhgreggo/events-map/issues/4" TITLE : event submission interface BODY : initially i had this set up to use the rest endpoint to post issues from form data, but the auth seemed dicey and i thought it would be preferable to use whatever form plugin to register new events. i guess that's kind of pending a decision there, which i'll try to get an answer to soon.
