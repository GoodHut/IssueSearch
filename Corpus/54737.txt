 URL : "https://github.com/wesnoth/wesnoth/issues/2219" TITLE : high dpi hidpi support BODY : wesnoth is too small to be playable using my laptop's native screen resolution 276 dpi . it would be nice to have the option for pixel doubling or scaling of individual elements. currently there is a text-scaling option but it's very buggy layout not adjusted so lots of clipping occurs , and maxes out at 150% still small .
