 URL : "https://github.com/OpenKitten/MongoKitten/issues/146" TITLE : git tag confusion BODY : i have been attempting to use mongokitten for some scripting, in particular with https://github.com/johnsundell/marathon it seems that there are some old tags 5.0.0-beta1 and 5.0.0-obbut2 that don't seem to match the current github releases. however these cause some issues with tools using git tags to identify the most recent release. would it be possible to delete these tags?
