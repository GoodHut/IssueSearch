 URL : "https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/issues/259" TITLE : add multisite support BODY : currently, the plugin is only built to support a single site instance, but i think it would be really powerful to add some support for multisite. behind the scenes, i think this could potentially be pretty simple... we could essentially have a site query to select a site to perform an operation for, and then just use switch_to_blog behind the scenes. would be great to get some community involvement on this issue, since none of us maintainers are actively using multisite.
