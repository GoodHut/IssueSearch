 URL : "https://github.com/epigen/looper/issues/145" TITLE : logging info in cli help BODY : from @afrendeiro > could there be an easy way to let the user see some of the logging options in the cli without cluttering too much the --help message? right now one has to look at the code to activate more verbose logging... the --dbg option doesn't seem to do anything for me, i still get the same amount of detail. when using the interactive session however as described in 129 , i do get more detail. in the information provided, describe the requirement on the location of --dbg within the command in order to get the desired effect.
