 URL : "https://github.com/P1514/Diversity/issues/68" TITLE : fetching snapshot url BODY : an endpoint must be created to provide snapshots related to a specific pss. example: outside tool sends a request to sentiment analysis asking for information on pss: d522-1 , sentiment analysis must answer accordingly with the list of snapshots for that specific pss, snapshots regarding the same range of dates redudant should be filtered out of the answer. this requires both backend implementation and front-end implementation. front-end converts the snapshots existing from normal path to url. implementation should be done in a restful request like operation.
