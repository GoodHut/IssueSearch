 URL : "https://github.com/redstone/LegacyFactions/issues/240" TITLE : few bugs / issues :d BODY : <!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------~> please remember to provide the output of the command /f debug . put it on pastebin.com : <~-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------> <!-- write your issue under this line --> i love the whole plugin! found a couple little bugs/ issues which i would need you to fix before i release my server to the public. when you make a claim in wilderness, it says your faction claimed land for your faction from your faction. the problem here is it should say your faction claimed land for your faction from wilderness as your making a claim. in /f help the forward option to go to the next page it has <aqua>go to page 2. it's not showing the colour. and same goes for going back to a page it says <aqua>go to page 1. when you /f unclaim it doesn't log in chat although it's enabled in the config. also, i recommend adding in the config an option to use the factionsuuid claiming system. the claiming radius is much easier. please do consider because it'll make your plugin much better. when you do /f ban or /f unban a player and the name is incorrect or unknown it'll say in chat <b> unknown player. please fix this colour symbol issue. please don't take any of this above as negativity! just trying to make it better : thankyou i'll also be advertising this plugin if you fix the bugs as mentioned above. have a good day! jake :
