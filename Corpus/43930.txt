 URL : "https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/issues/8281" TITLE : docs for ftp scanners BODY : from talk on irc today, @itsmeroy2012 requested a ticket for some more docs. i would recommend docs for: 1. ftp_login auxiliary/scanner/ftp/ftp_login 2. anonymous auxiliary/scanner/ftp/anonymous 3. ftp_version auxiliary/scanner/ftp/ftp_version in the vulnerable application part of the docs, i would include instructions on how to install ftp server on kali http://www.gosecure.it/blog/art/93/note/install-ftp-server-on-kali-linux/ may help and windows https://www.iis.net/learn/install/installing-publishing-technologies/installing-and-configuring-ftp-7-on-iis-7 . this section can be used for all 3 docs! similar to other scanners for basic and old services, i think it can be helpful to show how to replicate the result on another tool or two. see https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/documentation/modules/auxiliary/scanner/nfs/nfsmount.md confirming for an example. here's what i would recommend for showing how to replicate the results in other tools: 1. ftp_login auxiliary/scanner/ftp/ftp_login - https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ftp-brute.html - how to login with the standard ftp command line on linux or via netcat/telnet . only need 1 of these 2. anonymous auxiliary/scanner/ftp/anonymous - https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ftp-anon.html
