BODY : what i want to achieve: - put a shutter device to suspend mode for 240 minutes in general whenever it's value is changed by the visu for example - put the same shutter to suspend mode for only 3 minutes if a specific switch was triggered i figured out that i can somehow implement two separate suspend states for one specific item in general. but what doesn't work is a setting the correct end time, b retrigger the rules evaluation after the additionally set suspend time. because var:item.suspend_remaining is only connected to the standard suspend item. any chance to change the way var:item.suspend_remaining works? let's say instead of item someone could actually define the item name, i.e. var: as_suspend_remaining_additionalsuspend whereas as_item_additionalsuspend points to the additional suspend item. the insert_suspend_time function also seems to be strictly connected to the standard suspend item. 2017-10-29 22:15:33.577968 executing method 'insert_suspend_time ..suspend_taster, %x ' 2017-10-29 22:15:33.581515 suspend time is 14400 2017-10-29 22:15:33.585726 suspend item is screens.westen_s3.automatik.suspend_taster 2017-10-29 22:15:33.588794 current suspend age: 118.691951 2017-10-29 22:15:33.596388 remaining suspend time: 14281.308049 2017-10-29 22:15:33.598948 suspend finished at 2017-10-30 02:13:34.906300+01:00 it would be awesome to set the suspend_time for a specific item like this: eval:autoblind_eval.insert_suspend_time '..suspend_taster', suspend_text='%x' and the plugin knows that the correct time is read from the as_suspend_time_taster?
