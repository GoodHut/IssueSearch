 URL : "https://github.com/NguyenDanPhuong/MangaRipper/issues/44" TITLE : mangaripper will not start BODY : i'm using the latest version 1.0.173 but when i extract it and launch the program, nothing happens. windows smartscreen warns me about it on the first try but i run it anyway. i tried disabling it to see if it was preventing it from launching regardless, but it still refuses to start.
