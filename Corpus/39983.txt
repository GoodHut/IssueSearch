 URL : "https://github.com/gappleto97/overpassify/issues/21" TITLE : support while blocks BODY : i'm mostly making this so i can point to it later. as near as i can tell, while will be impossible to fully implement in this language. it requires two things: 1. the ability to emulate a conditional branch done 2. the ability to either go back to a different point in code or loop indefinitely and escape that second point looks impossible here. i would me happy to be shown wrong though.
