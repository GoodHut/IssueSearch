 URL : "https://github.com/dmwm/WMCore/issues/7647" TITLE : package wmcore into pypi BODY : i was wanting to float the idea of pushing wmcore into pypi so it can be easily be pulled into other projects. setuptools already handles it via python setup.py upload , but that requires credentials, whch kinda makes bin/buildrelease.sh not the right place to put it, since whoever built a release would need to have pypi credentials. the other option is to add the hooks into the rpm bot or jenkins to publish new releases. that's a bit easier since those hosts are secured and could keep the credentials secret. anyway, it'd be useful to have wmcore well, a lot of dmwm's code, honestly in pypi. if there's no objection, i'd like to put the hooks in to get it pushed up automagically
