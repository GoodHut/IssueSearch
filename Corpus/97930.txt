 URL : "https://github.com/servalproject/serval-dna/issues/131" TITLE : identity did & name length BODY : when you try to set the name and/or did of an identity, the values are silently truncated at 63 and 31 bytes respectively. it would be nice if you could produce an error when the input size exceeds these limits rather than just silently dropping letters. if that is not possible, then it would nice if this behaviour could at least be documented. on a realted note: the 5-digit minimum for dids is actually not enforced anywhere.
