 URL : "https://github.com/TextureGroup/Texture/issues/662" TITLE : manual layout option BODY : is there interest in a secondary layout method option instead of layoutspecthatfits : , something where you could manually set all the positions and frames of nodes, and return that all as a block? i feel these abstracted layout configurations add unnecessary obfuscation and effort, it being much easier to just explicitly tell the computer where stuff goes and how big it should be lol
