BODY : visualizing a long mode slows the browser immensely, and is difficult to view. we should have a way to smartly prune data based on magnitude perhaps? . for instance, when projecting into a word matrix, maybe there is a smart way to only show some of the words like top 100 or something . or, do something nice with zooming in/out.
