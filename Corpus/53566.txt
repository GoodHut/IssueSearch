 URL : "https://github.com/rbeezer/mathbook/issues/727" TITLE : eliminate empty html p BODY : whatever is causing empty html p tags should be examined and then handled in a different way. gather examples here, and then discuss what to do. links to the html are preferred. i'd like the the solution to not involve wrapping a collection of items in a div, because the things that can appear adjacent to that div may need to be handled as a special case. but if we have to, we have to.
