 URL : "https://github.com/soberwp/controller/issues/37" TITLE : custom template controller BODY : hi! tl;dr by the way wordpress saves custom page template path and how sage expands it into possible template files one cannot create controller based on page template file name. current behavior let's say we have a custom page template located in views/template-custom.blade.php . the following is available controller hierarchy: hierarchy debugger: /controllers/app.php /controllers/index.php /controllers/resources/views/singular.php /controllers/singular.php /controllers/views/singular.php /controllers/resources/views/page.php /controllers/page.php /controllers/views/page.php /controllers/resources/views/page-4.php /controllers/page-4.php /controllers/views/page-4.php /controllers/resources/views/page-signup.php /controllers/page-signup.php /controllers/views/page-signup.php expected behavior controller hierarchy should include /controllers/template-custom.php and /controllers/views/template-custom.php . details let's get back to our custom template located in views/template-custom.blade.php . wordpress saves it's exact path and serves as template name. then sage's template_hierarchy filter expands it https://github.com/roots/sage/blob/master/app/helpers.php l82 into following locations : resources/views/views/template-custom.blade.php resources/views/views/template-custom.blade.blade.php views/template-custom.blade.php views/template-custom.blade.blade.php views/views/template-custom.blade.php views/views/template-custom.blade.blade.php i know, it looks broken but it does it's job the list includes original template path . i'm not sure if this should be 'fixed' by sage or bypassed by controller.
