 URL : "https://github.com/ksundberg/CourseMaterials/issues/10" TITLE : extra job schedule BODY : i was able to work around or fix every bug except for there is an odd edge case where a single job is scheduled an extra time. this happens every time the simulator is run but only happens once per run. i cannot figure out where it is getting scheduled. i worked around that by ignoring iodone and jobdone for tasks that are already finished. my fixed version of the simulator is attatched. scheduler.tar.gz https://github.com/ksundberg/coursematerials/files/886951/scheduler.tar.gz
