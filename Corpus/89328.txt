 URL : "https://github.com/CurrentlyNotSet/SERB/issues/403" TITLE : prod040 - new party issue BODY : editing party information/bookmark error need the ability to edit party information especially when the information is entered improperly originally. this is for the sake of efficiency. in case 2017-rep-03-0042, the employer was entered improperly in that the phone number was entered in the email column. we brought up the party card, but was unable to change/delete the phone number which was entered in the wrong column. as a work-around, i had to enter the employer information again as a new party-add it to the search list-delete the employer from the parties tab that was erroneously entered and add the new listing that i recently created to the party information tab. see next page. ! image https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8847344/24523477/29ab6656-1561-11e7-9800-0d3d6dd676b1.png
