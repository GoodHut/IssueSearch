 URL : "https://github.com/docura-io/vscode-cm/issues/42" TITLE : user defined scripts BODY : an idea i've had was to have a specifically named cm file that has a list of void functions, and the extension could read all the functions in that file and then expose them threw the f1 menu in vscode to allow the user to run those functions at any time. could be useful in a workspace to have cache clearing code for development etc.
