 URL : "https://github.com/OpenHumans/open-humans/issues/680" TITLE : 'data selfie' granularity BODY : being able to control which data selfie data is public and which is restricted would be a welcome addition. i have multiple data selfie files, many of which i wouldn't mind sharing: including caffeine intake and sleep records, mris, etc; but also data selfie records like xml and other ccr / ccd formats that include things like prescription filling histories with both pharmacy, insurance, and home information, that i feel are useful for research but don't care to be public. changing the data selfie sharing option from a single bucket to granular by file system would allow greater public sharing of data on my part, and i believe others.
