 URL : "https://github.com/limonte/sweetalert2/issues/612" TITLE : inject css into js? BODY : hello everyone, should we get rid of standalone css file and inject styles dynamically in js? if we do so, https://github.com/limonte/sweetalert2/issues/422 will be fixed for free and many users will get a better dx developer experience . there's probably some rollup plugin which will help up handle this, but i didn't perform any research on that. i'd like to hear your opinions and technical suggestions how to implement this in a nice and efficient way. cc @toverux @samturrell
