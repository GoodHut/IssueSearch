 URL : "https://github.com/Jawbone/JBChartView/issues/226" TITLE : bar origin above 0 BODY : i have a requirement where i want to draw the bars with dynamic origin points. for example one bar will start from 1.2 and may be end at 4.2, so the height will be 3.0 or one bar starts at 2.3 and ends at 4.9 the point is that i want to have different origin for bars other than 0 which is the defaults implementation. is there any way that i can achieve this? thanks.
