 URL : "https://github.com/carnivalmobile/carnival-sdk-cordova/issues/4" TITLE : android registration issue BODY : on app start, i am getting the gcm registration error java.io.ioexception: invalid_parameters error after carnival.startengine true is called from the javascript. however, i discovered that if i background the app, and then foreground it, the app's mainactivity.onstart method is called again and then the carnival registration will work correctly without my app passing in anything else. this suggests that my configuration parameters are correct, but somehow the timing of calls is not. any ideas or suggestions to fix this?
