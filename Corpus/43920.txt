BODY : greetings, apologies if this is not the correct place as it is just a general question, not an issue , but i was wondering if there is any changelog, or a frequency at which the docker images are updated? for example, i made some visual changes to kibana, and i noticed that they were wiped out late last night. after checking it seems that a bunch of new docker images were pushed. i understand this is intended, but was hoping to get more information about what changed? thank you!
