 URL : "https://github.com/slack-ruby/slack-ruby-bot/issues/162" TITLE : display name support? BODY : i'm currently using slackbotsy for my bot, which gives me the user_id and user_name for a message posted to a channel. in the slack-ruby-bot i see data.user but it's not clear to me what that contains. can i get something like data.user.display_name ? forgive me for being lazy and asking before i rip out the existing bot gem and replace it.
