 URL : "https://github.com/scoin/multichain-node/issues/23" TITLE : set timeout for a command BODY : i am running benchmark tests for multichain, and using this library to do publish stream actions. when i increase the send rate to something like 100 transactions per second multichainobject.publish command , i start getting error: connect etimedout or error: read econnreset . is there a way to set a timeout for a command, or do i need to explicitly encapsulate this publish call in a settimeout function? what is the correct approach here?
