 URL : "https://github.com/golang/go/issues/20211" TITLE : time: list timezones BODY : i'd like to propose to add a function to the time package that lists the set of installed timezones. for a good user experience, i want my service to provide auto completion or a drop-down for a user to select their timezone; currently, the time package only supports probing, which would make for a bad user-experience. in theory, this could be provided outside of the stdlib by walking the corresponding directory trees; however, for different systems, different directories are used, so this would require duplicating those lists and keeping them in sync with the stdlib manually otherwise you might claim to support a timezone, which you then not actually support; again, a bad user experience . i'd write this myself, but wanted to first get an opinion on whether this would be accepted. system details go version go1.8.1 linux/amd64 goarch= amd64 gobin= goexe= gohostarch= amd64 gohostos= linux goos= linux gopath= gorace= goroot= /home/axelw/go gotooldir= /home/axelw/go/pkg/tool/linux_amd64 gccgo= gccgo cc= gcc gogccflags= -fpic -m64 -pthread -fmessage-length=0 -fdebug-prefix-map=/tmp/go-build049658130=/tmp/go-build -gno-record-gcc-switches cxx= g++ cgo_enabled= 1 pkg_config= pkg-config cgo_cflags= -g -o2 cgo_cppflags= cgo_cxxflags= -g -o2 cgo_fflags= -g -o2 cgo_ldflags= -g -o2 goroot/bin/go version: go version go1.8.1 linux/amd64 goroot/bin/go tool compile -v: compile version go1.8.1 x:framepointer uname -sr: linux 4.4.0-72-generic distributor id:	ubuntu description:	ubuntu 14.04.5 lts release:	14.04 codename:	trusty /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: gnu c library ubuntu eglibc 2.19-0ubuntu6.11 stable release version 2.19, by roland mcgrath et al. gdb --version: gnu gdb gdb 7.9-gg19
