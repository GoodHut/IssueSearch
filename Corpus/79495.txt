 URL : "https://github.com/angular/material2/issues/5635" TITLE : sidenav ignores fxlayout BODY : bug, feature request, or proposal: no matter what fxlayout settings i put on the <!-- primary content --> part of the sidenav, the width remains the width of the content. what is the expected behavior? the contents should obey fxlayout functionality, as the old sidebar did in angularjs material. what is the current behavior? while abc is centred vertically, it is not centred horizontally. instead the div takes up only the width of the content. what are the steps to reproduce? <md-sidenav-container fxflex fxlayout= fill > <md-sidenav opened= true > sidebar </md-sidenav> <div fxflex fxlayout= fill fxlayoutalign= center center > abc </div> </md-sidenav-container> what is the use-case or motivation for changing an existing behavior? it doesn't work as i believe a lot of people coming from angularjs material would expect. which versions of angular, material, os, typescript, browsers are affected? angular - 4.2.5 material - 2.0.0-beta.7 os - windows 10 typescript - 3.10.10 browsers - chrome 59 is there anything else we should know? the issue seems to come from the fact that the component takes the content and wraps it in an extra div.
