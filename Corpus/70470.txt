 URL : "https://github.com/Feefa/Thingy/issues/12" TITLE : web site identification BODY : it seems that there's a design flaw in the web server. when adding the first new site to the first application it became obvious that the initial intention was to have a different port for each web site. - the server adds a prefix for each web site to the http listener - no attempt is made to dedupe prefixes - the code around determining web site from the name is horrible propose removing the web site identification by name altogether and using port number. we don't even need a default web site then. every request will find a web site. might be worth implementing the port reservation enhancement at the same time.
