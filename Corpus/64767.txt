 URL : "https://github.com/walmartlabs/lacinia-pedestal/issues/28" TITLE : hot to return an error? BODY : hi, i'm looking for a little clarification on the documentation. on this page: http://lacinia-pedestal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/response.html there is the statement field resolvers may return error maps. if an error map contains a :status key, this value will be used as the overall http status of the response. i'm returning {:ok false, :errors :opportunity/display_name is required , :status 400} is this correct? in graphiql i'm getting a 200 http response with all fields set null.
