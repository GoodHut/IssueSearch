 URL : "https://github.com/marmelab/admin-on-rest/issues/614" TITLE : tests not passing BODY : /src/mui/field/datefield.spec.js 18 , /src/mui/field/datefield.spec.js 28 and /src/mui/field/datefield.spec.js 38 the test may fail because of the timezone. by default a date is set on 00:00:00 . my timezone is utc-3 so on the datefield tests the time shows the wrong date previous day at 21:00:00 . also it asked for aor-json-rest-client , aor-language-french and aor-rich-text-input when running the tests. is something missing on package.json ?
