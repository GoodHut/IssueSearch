 URL : "https://github.com/DeclareDesign/fabricatr/issues/9" TITLE : remove by functionality BODY : to add variables from multiple datasets, users should pre-merge their data and provide to fabricate_data data = my_merged_data, countries = level , regions = level main argument is that merging is complicated and shouldn't be in fabricatr. currently you could do this case in another way, which would be removed, which does: countries_data <- fabricate_data n = 2, id_label = countries , gdp = rnorm n regions_data <- fabricate_data countries = level n = 2 , regions = level n = 2, elevation = rnorm n full_data <- fabricate_data countries = level data = countries_data, new_country_variable = rnorm n , regions = level data = regions_data, by = countries , new_region_variable = rnorm n
