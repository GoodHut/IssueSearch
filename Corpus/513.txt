 URL : "https://github.com/catrenelle/CatBot/issues/12" TITLE : ally role BODY : other staff members have asked for an option to make members unable to remove the ally role from themselves through the bot, potentially with a message letting the person know to contact staff. this way, a staff member would definitely be aware of this and cis people would be less likely to get around being clearly visible as such, for safety reasons.
