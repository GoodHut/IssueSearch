 URL : "https://github.com/colorjs/color-composite/issues/2" TITLE : compose non-parsed colors BODY : hi @jamen! very nice to see your contribution! how about letting any color input be composed? it feels natural to pass color as a string: js let color = compose 'rgba 255,0,0,.4 ', 'rgba 0,255,0,.8 ', 'gray' //color === 'rgba ...composed values... ' that interface would be similar to color-interpolate https://github.com/colorjs/color-interpolate
