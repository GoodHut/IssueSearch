 URL : "https://github.com/callahad/quick-accept-language-switcher/issues/4" TITLE : extension doesn't work BODY : this extension doesn't appear to work at all in firefox 52.0.1. checking the accept-language header in the network tab indicates that nothing changed despite the button icon indicating a change. the extension also doesn't clearly indicate what the required syntax is; does it use the full header syntax, a partial syntax excluding the ; q= component or what?
