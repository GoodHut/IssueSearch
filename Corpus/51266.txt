 URL : "https://github.com/Admin9705/The-Awesome-Plex-Server/issues/30" TITLE : added emby into docker BODY : i've made another pull request for those that fancy using emby alongside plex. i am new to emby and am still trying to figure it all out, it is better at transcoding subtitles than plex, but not so great when it comes to metadata and folder organisation, so i'll be using both depending on whether i need subtitles or not.
