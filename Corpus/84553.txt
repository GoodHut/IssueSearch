 URL : "https://github.com/nehakadam/DateTimePicker/issues/132" TITLE : defaultdate does not work BODY : i have a code that initializes datetimepicker on a dynamic div . in all cases, either mindate or maxdate is set, with the other being null . however, although defaultdate is set, the ui always shows current date, and not the defaultdate. if i console this.settings.defaultdate in beforeshow , the date is the one i have set on it. however the displayed date is always the current date. what could be the reason? is it because the div is dynamically added? using version 0.1.38
