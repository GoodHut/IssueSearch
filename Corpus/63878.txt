 URL : "https://github.com/Lordician/Tinkers-Fantasy/issues/19" TITLE : extended reach modifier BODY : i would like to implement the extended reach as a modifier in tinker's construct. this would allow harvest tools to harvest from further away and weapons to reach targets from further away. this way i can give this modifier to extended reach weapons by default as well, explaining what it does in the book.
