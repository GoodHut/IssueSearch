 URL : "https://github.com/metabase/metabase/issues/5479" TITLE : pulses need more tests BODY : 1441 introduced the pulses feature way back in 0.13.0. it added about 4000 loc, but by my count, only added five tests. this means huge chunks of functionality including relatively easy things like mocking the email sending function and writing tests to check that emails are actually sent to the right people were never tested and still aren't. afaik there aren't frontend tests around anything either. this is a tragedy i think we should rectify when we get a free moment. i'm happy to write some of these tests, especially ones for things like the email sending as mentioned above
