 URL : "https://github.com/graphcool/chromeless/issues/301" TITLE : pool of tabs BODY : when at least one chromeless window is open, any subsequent calls to chromeless would open a new tab and when the computation is done, closes it. it would be nice if there is a chromeless.start function etc. to simply spawn a global headless chrome. this would greatly reduce startup time etc. when developing. since most chromeless.end calls simply closes the tab, having a global chrome open won't affect existing code at all.
