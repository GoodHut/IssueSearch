 URL : "https://github.com/github/octocatalog-diff/issues/72" TITLE : enc parameter override BODY : feature request: add the ability to override parameters supplied by the enc, in the same way as the --fact-override stuff currently works. since we just write the enc's output into a file https://github.com/github/octocatalog-diff/blob/master/lib/octocatalog-diff/catalog-util/builddir.rb l201-l206 it shouldn't be that hard to intercept and manipulate the text before we write it there.
