BODY : you write: > todo: add some charts of learning progress, give final accuracy values. it would be great to get those charts of loss values throughout training it's easy to compare against, because your loss is just nll of a softmax across 361 categories, and thus will be inherently comparable to clark and storkey's final loss values around 2.2 . i'm trying to reproduce your results, and it'd be great to know if i'm track, especially because the training period you mention is so long.
