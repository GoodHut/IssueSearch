 URL : "https://github.com/ionide/DebugSample/issues/3" TITLE : it could be less confusing BODY : i found the fact that the sample f project was named clr to be very confusing. when i got an error that something could not find clr.exe , i immediately assumed it was looking for some file that came with the .net framework, so i wasted a lot of time looking for that file. i suggest renaming the sample project as demo or mysampleproject . also, the instructions could be more detailed, such as step 2. build.cmd / build.sh could instead be 2. run build.cmd at the command line or run build.sh from powershell. even after figuring all that out, the prebuild task build clr still would not run. however, by commenting that line out of the launch.json file, i was able to debug anyway.
