 URL : "https://github.com/UltimateHackingKeyboard/agent/issues/329" TITLE : use bootstrap tooltip BODY : right now, we only have a single tooltip which you can see by hovering over the question mark icon located rightwards of the long press action of the keypress tab of the key action popover. please use bootstrap tooltip http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/ tooltips instead, and make use of its html feature because i'd like to add html content to this tooltip soon. i'd also like to experiment with styles, and have no idea about where to override bootstrap tooltip styles, so please create a file for it and increase the padding a bit, so that we can check that it's working and i'll be able to tweak it further.
