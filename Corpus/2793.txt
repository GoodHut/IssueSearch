 URL : "https://github.com/marioballano/emudore/issues/5" TITLE : emu as os poc BODY : hello, i wanted to say thank you for sharing this work and congratulations. your code is the closest emulation i could work with successfully. my aim has always been to take a c64 emulator and modify it so that an x86 or arm could boot right into it, bare metal, instead of needing an os to load it. basically the emulation is the operating system...making your pc a c64. i took the code you have here and did exactly that. i crossed it with some barebones os code, and after many days of struggling, was able to get something working as a proof of concept. id really love to see something like this continue to develop. we have android running on toasters, so why not a c64? the link to my repo is: https://github.com/xlar54/emudore64 i apologize for the naming - unless you dont mind. i dont really have a name for the os right now. i provided a link back to your repo and providing full credit to you for the emulation. let me know what you think, and thank you.
