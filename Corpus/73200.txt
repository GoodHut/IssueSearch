 URL : "https://github.com/CLIxIndia-Dev/open-story-tool/issues/3" TITLE : constructing json string BODY : in slideshowapp.es6.js , lines 1191-1233, you construct a json string, slidesjson , manually. while i'm impressed that works, it also seems a bit complex / brittle....i think it would be more robust if you constructed slidesjson as an object, and then ran it through json.stringify https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/javascript/reference/global_objects/json/stringify .
