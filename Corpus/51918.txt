 URL : "https://github.com/egdelwonk/nashdev-jobs/issues/25" TITLE : bug: mobile navigation BODY : the header on mobile is cut off. the css and most of this stuff, really was live coded at a meetup one night at nashjs, so it's not really the best in the world. would be nice to clean it up a bit and make sure the header and all parts of the site are visible and navigable on mobile / tablet sizes.
