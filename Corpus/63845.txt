 URL : "https://github.com/sourcelair/xterm.js/issues/898" TITLE : explicitly create types BODY : recently on the v3 branch i turned on declaration : true . this generates typings for all objects which isn't really what we want. i also notice that it doesn't declare it as a module declare module xterm which might cause problems. i suggest we handcraft these typings, this will also be a good way of enforcing what is in the public api and what is not.
