 URL : "https://github.com/gogradle/gogradle/issues/176" TITLE : cannot find package error BODY : hi, i have a repository that i'm trying to convert to gradle based build by using gogradle plugin. i already defined all the dependencies in build.gradle file. but, when i run gradlew build i'm getting a lot of the following errors about package not found: driver.go:17:2: cannot find package github.com/shopify/sarama in any of: /users/amimas/.gradle/go/binary/1.8.1/go/src/github.com/shopify/sarama from $goroot /users/amimas/gitprojects/poc/golang-project/.gogradle/project_gopath/src/github.com/shopify/sarama from $gopath driver.go:18:2: cannot find package github.com/sirupsen/logrus in any of: /users/amimas/.gradle/go/binary/1.8.1/go/src/github.com/sirupsen/logrus from $goroot /users/amimas/gitprojects/poc/golang-project/.gogradle/project_gopath/src/github.com/sirupsen/logrus from $gopath i know those dependencies are being pulled. i can see them in the vendor directory at the root of the repository, but the error messages above indicates it is not looking at the vendor directory. did i miss any configurations? here's the snippet of the driver.go file. package main import context encoding/binary encoding/json fmt io github.com/shopify/sarama github.com/sirupsen/logrus here's what the build.gradle looks like: dependencies { golang { build 'github.com/shopify/sarama@v1.13.0' build 'github.com/sirupsen/logrus@v1.0.3' } } golang { packagepath = 'amimas/golang-project' goversion = '1.8.1' } build { targetplatform = 'linux-amd64' go 'build -o .gogradle/golang-project --ldflags -extldflags -static . amimas/golang-project' }
