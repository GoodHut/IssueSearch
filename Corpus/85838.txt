 URL : "https://github.com/ethereum/cbc-casper/issues/112" TITLE : formalize release process BODY : issue currently, we merge all prs into master. this means some onlooker/potential contributor might stumble upon the code base while it's in the middle of a transition process. proposed implementation - create a develop branch to which all prs should be merged into - decide on a release schedule for merging develop into master possible options include: 1. merging into master at major, stable milestones e.g. network refactor, testing language refactor, etc 2. consistent releases with some time interval, where all features that are stable by this time are merged into master.
