BODY : i installed moment@2.18.1 and was looking through the locales available. i assumed there was an en-in locale. upon further inspection, i only saw these en locales: en-au en-ca en-gb en-ie en-nz am i missing something? just for an example for 'en-in', 'l' date-format should give 'dd/mm/yyyy' but it's giving 'mm/dd/yyyy', may be the default one. if there was a file for 'en-in', it would have been there in longdateformat. please suggest. i'am using it like this - var formatteddate = moment dateinput .locale locale .tz timezone .format momentformat ; e.g. var formatteddate = moment 1497260107000 .locale en-in .tz asia/calcutta .format l lt ; above expression gives me result in mm/dd/yyyy h:mm am/pm format where i was expecting in dd/mm/yyyy h:mm am/pm where it's giving correct result for 'en-gb' or 'en-au' because corresponding locale files are available.
