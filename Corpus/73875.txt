 URL : "https://github.com/TravisS25/Raspberry-Pi-Server/issues/1" TITLE : device set miscalculated BODY : right now there seems to be a bug where when we shut off a device, create a new set for device and then turn back on the device, the device set is randomly calculated instead of just simply adding by 1. i believe the problem is that i allow for a device to to start new set when it is also on and so when the server switches back to recording, the device reads from the server that a new set is activated before the server can change to a non set
