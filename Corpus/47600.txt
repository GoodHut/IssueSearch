BODY : issue type: bug report my rundeck detail rundeck version: 2.7.2-1 install type: deb os name/version: debian jessie we've been experiencing memory issues with rundeck, at first the thought was to increase the memory settings to 4gb but it ends up consuming also the full 4gb, gc goes mad and we basically need to restart rundeck happens once a week or so . i don't think throwing more memory to it is the solution. i've been monitoring the jvm to see what happens and it seems to me that there's some kind of memory leak, as the gc is only able to reclaim less and less memory every time it runs until it just can't do anything and rundeck goes nuts. how can we help you debug the issue? <img width= 630 alt= screen shot 2017-02-20 at 00 32 42 src= https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/825021/23107804/21d5a3f4-f704-11e6-91cc-634428b604c8.png > <img width= 688 alt= screen shot 2017-02-20 at 00 34 14 src= https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/825021/23107815/575d93b0-f704-11e6-8c1c-975118819e03.png >
