 URL : "https://github.com/joshuawhite929/spmia_feedback/issues/189" TITLE : running the code examples BODY : john, the code doesn't run without modification in this chapter. i suspect its because papertrail needs to be configured. in the logs, the organization, licensing and zulu instances complain with the following log message: nc: getaddrinfo: name does not resolve i will verify that this is the case. the challenge here is that early in the chapter see figure 9.1 , you encourage the reader to test things out. can you consider adding a comment of some kind to indicate that papertrail needs to be configured to get this to work?
