 URL : "https://github.com/jabstone/JABtalk/issues/3" TITLE : backup to google drive BODY : would be great if it would be possible to perform backup to google drive directly. use case: my kid uses two tablets. one is used by him in school driven by speech tutor in school , while the other is used at home. both tablets are set up using his own google id. would be good, if we and the teacher could backup our jabtalk settings via drive, to basically _share_ words, images, sounds we have. note: while currently it is possible to do this, for non-technical persons like the teacher is , it is a bit cumbersome: backup, upload it using google drive on tablet, then download it to device via drive, and restore.
