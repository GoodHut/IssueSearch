 URL : "https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/ts-desktop/issues/993" TITLE : fix door43 client bugs BODY : there have been a few issues in the door43 client. it is currently uncertain whether this is a bug in the client or just bad content from the api which the client should potentially handle . psalms: the chunk markers are now showing chapters padded to 3 characters e.g. 001 so they don't match up to questions correctly. also the config.yml only shows words for chapter 119. the words listed for each chunk are listed alphabetically, but on the server they have them in order that they appear in chunks. there are notes that go along with the title chunks for books and chapters in the api. however these notes are not shown in the resource containerss.
