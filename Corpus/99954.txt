 URL : "https://github.com/gunar/sam-redux/issues/3" TITLE : not reall an issue but.... BODY : how do you feel this project worked out? i am 6 months in to a build using react/redux and i want to introduce some kind of state-machine control state architecture and sam seems very interesting to me, i'm not really in the position to tear out all the redux but could fairly easily refactor to this.
