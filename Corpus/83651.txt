 URL : "https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1256" TITLE : check for bad connections BODY : there is currently no portable way to tell whether a database connection is still usable. yes, queries might return an error , but you can't easily tell from that whether it was just something with the query or database, or the connection. also, when using connection pooling, you want to know when a connection is returned to the pool whether to retire it or not. this would require just querying the connection without knowing anything about its history. i suggest adding an fn is_usable to trait connection or similar. in postgres, this can be implemented with pqstatus . mysql hopefully has something similar.
