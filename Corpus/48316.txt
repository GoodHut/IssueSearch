 URL : "https://github.com/arcosuc3m/grppi/issues/213" TITLE : revise stencil design BODY : issues: 1.- currently the transofrmer in a stencil takes as a first argument an iterator to the data to be transformed. form consistency with map and other patterns we should consider that it takes the date item and not an iterator to data item. 2.- neighbourhood function returns a collection of neighbours, which implies copies that we should be able to avoid. there are several design options here: a make that the transformer takes an iterator to an element and a neighbourhood function and that it internally obtains the list of neighbours. this is agains 1 but simplifies things a lot. b make that the transformer takes a number of data items satisfying 1 and the make neighborhood function to return a sequence of iterators to neighbours.
