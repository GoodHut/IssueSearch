 URL : "https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-library/issues/1355" TITLE : footprint pad numbering BODY : many footprints require non-standard naming for certain pins, beyond 1,2,3,4,...,n. examples: packages with thermal pads connectors with shield pins multi-throw switches with common terminals currently this is handled by adding an extra number to the pads. e.g. a 48-pin housing with an e-pad connection has pin 49 added. should we develop a standard nomenclature for these extra pads, as we can use more than just numerical identifiers for pads? examples: 1. e-pad connections could be marked ep , ep1 , ep2 etc 1. shield / gnd pins could be labelled shld , gnd , etc. 1. common pins on switches could be labelled c or com this will bring a greater level of consistency to the library. however we would need to develop a scheme that is extensible. a does anyone have any information on whether this level of naming is specified under ipc standards? b comments? objections? @jkriege2 @poeschlr @pointhi @easyw @evanshultz et al :
