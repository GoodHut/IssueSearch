BODY : hello, would you consider changing you licence to be compatible with ponyorm which is using apache 2.0? https://docs.ponyorm.com/ : starting with the version 0.7, pony orm is released under the apache license, version 2.0. i was about to use your library in a work project and make some contributions back with improvements but just saw it's listed as gplv3+ in setup.py, meaning i can't use it in our codebase. cheers, andrew
