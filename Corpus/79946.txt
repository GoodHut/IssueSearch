 URL : "https://github.com/indigo-dc/onedock/issues/67" TITLE : support for opennebula 5 BODY : hello, l'm trying to generate a vagrant image based on the one already provided but updated to ubuntu xenial and docker 1.13 with criu in order to develop the migration functionality. the work done so far is in the migration branch in this same repository. opennebula and docker seem to install just fine but not onedock. when doing a vagrant up, the following messages appear at the end of the process: ==> default: cloning into 'onedock'... ==> default: failed to open tcp connection to localhost:2633 connection refused - connect 2 for localhost port 2633 ==> default: opennebula datastore name not found, use the id instead ==> default: option datastore: parsing error ==> default: failed to open tcp connection to localhost:2633 connection refused - connect 2 for localhost port 2633 ==> default: invalid option: -n ==> default: user and password for oneadmin user: however, doing vagrant ssh works and i can execute commands correctly. i've seen that the oned.conf file has been updated as expected but the onedock datastore is not present so i've tried to add it manually to find this error: oneadmin@ubuntu-xenial:~$ cat > onedock.ds << eof > name=onedock > ds_mad=onedock > tm_mad=onedock > eof oneadmin@ubuntu-xenial:~$ onedatastore create onedock.ds datastoreallocate ds_mad named onedock is not defined in oned.conf could you please have a look at it and guide me about what's missing, please? thank you best regards.
