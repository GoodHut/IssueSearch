 URL : "https://github.com/bilalakil/brunch-map/issues/4" TITLE : multiple, share-able maps BODY : 1. users should be able to create and view individual maps, instead of having only one global map. 2. entries should be able to belong to one or more maps. 3. users should be able to share maps on a read-only basis to other users, who must be able to view them obviously . it's necessary to have multiple maps because, for instance, a user may want to share some entries with some people, other entries with other people, and also some entries with nobody at all. i think it's also necessary to have individual entries belong to multiple maps if desired , i.e. to travel, brunch and public?
