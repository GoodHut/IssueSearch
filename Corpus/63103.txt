 URL : "https://github.com/wp-cli/ideas/issues/24" TITLE : delete generated images BODY : the uploads directory can get quite large with all the different sizes of images that are generated. i've taken to using plugins that bypass all that and only generate the ones that are referenced, so i'd like a command to delete all of the generated images to save space and smaller backups for older sites. it could be useful for when you want to change your image sizes also, although there are plugins that do that and even fix the references to the images to the new size names.
