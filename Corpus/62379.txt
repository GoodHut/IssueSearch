 URL : "https://github.com/Arcana/node-dota2/issues/550" TITLE : clear profilecard cache BODY : i noticed that when using requestprofilecard a cache is created is it true? and the information of that player will be outdated only for that specific steam user that requested it on the first time, while when requesting with another steam account or a service like dotabuff the information will be more precise. there is a way to clear this kind of cache?
