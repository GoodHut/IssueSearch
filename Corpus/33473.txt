 URL : "https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/issues/199" TITLE : add react 16 support BODY : do you want to request a feature or report a bug ? react-transition-group provides support for react v^15.0.0 . react 16 is expected to be released soon and can currently be tested with react 16.0.0-rc more information can be found on https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10294 . react-transition-group is a dependency in a package in the terra-core monorepo https://github.com/cerner/terra-core , which will need to be react 16 compatible. from my initial assessment of our repository, it seems focus-trap behaves as expected with react v16.0.0-rc , but confirmed testing is needed.
