 URL : "https://github.com/sandeepmistry/bleno/issues/275" TITLE : events on characteristics BODY : i notice that characteristics extend eventemitter and emit events which correspond to the methods: subscribe , readrequest etc... i would like to use this as a feature, but see that it is not a documented part of the api. in particular, i would like to do characteristic.once 'subscribe', setuplistenertoprovideupdates , so that i can set up this listener only once, and wait until there is a subscriber who wants the information it provides before setting it up. do you expect this usage would be stable? thanks @sandeepmistry for the great module!
