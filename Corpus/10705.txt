 URL : "https://github.com/danieltj27/Dark-Mode/issues/30" TITLE : darm mode dreams BODY : hi, while i can see the plugin is still in it's baby shoes i have some ideas/notes/questions: will this be playing nicely in combination with user color schemes? will it override it or somehow combine? would be nice to be able to set a time schedule for de/enabling the dark mode and if you allow me to dream more, this could even be available as an automatic mode, checking the user's time zone or even sunset time query? when dark mode gets enabled, it should fade in, not switch from white to dark instantly.. maybe having -not so dark- mode first, 1h later full darkness ps: while developing, it would be helpful to have the darkmode.css file uncompressed
