 URL : "https://github.com/schrum2/MM-NEATv2/issues/416" TITLE : fix vizdoom substrates BODY : the reason that vizdoom runs were crashing was because of errors made when the vizdoom substrates were generalized. specifically, the output substrates are constructed incorrectly, in that they have the wrong sizes. i'll be making a commit soon that fixes the defend-the-center task, but you will need to fix all of the rest: launch each batch file to make sure it runs without crashing before closing this issue.
