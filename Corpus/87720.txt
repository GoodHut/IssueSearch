 URL : "https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist/issues/472" TITLE : make logging customizable BODY : right now styleguidist uses console.log  to show some potentially useful messages like: no webpack config found. you may need to specify webpackconfig option in your style guide config: https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist/blob/master/docs/webpack.md we should do it only when styleguidist is started from cli, not from the api or tests . would be nice to be able to customize the logging somehow — i don’t really know what would be the right approach — maybe pass a logging function ~~everywhere~~ or something like that.
