 URL : "https://github.com/dehli/TouchDraw/issues/28" TITLE : auto layout update BODY : when i trigger an orientation change, the touchdrawview acts weird. when rotating back to the original orientation, everything works as expected again. i haven't found a way to adjust to a new view size. maybe i'm just missing something. if not, it would be great to have a function which allows to resize dynamically. thx!
