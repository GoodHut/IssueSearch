 URL : "https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk-script/issues/2186" TITLE : coldstart logging issue BODY : some host level logs aren't logged when the runtime is cold starting. e.g. the admin/host/log endpoint. to repro, cause the runtime to coldstart before invoking this log endpoint. i suspect that the issue is that these controllers are being created with a noop tracewriter their ctor argument because the di container only returns a valid tracewriter when the runtime host instance is not null. otherwise it returns a nulltracewriter. that's what i think the issue is. need to check other controllers as well, like keyscontroller.
