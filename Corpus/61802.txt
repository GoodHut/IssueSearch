 URL : "https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android/issues/161" TITLE : browser compatibility ? BODY : i've implemented authentication in an app and in the simulator all works great. however when i tried it on a device samsung s6 it got stuck redirecting back to the app from the browser authentication - the redirect intent never reached the app. with some experimentation i got it working by whitelisting browsers to just chrome_browser, firefox_browser and samsung_browser so blacklisting the _custom_tab browsers . can someone explain what the issue is and whether limiting like this is going to cause any issues on devices without these browsers? anything else i should be doing? thanks...
