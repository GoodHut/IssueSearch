 URL : "https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/issues/387" TITLE : default image on py3.6? BODY : i see that @willingc bumped the python version in doc/env.yml to 3.6 yay! , but i was just testing @choldgraf's binder-stats notebook and, despite its own reqs.txt not pinning the python version, i get a 3.5. is the default image a 3.5, or is this an artifact of an old build? i think we should be promoting 3.6 throughout for now, f-strings and pathlib are too nice to miss :
