 URL : "https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/3158" TITLE : <img> element state BODY : text around the img element sometimes talks about the img element being in a state. however, the states are only defined for an image request , two of which can be associated with an img element. presumably this needs to refer to the img element's current request's state, but it would be good to have that confirmed by @zcorpan.
