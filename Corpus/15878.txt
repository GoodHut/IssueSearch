 URL : "https://github.com/bentonstark/starksoft-aspen/issues/27" TITLE : ftps with tls 1.2 BODY : hello, while testing this library against a bunch of ftp servers to see if i could use it for a project at work to replace ftpwebrequest, i encountered a server that it refused to connect to. the reason was that the server was only allowing tls 1.2 connections. the sslstream class that you're using supports tls 1.2, but that wasn't added until .net 4.5 and your code here appears to target .net 4.0. i updated the code locally to .net 4.5 and confirmed that switching sslprotocols.tls to sslprotocols.tls12 allowed the server in question to connect successfully. i basically just replaced the existing tls option with tls12 since it's backwards compatible anyway. i've created a fork with the changes i'll be using. would you like a pull request for the .net 4.5 update and the tls upgrade? i see that you considered a .net 4.5 upgrade to be a downside in a previous issue, so i'm not sure if you want this yet. tls changes are this commit: https://github.com/sappharad/starksoft-aspen/commit/9d2d3c918eb02c2ea3ef8fda8c707126b01ef89d .net upgrade is the prior commit, unit tests the following one thanks!
