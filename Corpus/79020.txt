 URL : "https://github.com/nuxt-community/nuxtent/issues/14" TITLE : resolve async components BODY : using async components inside loaders is exhibiting weird, inconsistent behavior. this method only works if the project is in the same directory as nuxt root. 1. components { somecomponent: => import '~components/somecomponent' } this method works even if the directory is not the same as nuxt root, but it's not async. 2. components { somecomponent: require ~components/${name + ext} } and of course, even though the first method worked in the same directory as the package, when i tried to test it externally, it didn't work. only this third approach worked. 3. components { somecomponent: resolve => require ~components/${name + ext} , resolve } but the third approach failed when i tried to run nuxt generate ... error in nuxt.bundle.3107bd9208454be22be2.js from uglifyjs unexpected token: punc nuxt.bundle.3107bd9208454be22be2.js:1191,4 hmm.. only the standard approach so far works in all situations: 4. import somecomponent from '~component/somecomponent' export default { components: { somecomponet } } not sure if this is an issue with nuxt, with vue loader, or with the usage of dynamic imports inside loaders. going to stick the fourth approach in the meantime.
