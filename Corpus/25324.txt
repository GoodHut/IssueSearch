 URL : "https://github.com/dockcross/dockcross/issues/181" TITLE : windows image size BODY : dear matt mccormick, any reason why https://github.com/dockcross/dockcross/blob/master/windows-x64/dockerfile l57-l66 similar for windowx-x86 is missing the install command and compilers are used directly from the src directory, wasting extra space? would it still work if mxe is installed even if not under default prefix or it would conflict with gcc? thank you!
