 URL : "https://github.com/psi-4ward/psitransfer/issues/7" TITLE : how to delete a file? BODY : hello, i was testing a few things in psitransfer but i'm having issues with deleting files. when a user uploads a new file if generates a 12 character string and a folder with that string is created inside the data folder. i deleted that folder but the link is still valid and there you can see some metadata like the file name, size, etc. the file doesn't exists and can't be previewed or downloaded but the trail is there. is there a proper way to delete uploads or am i missing something?
