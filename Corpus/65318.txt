 URL : "https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta/issues/271" TITLE : incremental load attack BODY : do you think that would be useful to have a couple of more options for increasing the rate over time? this will prevent bursts and would be good to test auto scalable apps in wider period of time. what i propose is two more options like inc-rate and inc-time ; to increment rate on every inc-time . vegeta attack -duration=600s -rate=1000 -inc-rate=20% -inc-time=30s
