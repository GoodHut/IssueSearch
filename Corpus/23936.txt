 URL : "https://github.com/chainer/chainer/issues/3387" TITLE : revisit link tests BODY : many builtin links are simple wrappers for corresponding functions. in order to test such link, it should be enough to check whether the underlying function is called with correct arguments. however, currently, the same checks as the corresponding functions are being done in link tests. for example, links_tests/connection_tests/test_linear checks whether forward/backward computations are correct, while the same checks are done in functions_tests/connection_tests/test_linear . those are duplicated checks which are waste of not only computational resource, but also implementation cost.
