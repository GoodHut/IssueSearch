 URL : "https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-kubernetes/issues/243" TITLE : add rbac support BODY : _from @sabbyanandan on november 13, 2017 19:4_ as a developer, i'd like to study the applicability of rbac support in the deployer implementation, so we can prepare for k8s 1.8.x compatibility. notes: - 1.8.x release http://blog.kubernetes.io/2017/09/kubernetes-18-security-workloads-and.html supports rbac and if it is enabled, the deployer implementation requires a serviceaccount and a role to gain access to k8s apis - we would still have to identify the fabric8 client that's compatible with 1.8.x 2.5.9 appears to be a good candidate - the goal of this spike is to study the applicability of rbac and the deployer specific support for it _copied from original issue: spring-cloud/spring-cloud-deployer-kubernetes 162_
