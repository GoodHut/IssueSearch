 URL : "https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/issues/6229" TITLE : add new for treeselect BODY : what problem does this feature solve? allows user to use new values using treeselect . i think this would be a big enhancement for an already great project. what does the proposed api look like? instead of not found , it would allow the user to create a new value in the tree. it could go under a generic 'none' heading, or even better, it could be added under a node of choice. screenshot provided. ! screen shot 2017-05-23 at 1 16 55 pm https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13043067/26337174/488e6888-3fba-11e7-91cf-e2993812c5a8.jpg <!-- generated by ant-design-issue-helper. do not remove -->
