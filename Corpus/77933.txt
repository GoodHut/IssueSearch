 URL : "https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5/issues/183" TITLE : oskernellock and osdelay BODY : hi, i want to make a delay inside a os critical section in rtos2. when i lock the kernel, the tick count doesn't stop and i try an osdelay but it fails. i know that the task switches are lock and then the idle thread doesn't go to running state while my thread is waiting, but the return of osdelay is osok. it is correct? i try the next solution: uint32_t tick_time = oskernelgettickcount ; while oskernelgettickcount < tick_time + 500 {} i think that it is a good workaround if i supose that the tick doesn't overflow
