 URL : "https://github.com/eclipse/january/issues/169" TITLE : remove dependency on eavp BODY : there are a few classes still depending on eavp in the forms branch. 1 geometrycomponent- eavp classes are present but no longer used and can be removed. 2 resourcehandler- iterates over all found ivizservices from the ivizservicefactory to decide whether a file should be used in an iceresource or a vizresource. vizresource extends iceresource, and i don't see anything that would break form having resourcehandler always return a vizresource and ignoring the extra data members provided by the subclass. 3 meshcomponent- this is the biggest one. for compressed xml persistence, it uses several old data structures the basiccontroller mvc classes that used to represent data objects from eavp that are slated for deletion and replacement with new january classes similar to how the eavp geometry classes depend on the january geometry classes, though this is a large undertaking and improvements to the mesh editor like that aren't a current priority. we may just need to move o.e.eavp.modeling into january from now until the time it's removed entirely.
