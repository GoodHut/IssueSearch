 URL : "https://github.com/NuGet/Client.Engineering/issues/1" TITLE : merge core projects BODY : merge core projects together •	nuget.client single file that drives nuget.contentmodel o	merge into nuget.packaging •	nuget.protocol.core.types, nuget.protocol.core.v3, nuget.protocol.visualstudio, nuget.repositories o	merge all four projects into a single nuget.protocol project •	nuget.packaging.core.types o	merge into nuget.packaging.core •	nuget.packaging o	add dependencies on nuget.contentmodel and nuget.runtimemodel. currently packaging only supports reading assets for packages.config, but it should move towards handling everything •	nuget.dependencyresolver.core o	rename to nuget.dependencyresolver •	test helper projects there are at least 5 o	these should all be merged into two projects. one for core and one for desktop. the desktop project will depend on the core project and will be the super set. o	test projects will depend on all product code and be high level. this will eliminate the need for having a test helper project for every project. examples of unnecessary projects: nuget.dependencyresolver.core.tests.utility, nuget.commands.test.utility
