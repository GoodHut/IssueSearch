 URL : "https://github.com/capitalcubing/ccweb/issues/5" TITLE : smoothen nav collapse BODY : on mobile devices, nav bar collapse used to immediately make its width decrease and that looked weird. now we have reduced the transition time so users can't see the decreased width in 0.01 second. however, we ideally want width to not decrease and collapse animation to be slower say 0.35 second
