 URL : "https://github.com/dswalker/csu-central-package/issues/4" TITLE : pager not working BODY : the tool tip on the pager is blocking the buttons on the pager. the tooltip is attempting to pop up on the right under the assumption the pager is on the left but unable to do so as it hits the right edge of the page, and so ends up covering the pager elements themselves, preventing the mouse pointer from being able to click the actual buttons.
