 URL : "https://github.com/f4exb/picc1101/issues/3" TITLE : race in radio.c BODY : hey there, the following line in radio.c seems to be problematic: int_line = digitalread wpi_gdo0 ; // sense interrupt line to determine if it was a raising or falling edge i sometimes get two rising edge interrupts at once. obviously this results in errors. i was able to solve the problem by waiting a millisecond before reading wpi_gdo0 which is obviously an evil hack. how could this be implemented reliably?
