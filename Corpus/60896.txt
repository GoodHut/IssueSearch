 URL : "https://github.com/spacetelescope/nircam_simulator/issues/25" TITLE : add persistence effects BODY : add a method that takes a yaml input parameter file and outputs a traps filled file. this way a user can specify a random scene, create a persistence map from it, and then use that as input for their own observations. then you just need to modify kevinâ€™s function to calculate persistence in an observation given the initial traps filled file.
