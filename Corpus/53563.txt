 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/reactxp/issues/167" TITLE : electron not supported BODY : hi all, i'm currently trying to create an electron version of my reactxp app deployment target: a windows 7 compliant app and i have a referenceerror: window is not defined thrown by the import of ~/reactxp/dist/web/app.js . i use webpack to bundle my app, so it's executed via an eval command from inside the bundle. the problem seems to be caused by this line: https://github.com/microsoft/reactxp/blob/master/src/web/app.ts l47 i do want to contribute but i'm wondering about the best way to deal with this issue: should i try to declare an empty global object named window or should i try to track every usage of this global object which doesn't exist within electron as it runs a node.js server to eliminate those one by one? i think choosing the second way is much cleaner but i wonder if i'm not going to break things in the process, thinking of the line of code above, i don't know how this is used accross the whole lib! any thought?
