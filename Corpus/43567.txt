 URL : "https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/IOS-nRF-Toolbox/issues/35" TITLE : cryptic error message BODY : we wasted a valuable time trying to understand the reason of a issue we were having with ota. we were using nrf51 sdk 11 which support only legacy ota. nordic documentation didn't specify anything about a specific version of nrfjprog , but we learn via amazing nordic support that we needed to use nrfutil <= 0.5.2 https://github.com/nordicsemiconductor/pc-nrfutil/tree/v0.5.2 in order to generate a legacy compatible package. i'm not sure if the error code return by the app match any other similar issue but we get operation failed. ensure the firmware targets that device type and version. i.e..: https://github.com/nordicsemiconductor/ios-nrf-toolbox/blob/0aae864a1ce0d34ac7f3cd589625d353f552d9be/pods/iosdfulibrary/iosdfulibrary/classes/implementation/legacydfu/services/legacydfuservice.swift l293 which is pretty cryptic. it would have been awesome to have something like: this package version doesn't seem to be supported by your current boot loader sdk version. please consider upgrading your sdk or use the correct firmware packaging format, see docs xxx for more help thank you for your help and support, we know it's hard to maintain past documentation but i think legacy ota even if unsecure is still pretty widely used for device which don't need this security. thanks and hope it helps others :
