 URL : "https://github.com/jimhester/note/issues/1" TITLE : musicmaker and suggestions BODY : you might want to consider a slightly different interface. right now you only have a single octave covered it looks like. i made a package to make music a long time ago https://github.com/dasonk/musicmaker and the way i got around this issue was specify the octave along with the note. i also just accepted strings for the notes and then converted the entire vector at one time to avoid calling a note creation function every time. you might consider doing something similar - or at least providing an example in your readme on how to more easily do that. anyways the package looks promising. when i'm not on my phone i'll try to check it out a bit more thoroughly.
