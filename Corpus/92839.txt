 URL : "https://github.com/JuliaStats/StatsBase.jl/issues/311" TITLE : a more performant countmap BODY : a faster implementation of countmap exists in fastgroupby.jl https://github.com/xiaodaigh/fastgroupby.jl in the form of sumby that uses radixsort instead of a dictionary method. it can be made to return a dictionary though. happy to make a pr that require no dependencies. see this companion post https://www.codementor.io/zhuojiadai/an-empirical-study-of-group-by-strategies-in-julia-dagnosell for the research backing the faster claim.
