 URL : "https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/10112" TITLE : support for yubikey BODY : feature suggestion: integrate support for yubikey in the wallet. implement the possibility to use a yubikey to either authenticate transactions or decrypt the wallet. i think that one of the hindrances of people using the core wallet, and thereby running a full node, is the lack of security features. if i could, i would implement it myself, but i don't have skills to do so.
