BODY : i love your nes emulator, great effort! i noticed you added mmc3 mapper so i immediately tried out smb3 and it seemed to work perfectly ... at first. after a min or so of play it gets corrupted. i myself am writing a nes emulator to learn rust and had a look at your code to compare to my implementation and noticed you don't separate your read/write calls by chr/prg. i think that could be where the corruption is coming from. data is 'leaking' across to the chr address space. top game is contra force, it starts out fine then after a minute or so it corrupts. same thing with smb3. in other emulators higan, sprocketnes, bizhawk prg and chr are separate. let me know what you think. ! untitled https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1308317/31644016-b7dcdd44-b2c1-11e7-90ab-7eef8b0084b7.png ! untitled2 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1308317/31644078-225445fe-b2c2-11e7-96ac-2e5bf5ec0a61.png
