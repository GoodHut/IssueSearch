 URL : "https://github.com/jaypipes/gsr/issues/3" TITLE : allow configurable logging BODY : now that we no longer use the global log setup and instead have a registrylogs struct that we can hang loggers off, we should add some configurability around logging. i'm thinking something like this: gsr_log_mode environment variable would be a string like ldate | ltime | lshortfile that would allow the user to enable a particular log record format and align gsr's logging with their own application's needs/expectations.
