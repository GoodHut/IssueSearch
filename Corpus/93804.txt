 URL : "https://github.com/snac-cooperative/snac/issues/23" TITLE : ark manager mint real arks BODY : in gitlab by @deternitydx on sep 15, 2016, 12:55 the ark manager currently mints temporary arks only. it should be updated with the functionality to request from postgres a real ark. what happens when an ark is unavailable from the real ark list? what is the process for adding more arks to the postgres database? do we want to eventually update the ark manager to directly query cdl for a new ark?
