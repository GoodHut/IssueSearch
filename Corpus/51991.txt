 URL : "https://github.com/valderman/selda/issues/48" TITLE : caching with triggers? BODY : disclaimer: i do not use selda, just evaluate second-level cache solutions for postgres. docs states that selda keeps track of changes and evicts cache on quesries. but what if there is a trigger which updates/inserts/deletes some tables in the same transaction? would selda know about that changes?
