 URL : "https://github.com/rroemhild/docker-ejabberd/issues/124" TITLE : crash without hostname BODY : hi tried the docker-compose example but got ... ejabberd_1 | 00:50:27.220 info reusing listening port for {5280,{0,0,0,0},tcp} ejabberd_1 | 00:50:27.220 info reusing listening port for {5443,{0,0,0,0},tcp} ejabberd_1 | 00:50:27.220 info ejabberd 16.09 is started in the node 'ejabberd@...' ejabberd_1 | 00:50:27.220 info application ejabberd started on node 'ejabberd@...' ejabberd_ejabberd_1 exited with code 1 after ~30 seconds. adding hostname to the service resolves the problem.
