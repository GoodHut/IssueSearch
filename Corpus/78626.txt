 URL : "https://github.com/resin-io-modules/network_manager/issues/66" TITLE : quicker travis ci builds BODY : in a previous commit i added a --force option to cargo install rustfmt , since there was a problem with travis updating rustfmt to latest version. forcing the rustfmt build slowed down consecutive travis builds considerably, since it breaks cargo caching, and needs to be removed. if such an error pops up in a future rustfmt update i will investigate in more details.
