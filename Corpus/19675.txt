 URL : "https://github.com/Misfittech/nano_stepper/issues/8" TITLE : add rs485 & modbus BODY : hello, the nano_stepper is using tx&rx, so we have to use a main controller like arduino mega 2560 , which owns 3or4 serials ports. if we add rs485&modbus into nano_stepper, we could use “daisy chaining”, just 1 serial port in main controller, or one computer could control many servo motors. how about the idea？ i will make it in my free time. thank you!
