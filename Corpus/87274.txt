 URL : "https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-java/issues/2401" TITLE : jul logginghandler issues BODY : there are a couple of issues in the com.google.cloud.logging.logginghandler - unused private methods: getlogginghandlers , haslogginghandler - assigning the handler to a specific logger, rather than the root, doesn't work. com.example.handlers=com.google.cloud.logging.logginghandler the second one needs to be investigated a bit more. @jabubake fyi
