 URL : "https://github.com/csiqueirasilva/PoEController/issues/14" TITLE : does not work BODY : it launches steam poe and displays the overlay properly, but moving the sticks does nothing, and pressing buttons on the controller does nothing. even after logging in and choosing a character and getting into the game proper, no input from the controller reaches the game. also i notice there's no mapping for t. i downloaded the source to poke it, but i don't have any clue how to compile it, and there don't appear to be any compiling instructions.
