BODY : @leont would you know how to adjust verbosity of the output? i see there's this enum, which suggests it's possible, but i'm having trouble finding the user-facing knob to turn to achive these volumes: perl6 enum formatter::volume <silent reallyquiet quiet normal verbose>; trying to make output verbose , like prove -v so all the test details get printed.
