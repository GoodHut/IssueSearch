 URL : "https://github.com/mrmin123/kancolle-auto/issues/354" TITLE : class-specific bucket use? BODY : this is a thought that just popped into my mind while doing some event-prep training. what kind of workflow would be required to place conditions on the bucket-use-timer? as a use case, say i want to set my script to use buckets on any of my main ships if repairs exceed an hour, but for my sub tank i never want to use my bucket set to 99 hours, etc.
