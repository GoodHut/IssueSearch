 URL : "https://github.com/inkel/cmd2slack/issues/2" TITLE : usage with pipes BODY : the idea is being able to do something like command | cmd2slack -hook … . i'm not sure how much worthy could be, but if it doesn't prove to be too difficult to implement, i might give it a shot. another option is adding a -tee flag that behaves similar to the tee 1 http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tee.1.html command, allowing to do something like command | cmd2slack -hook … | command2 . this one could prove more difficult, perhaps.
