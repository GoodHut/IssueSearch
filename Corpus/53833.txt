BODY : awesome text, thanks a lot for putting this online, even if you consider it a draft. since you mention both the repeat system and hydras... any chance you know how to get those to play well together? e.g. i have , c comma followed by c bound to a hydra i use comma as my leader key , but pressing . to repeat the hydra command after use does not work. emacs evil-declare-repeat 'my-hydra/body ;; this does not work
