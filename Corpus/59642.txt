 URL : "https://github.com/jfbercher/jupyter_latex_envs/issues/25" TITLE : update to notebook 5.0 BODY : hey, cool package, really interested for use with my https://chrisjsewell.github.io/ipypublish/ however i notice that its compatibiilty specification in the yaml is only set to notebook 4.0. when i tested it out on a notebook 5.0 via nbextensions its been a little buggy in terms of resolving reference links getting some ?? and citations: 1. i have and @online citation which doesn't resolve 2. i have an @article that resolves as kirkeminde and ren, undefined and i'm not sure what the undefined is meant to be 3. the reference section says it can't find the bibliography despite it resolving the above citation not sure if this is related to the version change? cheers
