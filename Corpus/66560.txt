 URL : "https://github.com/WildBamaBoy/minecraft-comes-alive/issues/906" TITLE : my children are do-less BODY : i started a new world with myself married to a guy, with no children. so, to populate the village, i started having children! however, none of my children had assigned 'jobs' after growing up; i can't hire them to do anything. i.e. nothing appears under the 'special' menu . i had a whole bunch of kids, finally one of my grandchildren was born as a cleric and i was able to use the cleric commands with that one after it grew up . do i need to wait for grandchildren and great-grandchildren to have hire-able villagers, or is this a bug?
