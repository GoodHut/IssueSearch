 URL : "https://github.com/USGS-VIZLAB/vizstorm/issues/11" TITLE : pipeline for precip BODY : import and clean up the code for precip data fetching, calculation of cumulative precip, and any other munging - ensure all precip pipeline functionality gets brought into the template. - be flexible about spatial resolution maybe even differing between mobile and desktop? - precip data has come from at least 2 different sources for us in the past. data might come from www.srh.noaa.gov/data/ridge2/precip/qpehourlyshape maria or gdp most others, e.g., https://github.com/usgs-vizlab/hurricane-harvey/blob/master/scripts/fetch/fetchprecip.r, https://github.com/usgs-vizlab/hurricane-irma/blob/master/scripts/fetch/fetchprecip_cells.r . offer both all? in this template, to be flexible about the location of future storms. - it may be possible to simplify the precip-fetching code using sf and other insights; see https://github.com/usgs-vizlab/how-gdp/blob/master/scripts/fetch/fetch_utils.r l14-l49 for our most recent iteration on this
