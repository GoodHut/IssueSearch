 URL : "https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/issues/8112" TITLE : docs hack day? BODY : been playing around with sylius for the last couple of weeks and am impressed with what it has to offer! nevertheless, the documentation seems to be way out dated. i regard myself as an experienced developer so in the end i'll find my way around, but can imagine the wrong documentation can scare off quite a bit of users. take a look at the custom calculators http://docs.sylius.org/en/latest/bundles/syliusshippingbundle/custom_calculators.html section which refers to classes which don't even exist anymore and calls for documentation repairs in the comment section of pull requests https://github.com/sylius/sylius/commit/dc84aba6e9544be0fdd135a544f248cd3d6445e7 commitcomment-21140284 with 3k+ stars and 1k+ forks, would it be an idea to organise somekind a doc hack day? quite sure if you reach out to your contributors and stars you'll find a bunch of people willing to lending a hand and make the community grow even bigger...
