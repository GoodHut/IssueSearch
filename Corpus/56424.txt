 URL : "https://github.com/crowfallgame/bugs/issues/33" TITLE : nature's avatar issues BODY : tinnis found something interesting, appears druid's nature's avatar either suffered a ninja nerf, or it is not working as intended somehow. tooltip says 75% damage modifier, the power is increasing 40% damage only and not stacking with anything else : http://i.imgur.com/daex9cr.png also when you cast nature's avatar, it doesnt create essence on channel - only a few % on initial channel cast even with no target . another issue with druid: the passives from mostaff slow burn and quick growth are not working and do not affect your essence generation. the 6 power from life tray is also not affecting essence generation empower and the other one . it's annoying since it prevents druids from being able to manage their essence more carefully. finally i had a bug last night where my soul power as a legio wouldn't charge up at all. i fought for a long time and got zero charge for my soul power. relogging seemed to fix the issue afterwards. reporter: rikutatis reference: https://community.crowfall.com/index.php?/topic/17387-playtest-feedback-for-june-15-to-june-19-2017/&page=14 comment-350942
