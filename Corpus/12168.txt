BODY : could you add a license to this project? i want to add a few fun, internal single-purpose web apps at my work. i like that this project is simple and easy to modify. the only issue is that there is no license. without a license, i am told by the legal team, that i am only allowed to view the source code. according to choosealicense.com, github's tos gives its users express permission to fork projects. however, that does not consent to-modify nor to-execute. personally, i prefer the mit license, but for work-related oss projects i use apache 2.0. https://choosealicense.com/ https://choosealicense.com/no-license/ https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/ https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/
