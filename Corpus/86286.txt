 URL : "https://github.com/matterhorn-chat/matterhorn/issues/273" TITLE : highlight edited messages BODY : right now when a message is edited, the channel highlights in the sidebar to indicate that it has unread messages, but the edited message is not visually distinguished in any way. we can fix this by using a similar logic to how we show the new messages divider: when drawing the channel and rendering messages, if the message's update timestamp is greater than the viewedprev timestamp, highlight the message in some way to indicate that it was edited. done this way, this means that then when the user returns to that same channel later, edited messages will no longer be highlighted since we only want to show those indications once per view, similar to the new messages divider.
