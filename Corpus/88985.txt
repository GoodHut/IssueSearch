 URL : "https://github.com/monicahq/monica/issues/76" TITLE : people need more metadata BODY : most people have more than one email and phone number, plus websites, twitter username. i think adding something were we have a either a table for each type of data like the email table, address table, phone number table and so on. that might not scale well so an alternative is to make a general person metadata table and have a name and value column relating to one person. the second approach isn't great database design but allows for any data to be stored about a person. i am looking forward to getting this going with a pull request or two but any wondering what everyone thinks is the better way to go
