 URL : "https://github.com/LabVIEW-DCAF/TagEditorCore/issues/341" TITLE : add tag persistence BODY : add ability to persist most recent within decimation amount value of certain critical tags. proposed approach: use sqlite library vipm://drjdpowell_lib_sqlite_labview?repo_url=http://ftp.ni.com/evaluation/labview/lvtn/vipm to expose a simple database. editor: add a column to the tags editor page that exposes a persist? checkbox. add an item to the engine settings editor page that determines persistence decimation how often to save persisted values . config: add a config item for persisted tag list to the engine runtime: at engine init, add a check for each tag for whether that tag is on the persisted list. if so, check if a persisted value exists at the predefined database location. database location/name should be tied to the engine name, imo, so we can handle multiple concurrent engines. if value exists, init tag to that value. if no persisted value exists, use the default value for that tag like we do now. at the designated decimation value of loop iterations, copy the latest value of each tag in the persisted list to the database file. it would be nice if the engine also kept the latest timestamp of the data, but that is not currently there. initial tests are promising - library already works on windows and linux, and is reasonably performant.
