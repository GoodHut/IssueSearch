 URL : "https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/issues/8412" TITLE : bug can't send a message BODY : description: i could not consistently reproduce this bug, but under certain circumstances, the enter button alone will only add a new line character in the messagebox. the icon also does not change to the send button which would allow me to send it mannualy. restarting the rocketchat client seems to fix the problem, but it's far from a permanent solution. server setup information: version of rocket.chat server: 0.58.2 operating system: ubuntu deployment method snap/docker/tar/etc : docker number of running instances: 1 expected behavior: ! send_message_bug_2 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5400332/31234612-5843d23c-a9bd-11e7-87e7-9fa8334753dc.png actual behavior: ! send_message_bug_1 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5400332/31234616-5ca8c36e-a9bd-11e7-9b7d-077f5833d5be.png
