 URL : "https://github.com/taylorflatt/go-chat/issues/7" TITLE : chunking file transfer BODY : the chat application needs to be able to implement file transfers between the members of the group. it would requite another rpc call looking something like: protobuf ...{ rpc file stream filerequest returns fileresponse ; } message filerequest { message key { string key = 1; } message chunk { bytes data = 1; int64 pos = 1; } oneof value { key key = 1; chunk chunk = 2; } } this would take a file binary as a stream and send the chunks over. implementing a buffer on the receiver would probably be a good idea. or i can simply just begin writing the chunks to disk. just need to watch for the file stream to end abruptly. also, since this will be another stream, it would open up the ability to send messages during a file transfer as well.
