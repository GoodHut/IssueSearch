 URL : "https://github.com/OpenShot/openshot-qt/issues/721" TITLE : no audio on preview BODY : operating system: windows 10 64bit openshot version: 2.3.4 when i preview a video file, i hear no sound. i've tried separating the audio track and changing the enable audio setting from -1 to 0 to 1 back to -1. once i export the file, i hear audio just fine. i need it on the preview, though. thanks!
