 URL : "https://github.com/Ralim/ts100/issues/29" TITLE : left hand display BODY : the intro icon wich shows the iron with the buttons is the wrong direction. also the time to press both buttons are very short to exit solder mode... also very useful would be a permanent charge indicator for the battery, because most people i think use it with lipos and there would be nice to have for example a bar of pixels permanently on the display wich length relates to charge.... only 3 more menu items: clow cell low ghigh cell high ccount cell count ... great firmware for a rewrite until now : üëç
