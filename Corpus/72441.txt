 URL : "https://github.com/TrueBitFoundation/interactive-coin-offerings/issues/15" TITLE : build initial test cases BODY : what is it? we need someone to build out an initial set of tests for the interactive crowdsale. problem right now, we are fairly confident with the library but we need tests to ensure that it behaves as intended. once this initial simple run through of basic functionality is completed, others can then copy the tests and make new versions that test different possible situations in the sale. solution write a set of tests to ensure basic functionality in the token sale library. steps to implement - write pre-sale tests to ensure sale is initialized correctly - during the sale, test basic bids, withdrawals, and make sure the valuation pointer is moving correctly across the buckets - after withdrawal lock, ensure bidders can't withdraw bids and that the valuation increases. - write post-sale tests to ensure the correct amount of tokens are available to withdraw, bids with personal valuations under the total valuation get full refunds, and bids with accurate personal valuations get tokens.
