 URL : "https://github.com/esfiddle/esfiddle/issues/54" TITLE : move from stylus to sass BODY : when i inherited the project the styles were written in stylus. i never knew stylus so i just wrote css in the stylus files basically. i think a lot more people are familiar with sass myself included! and so can take full advantage of the features that sass offers. a pr for this issue would include moving all our .stylus files over to sass files and configuring that in the build process including the watch task .
