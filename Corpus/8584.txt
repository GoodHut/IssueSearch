 URL : "https://github.com/RestComm/Restcomm-Connect/issues/2223" TITLE : port to node.js BODY : can you comment on viability of this option. some benefits i see to doing this: less overhead in deployment / packaging more modules to work with easy to extend functionality threading vs event loop, many java libraries are going towards the async approach instead of threading now because it just scales better that way using react / react native would ensure uniform language usage across the stack and platform compatibility for mobile and desktop, that means you can have same features on ios / android / windows mobile and web with less code to manage really good libraries for data visualization, it would be so simple implementing rvd using https://flowhub.io/ nom module available for node.js plus many more. comments are welcome.
