 URL : "https://github.com/CKIXD/Doomed-Atlantis/issues/33" TITLE : actions per turn BODY : would downtime between players be improved if each player only had one action per turn? creatures would then also get only one action per turn. maybe there are two clock cards for each adv, so there are still two actions per turn, but broken up?
