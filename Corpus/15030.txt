 URL : "https://github.com/lucasem/servemd/issues/1" TITLE : config for titles BODY : it's be nice to be able to specify titles, so not all markdown pages will have the same title. perhaps some toml, where the latest matching item is used to determine the title these would _not_ be regex, for performance reasons . if the path doesn't start with / , it is assumed. an exact match could also be specified. toml title_fallback = foo's documents titles = { path = bar , title = bar stuff }, matches /bar/, /barometer, /bar/baz, ... { path = bar , exact = true, title = bar }, matches only /bar { path = bar/about , title = about bar }, { path = projects , title = foo's projects }, this could then be loaded into the markdown template as .title : html <!doctype html> <html> <head> <title>{{ .title }}</title> </head> <body> {{ .content }} </body> </html> and of course, it would have an optional place in the config: yaml dir: path/to/docs titles: path/to/titles.toml
