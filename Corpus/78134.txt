 URL : "https://github.com/coala/docker-coala-base/issues/221" TITLE : pin python minor version BODY : we've had some 'hard to debug' breakages when versions of runtimes are updated. most recent was https://github.com/coala/docker-coala-base/issues/216 with ruby, but also https://github.com/coala/docker-coala-base/issues/182 with node not long ago. the breakages are usually because the new version is released into the repositories we are using before they are stable and other dependent packages are ready for the upgrade. python 3.6 is here for a while. if python 3.7 arrives, we can wait a while. if we wait too long, and python 3.6 disappears from the repos, it is fairly easy to debug an error 'package python3.6 cant be found', and by then switching to python 3.7 is a safe stable easy fix.
