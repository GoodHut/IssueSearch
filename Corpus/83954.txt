 URL : "https://github.com/researchstudio-sat/webofneeds/issues/1334" TITLE : configuring web-app build BODY : it would be nice, to have some way to inject configs into the build process e.g. custom scss and json-files . one way of doing this would be to give docker a path to a config-folder, that it just mounts into the owner-application folder. this doesn't change our dev-setup though, i.e. we'd need docker to test these configs. imo these build-configs should live in conf.local along with the run-configs.
