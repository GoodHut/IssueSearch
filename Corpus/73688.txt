 URL : "https://github.com/semprag/biblatex-sp-unified/issues/33" TITLE : date ranges in citations BODY : biblatex allows the .bib file to contain date ranges, which is useful among other things for items such as dictionaries and dialect atlases that come out over several years but where it doesn't really make sense to refer to the individual volumes. the date range gets correctly printed in the bibliography, but only the initial year is shown in the citation. i'm afraid i failed to understand how date printing works : . here's an mwe meant to run with xelatex : latex \begin{filecontents }{\jobname.bib} @mvbook{sgds, editor = {รณ dochartaigh, cathair}, title = {survey of the {gaelic} dialects of {scotland}}, location = {dublin}, publisher = {dublin institute for advanced studies}, date = {1994/1997} } \end{filecontents } \documentclass{article} \usepackage{xltxtra} \setmainfont{dejavu serif} % or whatever \usepackage backend=biber, bibstyle=biblatex-sp-unified, citestyle=sp-authoryear-comp, maxcitenames=3, maxbibnames=99 {biblatex} \addbibresource{\jobname.bib} \begin{document} \textcite{sgds} \printbibliography \end{document} and the output https://github.com/semprag/biblatex-sp-unified/files/907779/mwe.pdf
