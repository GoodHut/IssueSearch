 URL : "https://github.com/istanbuljs/istanbuljs/issues/129" TITLE : html report details fail BODY : hello, when i run nyc for a typescript project with html reports enabled, there is an overview html file generated in the default coverage folder as coverage/index.html . it lists all my .ts-files. but when i click on any entry of the table, it yields an error like that it couldn't find the files. at closer investigation, there has been a directory double enlisted in the files path, i.e. instead of /home/.../myproject/src/myfile.ts it looks for /home/.../myproject/src/src/myfile.ts which does not exist. after some time i found the file /home/.../myproject/node_modules/nyc/node_modules/istanbul-lib-report/lib/context.js and when i insert there some additional check: function defaultsourcelookup path { try { if path.indexof 'src/src' > 0 { path = path.replace 'src/src','src' ; } return fs.readfilesync path, 'utf8' ; } catch ex { throw new error 'unable to lookup source: ' + path + ' ' + ex.message + ' ' ; } } everything works fine. but this is obviously an ugly approach to fix this. unfortunately, i am not a js expert, so i was not able to figure out, where this strange duplication is coming from. do i miss some configuration flag? inside my package.json there's only a small section for nyc: nyc : { include : src/ , reporter : html , exclude : src/ .d.ts , extension : .ts } os: ubuntu 16.04 lts node: 8.9.3 npm: 5.5.1 mocha: 4.1.0 nyc: 11.4.1
