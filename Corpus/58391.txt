 URL : "https://github.com/dkniffin/mtg-horde/issues/23" TITLE : show all attack damage BODY : the horde tends to have lots of creatures. it takes a long time to add up all those creatures' damage each turn. we should have something showing all combat damage coming at the survivors. this will only really be possible after 22.
