 URL : "https://github.com/djspiewak/parseback/issues/10" TITLE : error recovery tokens BODY : this falls into the straight-up research category. i'm pretty sure it's possible, and maybe even natural , to implement yacc-style error recovery using the derivative parsing algorithm. i think this falls out relatively naturally both due to the combinator-structure of the parse trail, and because derivative parsing by definition always parses to the end of the stream even when errors are hit early in the parse. so something like this might be possible: scala lazy val expr: parser expr = ... | { ~> error expr <~ } | ... or something to that effect. i say this is straight-up research because a practical and algorithmically coherent implementation of this idea or something better! is very much paper-worthy.
