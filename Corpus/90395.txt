 URL : "https://github.com/Brisbane-React-JS/meetups/issues/11" TITLE : setting up a build config BODY : sorting out webpack 2 and babel with various plugins is a big job and scares off a lot of people,who resort to creat react app. this limits freedom and choice. i'd be happy to present how i set up my build config, what tools i use, etc. this would include a full dev environment, including hot module replacement with the new react hot loader.
