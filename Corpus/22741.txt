 URL : "https://github.com/matthewbauer/random-ideas/issues/1" TITLE : meta db of nixpkgs BODY : nix is hard to build a package management solution on top of because it expects to evaluate the entire package set each time you retrieve a query. instead, why not generate a db with all of the information from the evaluation. this would only be useful in channels where you can't change any of the expressions. so, just provide that in the channel like with programs.sqlite.
