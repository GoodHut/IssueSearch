 URL : "https://github.com/drone/drone-cli/issues/42" TITLE : follow live build logs BODY : moved from https://github.com/drone/drone/issues/1794 --- i would like to get at the build logs via the drone cli. use case example with build number: drone build logs -f drone/drone 6 the -f option causes drone to not stop when end of file is reached, but rather to wait for additional data to be appended to the input. the -f option is ignored if the specified job has stopped. another way to get logs would be from the git commit hash: drone build logs -f drone/drone 240f2a8
