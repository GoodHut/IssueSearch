 URL : "https://github.com/texane/stlink/issues/656" TITLE : flash upload through gpio BODY : feature request - x operating system: linux hello everyone, as the title says i'd like to upload the compiled program via gpio pins to my board/stm chip. i have used atmega chips before and the program avrdude allowed this by connecting the gpio pins to the according spi pins see here https://learn.adafruit.com/program-an-avr-or-arduino-using-raspberry-pi-gpio-pins/overview . this would be useful for me so i can upload the program with a raspberry pi for example. i don't know how much effort it is to use the linuxgpio system and if stm32 chips are programable like this, so i'd be happy to get an opinion on this. thanks
