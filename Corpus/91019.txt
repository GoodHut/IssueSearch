 URL : "https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/issues/2234" TITLE : support kerberos tfs 2017 BODY : having tfs 2017 using ntlm authentication and git for windows using git credential manager, authentication for git works out of the box without any user interaction using kerberos. gcm stores the credentials with only username. as soon as git lfs is used an error is thrown your user name must be of the form domain\\user. it is currently foo . the only solution is to manually change the credential entry to a domain\user format, which is required to be done by every user. it would be nice if git lfs would support kerberos. see also: https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/git/manage-large-files known-issues
