 URL : "https://github.com/sa-lee/plyranges/issues/15" TITLE : read_bam return value BODY : current read_bam returns a galignments or galignmentslist. i think we want to hide that data structure from the user. it could instead return a granges groupedgranges for a galignmentslist with fields from the galignments as metadata columns. there then needs to be a way to do the equivalent of grglist ga , i.e., chop the ranges into a groupedgranges by introns or any gap. maybe chop_by_introns and chop_by_gaps both n's and d's .
