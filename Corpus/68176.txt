 URL : "https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/issues/209" TITLE : removing servo for now? BODY : servo refers to https://servo.org/ which is, unlike everything else, a browser engine and not a browser. it is sponsored by mozilla and runs on desktop systems and on android. i'm thinking about a few reasons why servo isn't a good fit for this data at the moment. - servo has no releases yet, so we can just add yes or no and no versions. - servo is being integrated into firefox and doesn't seem to be distributed widely as standalone software for now. - we also don't collect compat data for gecko or for any other engine. - we have no process to maintain servo's compat data, as there is no signal to us when something was implemented in servo no ddns like for firefox . - for mdn, it is unclear to me what additional value a reader web developer would get from seeing whether or not something is implemented in servo. any other thoughts on this?
