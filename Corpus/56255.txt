 URL : "https://github.com/git/git-scm.com/issues/1084" TITLE : mobile friendly layout BODY : the page rendering is not suited for mobile devices. on a smartphone display the page renders very small font. it is inconvenient to read the doc away from your laptop/pc. i would expect at least some reasonable font size and the text column stretching to cover the viewport.
