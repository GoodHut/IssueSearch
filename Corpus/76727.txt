 URL : "https://github.com/plerup/makeEspArduino/issues/59" TITLE : lwip2 support on esp8266 BODY : since a few days the arduino core for esp8266 supports the new lwip2 tcp/ip stack. if i understand correctly this new implementation can be switched to in the arduino ide menue. https://github.com/esp8266/arduino/pull/3783/commits/4f93f7f74f2f020f6260e7e7155f27785ea15b8c afaics there are 3 things necessary to link against lwip2: trigger the build of the library add the correct include path add the archive to the static libs lwip2 should improve memory consumption and excution speed, so it could be worthwhile to add support to makeesparduino.
