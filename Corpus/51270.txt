 URL : "https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues/1880" TITLE : adding a new colormode BODY : hi there! i was trying to create an addon that adds a new colormode to p5 based on hsluv http://www.hsluv.org/ , but i realized that the colormodes are harcoded into the source https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/master/src/color/p5.color.js l38-l41 . would you be open to me submitting a pull request that allows for addons to define new color modes? i would need to think about the best way of doing this, but perhaps a small registercolormode where you can pass in the name, the colormaxes, and the conversion functions? let me know you anyone has any better ideas.
