 URL : "https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk-catalog/issues/202" TITLE : cleanups for util actions BODY : @sjfink commented on fri nov 11 2016 https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk/issues/1500 a user was confused when making a sequence from one of our hello world examples to our wordcount issue. the issue is that hello returns a json object with an attribute message but wordcount expects an attribute payload . two suggestions: 1 decide on a uniform convention of the field name used by all our samples that produce or consume a single value. perhaps payload or value . 2 enhance wordcount and all our shell utils as follows: add an optional parameter 'fieldname . if fieldname is set, do the wordcount of the string of that field. if it's not set, then do the wordcount on the first field in the input object. --- @rabbah commented on tue jan 24 2017 https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk/issues/1500 issuecomment-274690316 this should be moved to openwhisk-catalog. @houshengbo @jasonpet @csantanapr.
