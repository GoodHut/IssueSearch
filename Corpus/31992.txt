 URL : "https://github.com/coreos/tectonic-forum/issues/46" TITLE : the problem is..... BODY : that if you advertise software on the interwebs that does a lot of boostrapping from the internet and the software is borked as in tectonic's case then everyone is constantly nuking their cluster nodes and restarting them trying to figure out what the hell is going on. that means download speeds for these nodes take weeks instead of days because everyone's custers is failing and everyone is constantly restarting everything. make sure your stuff works before you cause ddos on these poor repo providers.
