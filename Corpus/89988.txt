 URL : "https://github.com/linkedpipes/etl/issues/275" TITLE : restricted component list BODY : it is dangerous to allow components like delete directory to be run on a public web server. to avoid problems with import and export of pipelines, we should add a list of restricted components in configuration file of an lp-etl instance. components from this list would not run on that pipeline, but would be still accessible in pipelines.
