 URL : "https://github.com/duniter/duniter/issues/963" TITLE : blockchain slown down BODY : brunospiquel reported that the blockchain was maybe stuck this night, i could observe that it was actually very slow compared to habitual speed. i could see in the logs of my node that on a given block, this block wasn't always added to the blockchain, which is very strange. weirder: even if my node had such a bug, why other nodes did not succeed to spread the block they computed? finally, i simply restarted my node and all the network seems to be back to normal speed. it is a major bug.
