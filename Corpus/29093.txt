 URL : "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11821" TITLE : ipv6 support on ec2 BODY : aws ec2 supports https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-ipv6-support-for-ec2-instances-in-virtual-private-clouds/ ipv6, but the hazelcast explicitly forces using ipv4 https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/v3.9/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/instance/defaultaddresspicker.java l367-l375 when aws join is configured. java private boolean preferipv4stack { boolean preferipv4stack = boolean.getboolean java.net.preferipv4stack || hazelcastproperties.getboolean groupproperty.prefer_ipv4_stack ; // aws does not support ipv6 joinconfig join = config.getnetworkconfig .getjoin ; awsconfig awsconfig = join.getawsconfig ; boolean awsenabled = awsconfig != null && awsconfig.isenabled ; return preferipv4stack || awsenabled; } suggested fix: don't provide the configuration based artificial intelligence e.g. cloud-provider based . use just the system and/or hazelcast properties to control the ipv6 support. users should know themselves if their environment supports the ipv6.
