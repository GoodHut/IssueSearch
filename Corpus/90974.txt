 URL : "https://github.com/gmasterscm/ama/issues/20" TITLE : support for git worktrees BODY : consider adding support for the git worktree feature. we use it a lot for parallel branch development rather than cloning the same repository multiple times . at least some basic support so that a worktree can be added as an existing repository would be welcome. things like creating/pruning worktrees could come later.
