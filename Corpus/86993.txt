 URL : "https://github.com/fnoop/maverick/issues/567" TITLE : install issues odroid xu4 BODY : here are the issues: image writes fine boots fine. as on the raspberry, don't use self-update first. in my case, i setup up wifi, then wman0 and wap0, in localconf- ran maverick configure, and everything updated correctly. if you update first the first error is a set of boot issues, which also show up on the maverick configure update self update or not : the are 4 - unhandled faults - imprecise external abort xxxxxx had to use sudo -h with maverick configure, as it kept throwing out folder permission errors in .cache, and one other. after self update the odroid install has several different issues. after update - invalid class java_home . added this to tensorflow conf as an empty declaration which solved it. invalid class nginx . the modules folder has an empty folder for nginx. this was simple enough to figure out once i figured out puppet and manifests, and the install path for modules using puppet. the issue with nginx is that it won't install the correct dependencies - from puppet, that i could find using puppet-nginx and jfryman-nginx. jfryman throws a server::resource error. installing puppet-nginx --force fixes it adds the declaration to the .conf so when you maverick configure, it throws out a ton of dependency errors. i'm running fine - atm - without using self-update. i'll test this in a little bit. i'm sure it's just that you're updating things which is awesome, but it's pulling down some broken code. it's quite a little companion system you have..all the work is much appreciated.
