 URL : "https://github.com/Multiverse/Multiverse-Inventories/issues/305" TITLE : simplify inventory data BODY : bukkit has greatly improved its ability to serialize items since this plugin was first made. specifically it handles custom items very well. since this plugin doesnt handle custom items very well, it should probably just let bukkit do the serializing. this may mean moving back to yaml data files.
