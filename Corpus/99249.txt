 URL : "https://github.com/FallingUpGame/FallingUp/issues/2" TITLE : memory raycast overlap bug BODY : if the player looks at a memory object and there is another memory object close behind it, memory interaction essentially breaks. potentially fix this in the look function on the player blueprint by making the raycast not go through objects if possible.
