 URL : "https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/issues/1628" TITLE : legacy browser support BODY : are you requesting a feature or reporting a bug? feature. the doc https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/documentation/using-testcafe/common-concepts/browser-support.html officially-supported-browsers says > testcafe supports the latest version of each browser unless specified explicitly. 1. could you specify which versions of browser are supported? 2. do you have any plan to add supports for legacy browsers in the future? if only the latest ones are supported, testcafe seems not very useful because most of the projects are supposed to test on legacy browsers, not latest browsers. thanks
