 URL : "https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/issues/11187" TITLE : fiscal calendar doctype BODY : i would like to propose a new doctype called fiscal calendar. the purpose of this document is to allow an administrator to populate a calendar of various event dates that are important. there should be an option for each event to set a notification based on a group or something. some examples: - fiscal month start - fiscal month end - fiscal quarter start - fiscal quarter end - pay day - link to holiday schedule - estimated taxes due support for more than one tax type then employees can subscribe to the calendar. the idea is for employees to see on their calendar when paydates are or my accounting/finance folks to know when the fiscal periods begin/end or when taxes are due or whatever. thanks
