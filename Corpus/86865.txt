 URL : "https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python/issues/330" TITLE : improvements in agents.py BODY : while working on updating the docstring in agents.py, i noticed some discrepancies within the code. there were some differences between the algorithms pdf https://github.com/aimacode/aima-pseudocode/blob/master/aima3e-algorithms.pdf being used as a guide, the hardcopy of the book i have, the table https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python/blob/master/readme.md index-of-algorithms in the readme.md file, and agents.py https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python/blob/master/agents.py . for instance: tabledrivenagent: - not defined in agents.py tabledrivenagentprogram, and tabledrivenvacuumagent exist - in figure 2.3 in the pdf - in figure 2.7 in my textbook copy - claimed to be implemented in the readme.md table either i seem to be missing some obvious naming conventions/pseudocode sources, or this is a minor error that can be corrected. i have found similar issues regarding many other parts of agents.py, but am unsure if i am correct in assuming these to be errors. can somebody please verify this, as i have already started working on it?
