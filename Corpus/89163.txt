 URL : "https://github.com/pfn/passifox/issues/650" TITLE : ports not being picked up BODY : hi, first of all, really been struggling to find the perfect password manager but keepass and chromeipass has got me very close. anyway, i do a lot of .net development and my projects set up in visual studio run on localhost with different ports for each project. my problem is that the ports don't seem to be picked up properly - in keepass i put the url as localhost:12345 but chromeipass doesn't seem to pick up my credentials. if i change the url to localhost it works fine. obviously, this also brings back every other site just set to localhost . i did a search for this but only found the following issue: https://github.com/pfn/passifox/issues/87 - this appears to suggest that it should work but doesn't seem to for me. am i doing something wrong or is this not supported? thanks, ben
