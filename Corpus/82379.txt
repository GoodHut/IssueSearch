 URL : "https://github.com/readium/r2-streamer-swift/issues/37" TITLE : add support for subtitles BODY : in epub 3.0.x it's possible to indicate that a title is a subtitle: <dc:title id= title_2 >all about epub 3.1</dc:title> <meta refines= title_2 property= title-type >subtitle</meta> <meta refines= title_2 property= display-seq >2</meta> a recent revision to the readium web publication manifest also added a subtitle element to play the same role. we need to add support for subtitles in the streamer, using the same multi-lingual model as the title element.
