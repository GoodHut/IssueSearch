BODY : hi! first of all, i love photato. i'm setting up a private selfhosted gallery for baby pics and have gone through five other open source gallery projects. all of them were lacking in some severe way compared with what i wanted. photato though... it's got everything i was hoping for, especially the auto-updating when a picture is added. perfect. anyway, on to the question. is it possible to configure an album to sort so that the most recent photos appear at the top? it would be nice to not have to scroll to the bottom to find the latest pictures. based on this https://github.com/trebonius0/photato/blob/777bd4aa06a8fec495866b9dcb3651d2f7765222/src/photato/controllers/folderlisthandler.java l38 it doesn't seem possible but i figured i'd ask. i could even take a stab on adding that if you like the idea.
