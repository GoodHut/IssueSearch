 URL : "https://github.com/rjust/defects4j/issues/119" TITLE : issue of replaying bugs BODY : hi, i observe that the defects4j has the same output for each bug no matter what jdk version i am using. however, the behavior of some test cases may change when i am using different jdks. following the suggestion of readme file, i am now using jdk of version 1.7.0_76. however, some bug still cannot be replayed despite the defects4j command indicates there should be an exception to occur. the case happens in the first bug of lang, so it should not have something to do with the timezone. for now, i want to replay the defects4j bugs within eclipse environment. i wonder whether defects4j has its own jdk? if not, what environment i need to set up for having the same running effects as the defects4j command? thanks a lot!
