 URL : "https://github.com/qiime2/q2-types/issues/99" TITLE : super type for phylogeny BODY : right now phylogeny implies that it will only be allowed to handle phylogenetic trees. but there are many tree like structures that could be made - for instance hierarchical clusterings. could we create a super type, for example hierarchy that could encompass both phylogenies and clusterings?
