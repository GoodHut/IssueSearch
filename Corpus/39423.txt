 URL : "https://github.com/SteamRE/DepotDownloader/issues/22" TITLE : sessions / autologin BODY : please add the ability to keep a login session open so that one doesn't need to log in every time they run a command, or need to do 2fa every time. if the tool writes some sort of session file that would work but i feel it would be the most flexible if there was a way to return the auth token and pass it as an argument.
