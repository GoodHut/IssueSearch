 URL : "https://github.com/Shopify/themekit/issues/373" TITLE : documentation of commands BODY : hi, working on migrating to this since the shopify_theme gem isn't supported anymore. upon following the documentation when i ran the configure command with credentials i got this error: split': bad uri is not uri? : https://--themeid= 180785167 /admin/assets.json uri::invalidurierror i ran the command in the format specified, so: theme configure --password= my-password --store= my-store.myshopify.com --themeid= your-theme-id however, when i ran it in this format it worked fine: theme configure api_key password connors-development-store.myshopify.com theme_id i'm not sure if i did something wrong on my end or the docs need to be updated but i wanted to bring it to light.
