 URL : "https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/8658" TITLE : travis performance query BODY : hi, first of all sorry if this is no the place to ask this question. please point me to the correct place. i run the test suite of my rails application on travis using the knapsack gem. earlier it use to take about roughly 40minutes to run each thread. i did some optimisations in the test suite and brought it down to around 25 minutes each. but recently i have been noticing that each thread on an average finishes at around 15 minutes. i dont know the reason behind this. has travis made some massive improvements in this front? second, i have been seeing that a lot of test cases are skipped specially the request/feature specs which explains why the time to run the test cases is reduced significantly. also it happens that some test cases which are run on one pr and fails are not at all together run on a different pr. what could be the reason behind this? something to do with how travis creates the order of the test cases or could be to do with knapsack? thanks.
