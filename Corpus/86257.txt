 URL : "https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/issues/1072" TITLE : help wanted adding a list BODY : i would like to add the hack-with-github/awesome-hacking https://github.com/hack-with-github/awesome-hacking list, but have a couple problems. it's not mine. therefore i can't edit things like github topics. incorrect formatting. awesome-hacking does not conform to most of the guidelines required to be on this list, but i don't feel comfortable redesigning their entire list just to have it here. list of lists. are lists of other lists of actual things accepted here? can't really tell. thanks!
