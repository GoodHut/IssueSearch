 URL : "https://github.com/sum01/fmt-micro/issues/13" TITLE : should probably use oop BODY : as it is now, the code is kind of hastily written, and could probably benefit from oop. each insert could be changed to something like lua fmt_list fmt_list + 1 = formatter:new lang = { css , html , javascript }, cli = js-beautify , args = { -r , -f } which should cut down on all the looping it does. at the same time, maybe a display_name could be added, so that the user can use that instead of the cli command as the name. this would help on some formatters that require odd cli calls, such as formatr with it's formatr::input or whatever.
