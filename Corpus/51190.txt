 URL : "https://github.com/TresAmigosSD/SMV/issues/548" TITLE : add support to windows BODY : with a quick try, it sounds no very hard to run smv on windows. i followed install spark https://hernandezpaul.wordpress.com/2016/01/24/apache-spark-installation-on-windows-10/ no need to install scala though , with replacing the spark binary to our release. also manually run smv pyshell after set some environment variables. the only thing i still have some issue is the permission of /tmp/hive when i run cmd as a normal user. when run cmd as admin, everything is fine. here is what we need to do: create a windows install document install java install winutils.exe hadoop binary for windows install spark and smv prebuild packages install python 2.7 and jupyter setup environment create scripts for windows smv-pyshell.cmd smv-pyrun.cmd smv-jupyter.cmd
