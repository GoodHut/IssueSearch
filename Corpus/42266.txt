 URL : "https://github.com/nodejs/abi-stable-node/issues/202" TITLE : apis for es6 dataview BODY : n-api currently has apis for arraybuffer and typedarray classes, but not the dataview class. the dataview class https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/javascript/reference/global_objects/dataview is specified by es6 as another kind of view over an arraybuffer . while it could be possible to extend and rename? napi_create_typedarray and napi_get_typedarray_info to also support dataview objects, i think the combination would be too confusing, because a dataview doesn't have a type, and measures length in terms of bytes instead of elements. so, probably there should be separate apis: - napi_is_dataview - napi_create_dataview - napi_get_dataview_info
