 URL : "https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk-workshop/issues/10" TITLE : remove geocoding api task BODY : i already suggested breaking out that task into multiple, but i'd suggest removing the geocoding task completely as it requires a dev to go out and get a key before using the api. that's not terribly difficult, but it is a process and it's a hassle a dev doesn't want to worry about when learning openwhisk.
