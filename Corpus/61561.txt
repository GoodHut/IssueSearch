 URL : "https://github.com/RichardLitt/nomad-as-fuck/issues/23" TITLE : base_path totally sucks BODY : basically, i can't test this domain locally, because i can't find a way for base_path to use localhost:4000 as the domain to use, so it continually just points to https://nomadasfuck.com , which shouldn't be happening. i've wasted maybe.. 2 hours on this problem? it makes me angry. i'm putting this issue here to remind myself not to bother in the future.
