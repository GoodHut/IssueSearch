 URL : "https://github.com/josdejong/workerpool/issues/20" TITLE : support binary data BODY : web workers can pass binary data, but this doesn't work in workerpool. the stdio option for child processes was added a bit ago, and allows creation of the ipc channel, which can then be leveraged for sending binary data. additionally there's the new cluster native module https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/test/parallel/test-cluster-fork-stdio.js which automates a lot of this. i'd love the workerpool api available on top of either one of these approaches so i can have a robust solution that works on both web and node.
