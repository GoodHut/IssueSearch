 URL : "https://github.com/gerritv/Grbl-Panel/issues/93" TITLE : how to change baud rate BODY : not an issue as much as a question. how do i change the baud rate in grbl panel. tried just typing a new baud rate into the baud rate window, as well as in grblpanel.exe.config </setting> <setting name= baud serializeas= string > <value>38400</value> </setting> but still can't connect. i know the arduino baud rate is right because i can connect to it via the ide console. note - this is via direct usb, not via usb-serial converter
