 URL : "https://github.com/SpartanRefactoring/Spartanizer/issues/1257" TITLE : bug in subject/plant BODY : when using subject operands on the expressions 0 and ++b with operator +, the result is 0+++b . however, this does not compile, as it is considered as 0 with postfix increment added to b. if 0 is replaced with a variable the code compiles, but gives the wrong result. this is most likely a problem with plant, that removes parenthesis when it shouldn't be removed.
