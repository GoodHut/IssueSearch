 URL : "https://github.com/rmmmp/emberfire-utils/issues/15" TITLE : improve fastboot support BODY : there's some race condition happening in haslimited on fastboot where loading it in the template will cause unfinished renders in fastboot. this is happening because fastboot doesn't wait for the haslimited to completely resolve before returning the html to the client. to fix this, we need to have haslimited to resolve with the initial requested data rather than resolving with an empty array and then mutating it with the data as it gets fetched. this change will also affect query as haslimited is built on top of it.
