 URL : "https://github.com/theturtle32/WebSocket-Node/issues/277" TITLE : changing client ip/origin BODY : i finally realized what's been causing me problems in a new improved iteration. needing multiple cpus, i've forked nodejs instances and having the second instance use another ip attached to the same interface. when it goes to connect as a client server to server communication , the client request i can try to pass the real alternative secondary ip but as it then goes to the connect method it still has the default primary ip of the machine. i've tried setting origin and i see it in the request it's not changed the remoteaddress in the connection and messages the follow. how can i tell the client which ip it is using? i've noticed the remoteaddresses where there is an array for multiple addresses so it feels like this was never properly addressed and i'm not sure where i can resolve the problem. https://github.com/theturtle32/websocket-node/blob/master/lib/websocketclient.js i'm not interested in using different ports, it's not an option. i fear i'm going to have to get the primary server to establish all local secondary ip connections as it simple seems there is no way to make a connection from a client process that is running a secondary ip address, and set which ip shows up in the remoteaddress of the servers connection. i know it's complicated, just ask for clarity if you need it, please.
