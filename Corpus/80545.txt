 URL : "https://github.com/jhpoelen/fb-osmose-bridge/issues/110" TITLE : ui step 2 - issue no. 13 BODY : i just ran a test with the ui, where i requested parameters for an osmose model for the iceland/shelf sea ecosystem. in the table provided in step 2, i noticed that some of the functional groups defined by the ui include both fish species and invertebrate species. for example, the pelagicsm functional group includes: 1 three fish species: mallotus villosus, benthosema glaciale, and notoscopelus kroyeri actinopterygii ; and 2 one invertebrate species: calanus finmarchicus maxillopoda . instead of one single pelagicsm functional group, the ui should define two functional groups: 1 fishpelagicsm , including the three fish species; and 2 invertpelagicsm including the invertebrate species. -----> all the functional groups defined by the ui should include: 1 only fish species; or 2 only invertebrate species. could you please correct for this? many thanks.
