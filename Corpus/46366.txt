 URL : "https://github.com/prismicio/prismic-dom/issues/13" TITLE : make debugging easier BODY : i am using prismic-dom with next.js, which means the rendering happens on the server side. currently importing prismic-dom imports the minified version dist/prismic-dom.min.js . if there's any issues for example, i was debugging 12 , it is quite hard to debug as it points to minified version. as a workaround, i tried to point it to prismic-dom/src . but then it needs changing of es6 module system to common js. i think this would make debugging a little easier. what do you people think? would you be interested if i change the es6 module syntax to common js and send out a pr? there's only 4 imports in total, so there's not much
