 URL : "https://github.com/Signbank/FinSL-signbank/issues/231" TITLE : relations between glosses BODY : users want to be able to add different kind of relations between glosses. the most mentioned one is also see this gloss , which would most likely mean that the signs/glosses are similar in some way, and that the user should check the other gloss as well to be sure. ngt-signbank has this feature and it is in finsl too due to the fact that we forked from ngt. we might however want to revise it some way. one thing that i am considering doing is removing the fieldchoice feature, which allows users dynamically add and remoce choices to different models.
