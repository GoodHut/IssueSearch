 URL : "https://github.com/hairyhenderson/gomplate/issues/151" TITLE : gomplate needs a man page! BODY : see https://github.com/hairyhenderson/gomplate/pull/149 issuecomment-303927606 for the genesis of this conversation. the ideal would be to be able to use _some of_ the same markdown for both the doc site gomplate.hairyhenderson.ca and the man page. a few tools exist for this, looks like ronn 1 https://rtomayko.github.io/ronn/ronn.1.html is a good option. once the man page generation is figured out, it needs to be packaged. it'd need to be packaged with both the alpine https://github.com/alpinelinux/aports/blob/master/community/gomplate/apkbuild and homebrew https://github.com/hairyhenderson/homebrew-tap/blob/master/gomplate.rb packages and any new packages... .
