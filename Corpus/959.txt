BODY : currently we use circleci 1.0 which gets the job done ok, but i'm interested in seeing if we can level up our ci, maybe use something better. this is not urgent, just exploratory at this point. what circleci 1.0 does well generally pretty easy to work with. handy ssh logins to troubleshoot problems with our current solution which i would like to address no parrallelisation, slowing everything down. most of our steps could run independently. we employ a lot of hacks. symlinking the checkout to the gopath-directory, installing the desired latest go version, installing docker-compose via a shellscript, ... sometimes things don't work well and it can be hard to figure out. possibly related to the hacks our caching strategy is suboptimal e.g. install fpm/packagecloud gems every time nice to haves / bonus features in a new system allow more cluster testing using docker-compose, bring up more complicated stacks, ability to tinker with the network in an automated way using tc/netem tracking of performance stats benchmark results over time and visualizing them test against multiple go versions circleci 2.0 docker executor looks nice in that it's lightweight to run, can use custom image with all needed dependencies fpm, packagecloud, 3rd party go tools, etc preinstalled. but has some major downsides: cannot use docker-compose with volumes that use data from the checked out code dir cannot talk to containers directly from the main container. see https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/building-docker-images/ for more details
