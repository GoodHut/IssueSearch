 URL : "https://github.com/CarlFK/video-stack-deploy/issues/27" TITLE : uefi pxe doesn't use ipxe BODY : there are config lines that should work, but for some mysterious reason they don't. there is a workaround that skips the ipxe step, which is only needed for debugging. someone in grub said it looks like a bug in grub, which was enough for me to stop caring as no one needs uefi anyway. yet.
