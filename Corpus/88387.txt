 URL : "https://github.com/daverees4/rcm-website-version-7/issues/87" TITLE : new spacing option for h3 BODY : there's a point in basecamp about space under h3 headings in the 'courses available' sections on faculty pages. i thought i could fix with a quick hack, but' it just makes matters worse. i hadn't realised the issue was at s1 only. to fix it properly i need to be able to change the bottom margin of _selected_ h3 headings to 0.4rem at s1 only. is this easiest to do with a custom subclass? david i'll let you advise on the best approach. katherine can decide whether or not she wants to make this a priority.
