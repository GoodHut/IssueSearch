 URL : "https://github.com/bucharest-gold/nodeshift/issues/59" TITLE : build and deploy hooks BODY : i just wanted to create this issue so i wouldn't forget. it would be interesting if nodeshift had different stages that could be hooked into. similar to how ember-deploy works: http://ember-cli-deploy.com/ this sort of goes along with how the maven plugin allows you to supply different enrichers.
