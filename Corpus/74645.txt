 URL : "https://github.com/mtgred/netrunner/issues/2518" TITLE : fairchild in deckbuilder BODY : i uploaded a deck a txt-file . i used the fairchild ices, more specific: 2x fairchild 1.0 2x fairchild 2.0 2x fairchild 3.0 1x fairchild the deckbuilder interpreted it as: 2x fairchild 2x fairchild 2x fairchild 1x fairchild and assumed it was a perfectly legal deck. so there are 2 minor bugs: the deckbuilder didn't recognise fairchild x.0 and the deckbuilder didn't recognise the deck it as incorrect.
