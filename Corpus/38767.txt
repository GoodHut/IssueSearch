 URL : "https://github.com/jamiealquiza/polymur/issues/75" TITLE : queue capacity issue BODY : i've got polymur running in a docker container on a mesos/marathon cluster but i'm running into an issue with it reaching the carbon-cache backends. it looks like the queue capacity is set to 0, even though i've tried increasing it with the option flags. here's what i'm using to start polymur: /go/bin/polymur -listen-addr 0.0.0.0:2003 -stat-addr 0.0.0.0:2020 -api-addr 0.0.0.0:2030 -distribution hash-route -console-out -outgoing-queue-cap 8192 -incoming-queue-cap 65536 it starts up fine, accepts metrics, and the carbon-cache instance is able to register with it and seems to be working correclty. however polymur's output shows the capacity of the queue is zero and drops all messages destined for the carbon cache even before i send any metrics. 2017/12/12 03:11:44 adding destination to connection pool: hostname.domain.com:31501 2017/12/12 03:11:44 destination hostname.domain.com:31501 queue is at capacity 0 - further messages will be dropped has anyone run into this before? am i doing something incorrectly?
