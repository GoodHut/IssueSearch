 URL : "https://github.com/thraaawn/CompactMachines/issues/264" TITLE : ae2 cables not connecting BODY : in the latest version of the modern skyblock 2 pack, which is using compact machines 3.0.3, ae2 cables aren't connecting into a compact machine correctly. i have the tunnel configured to face the correct side, and the tooltip even indicates that it is working as an ae2 bus/cable. i've tried fluix cables as well as smart buses. they don't visually connect or show up on the network.
