 URL : "https://github.com/badvision/lawless-legends/issues/25" TITLE : 4-digit hp goes off screen BODY : i cheated my way to this with sector editing, but it still might be an issue if someone allows unlimited leveling up. i remember bard's tale iii allowed for ++++/++++ once hp went above 9999 using the inwo trick and i'm wondering if the core technology can/should do the same only 3 +++'s , or at least give a warning. the way to reproduce this is 1 save a game state in applewin 2 download a hex editor like hxd. search for player 1's name, or go to bytes ef96/efa3 if you're feeling lucky, and change the 2-byte entries to 08 08 or whatever...second byte should be >= 4. 3 try to use an item, then bail. your new current/maximum hp will run off the screen.
