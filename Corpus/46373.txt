 URL : "https://github.com/vuejs/vue-class-component/issues/161" TITLE : make imports implicit BODY : just as a stylistic point, is there perhaps anyway this library can be tweaked so that importing vue and component isn't needed for every component? could we somehow make those implicit? i tried fiddling with the webpack provideplugin to no avail. typescript import vue from 'vue' import component from 'vue-class-component' @component export class foocomponent extends vue { } i find that vue and component import so superfluous to have to include in very component.
