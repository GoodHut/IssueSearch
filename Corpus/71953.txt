 URL : "https://github.com/realm/realm-mobile-platform/issues/118" TITLE : app level authentication BODY : hi, ros is able to handle multiple apps which is great. so, if a user registers to an app previously and then tries to register to another app considering the user is not aware of the server level authentication , there will be an error. is there a workaround for this issue? thanks.
