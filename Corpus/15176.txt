 URL : "https://github.com/RichardSilveira/EntityFramework.MoqHelper/issues/1" TITLE : create new entity BODY : would you help me with the following scenario? when i add a new entity with a foreign key the keys are not added automatically after i call context.savechanges . class parent { guid id; string name; } class child { parent parent; guid parentid; guid id; string name; } parent parent = new parent { id = guid.newguid , name = parent } child child = new child { parent = parent, id = guid.newguid , name = child } context.childs.add child ; context.savechanges ; but when i get the parentid of the child context.childs.first .parentid the value was null. in ef that behavior does not happen. how can i get the same behavior with this library?
