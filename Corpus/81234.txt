 URL : "https://github.com/clarkduvall/hyperloglog/issues/20" TITLE : weird results post-merge BODY : i know hll's aren't supposed to be accurate, so if this is simply a case of finding a limitation in the accuracy then that's cool, i just wanted to double check. i have the following code: func main { add := func hll hyperloglog.hyperloglogplus, i int { h := fnv.new64a h.write byte strconv.itoa i hll.add h } a, _ := hyperloglog.newplus 12 for i := 0; i < 10000; i++ { add a, i%100 } fmt.printf a: %d , a.count b, _ := hyperloglog.newplus 12 for i := 0; i < 10000; i++ { add b, i%100 +5 } fmt.printf b: %d , b.count a.merge b fmt.printf a+b: %d , a.count } i get the output: a: 100 b: 100 a+b: 6 so the counts for a and b individually look good, but post-merge it seems to get borked. again, just wanted to check if this is a bug vs a limitation in what hll's can actually do. thanks!
