 URL : "https://github.com/fengyuanchen/cropperjs/issues/133" TITLE : setting max zoom BODY : first of all this is the best cropper i have found and version 1.0 -beta rocks. just an idea for future development is to make zoom maximum, if you use it on phone with settings bellow it works the same asfacebook crop which is kinda perfect because users are already familiar with that kind of cropping it feels native. next is the thing that is kinda bugging me and i will try to fix it this week. setting the maximum zoom of picture so when cropped picture doesnt feel low quality. because you usually know which kind of picture minimum width and height you want. what happens is if you use the settings below users can theoretically inifinitly zoom picture which will produce really shitty quality. anyway i will try to fix it and submit code to you, if i don't manage i would super love you if you could do it : keep up with good work. love you champ <3 dragmode: 'move', aspectratio: 0.76910828025, movable: true, zoomable: true, cropboxmovable: false, cropboxresizable: false, checkorientation: true, resizable: true, resize: true, autocroparea: 0.6, viewmode: 1,
