 URL : "https://github.com/nextcloud/updater/issues/150" TITLE : acme letsencrypt vs update BODY : i just came across this issue, as i want to update my server. as mentioned in 92 it would be a problem if there are additional directories. the .well-known folder of the acme challange for the certificates is not excluded, and as this could be a common problem it should be. -> therefore a new issue
