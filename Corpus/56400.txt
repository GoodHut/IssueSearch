 URL : "https://github.com/Ellie7/parrot-proj/issues/9" TITLE : myfunc doesn't like 1s BODY : i've finished all my coding for figure 1 now but it won't produce figure 1b correctly because my function myfunc, well more my code within the function for calculating ps and gs doesn't like it when the survivorship values are 1, the whole thing works fine with 0.999 so i think it's just the 1 thing.
