 URL : "https://github.com/joshp23/YOURLS-U-SRV/issues/2" TITLE : hardening the script BODY : it would be better to not send file names in url, only a hash. appending some possibly user defined prefix and the file extension in srv.php after transmission will further obfuscate the file locations. the file extension and prefix could both be retrieved as options from database, or hard written into the script. this would also require updating the plugins that rely on this script. further, only accepting inputs that are exactly 32 chars long output of md5 is always 32 chars would further harden against attack.
