 URL : "https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/issues/671" TITLE : schema validate only uses BODY : in our code every field is aliased using load from . this is a simplified example . python class exampleschema schema : session_id = fields.string load_from='si', validate= length equal=12 geo_location = fields.string load_from='gl', required=true input looks like '80,80' @validates 'geo_location' def validate_geo_location self, value : latitude, longitude = value.split ',' latitude = int latitude if latitude < -90 or latitude > 90: raise validationerror 'latitude is out of range' currently, exampleschema.validates returns errors like this: {'si': u'length must be 12.' , 'gl': u'missing data for required field.' } notice that the field name in the validation errors refers to the load_from name and not the name supplied by exampleschema .fields, which makes sense, but we would like to have something like validate_to to ensure that this output looks like this: {'session_id': u'length must be 12.' , 'geo_location': u'missing data for required field.' } a possibly important note, if we have a validation error for the custom validator it does gives us our desired behavior, but only for that field that has been custom validated, i.e.: {'si': u'length must be 12.' , 'geo_location': 'latitude is out of range' } i tried playing around with dump_to , attribute , etc. but they only seem to change the field name in successfully serialized data, not in errors. thanks for any help/updates! i can add more clarity if necessary.
