BODY : hi @dragonfly90 i finish my own data.json for a new dataset according to annotation.ipynb and change generatelabelcpm.py to fit the keypoints. i want to use trainweight.py to fine tune. but i get the following error: runtimeerror: simple_bind error. arguments: data: 1, 3, 368, 368 heatmaplabel: 1, 19, 46, 46 heatweight: 1, 19, 46, 46 partaffinityglabel: 1, 38, 46, 46 vecweight: 1, 38, 46, 46 this is caused by file trainweight.py , line 88, in <module> cmodel.fit cocodata, num_epoch = config.train.num_epoch, arg_params=arg_params, aux_params=aux_params file trainweight.py , line 19, in fit 'vecweight', 1,38,46,46 i think it may be the shapes are not matched with pre-trained model. so i change my mydata.json to the previous data.json for coco. but it still has the same error. do you know the reason? thank you very much!
