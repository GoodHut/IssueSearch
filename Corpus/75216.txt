 URL : "https://github.com/The-Balthazar/BrewLAN/issues/21" TITLE : glad to see still active BODY : i noted the log files added. just finished an upgrade of my gaming machine etc here, finally back in the saddle power surge last year fried or partially borked all 3 of my best computers, been in various stages of repair . in the file of planned/complete units, a few i noted. experimental uef point defense - the annihilator, that's the ta unit's name. not a bad unit really, few of them and some bertha's made for a nice hedgehog. thing is, that annihilator model exists in game now, its the upper part of the harbinger almost to a t . i still think having the seraphim exp arty toss modified ulthouy sp would be a wicked dynamic in keeping with their tech. the pinwheel designed looks badass, just figured having it not actually perform like other races arty would keep variety. experimental air staging - its either blackops or deep blue naval that had a good model for this. they had engineering stations, aa, shields and torps. if going for mobile, well aeon's got the czar, blackops has the uef citadel. i see you had the engineering boat idea as tech 1, i'll have to reinstall and see how that looks if that's been implemented . last i played, we still had crash issues with faf forged alliance. the key problem with that conflict is most players playing the game, are going to be updated with faf version as steam etc direct them there.
