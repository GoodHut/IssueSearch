 URL : "https://github.com/Michael-F-Bryan/include_dir/issues/15" TITLE : find takes a path BODY : at the moment, the dir::find function only checks to see if a file's name everything after the last / is the same as the specified string. in some situations you may want to provide a file path relative to the embedded directory's root because of naming conflicts across dirs, etc . dir::find should have a signature which takes anything which is asref<path> .
