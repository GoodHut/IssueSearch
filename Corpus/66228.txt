 URL : "https://github.com/thestonefox/VRTK/issues/1005" TITLE : menu button not working BODY : using the latest asset store version with unity 5.5, the menu button doesn't generate the expected events. i tracked it down to sdk_steamvrcontroller.cs, which was checking button a instead of application menu. solved it by replacing k_evrbuttonid.k_ebutton_a with k_ebutton_applicationmenu throughout.
