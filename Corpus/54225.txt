 URL : "https://github.com/glua/gm_voxelate/issues/43" TITLE : fix naming conventions BODY : the exposed c++<->lua api is fairly consistent, but the pure lua api is messy as fuck. here's how i'm doing it: - local vars are simplecasecamelcased - global vars are uppercasecamelcased, with the exception of gm_voxelate - class methods are uppercasecamelcased - avoid using snake_case because it looks weird af tbh thoughts @birdbrainswagtrain ?
