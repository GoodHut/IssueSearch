 URL : "https://github.com/BinarMorker/TimeWastedOnDestiny/issues/34" TITLE : cors headers for the api BODY : hey there, i'm trying to use the api within a simple single page app which means making the api call from the front end. i was wondering whether - since it's a public api - you could make it return cors headers? thanks for providing an api by the way! not enough devs are willing to do this these days üëç
