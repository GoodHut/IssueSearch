 URL : "https://github.com/carrotsrc/rsnl/issues/4" TITLE : implement the route stuff BODY : i can do it, but i'm starting with rust, and i'm a bit lost in libnl. what i'm looking for is a way to delete a link. so, on in libnl documentation https://www.infradead.org/~tgr/libnl/doc/route.html _delete i found this: c struct rtnl_link link; if ! link = rtnl_link_alloc / error / rtnl_link_set_name link, my_vlan ; if rtnl_link_delete sock, link < 0 / error / rtnl_link_put link ; since i'm not in a hurry it's for a side project , i might as well to the right thing and contribute to this project. so i have a few newbie questions: you just wrap the c libnl, that's it? so if i want the route part or at least the rtnl_link_ stuff, i just write the wrappers around the c lib using your style, in a route mod? also, are you ok with me just doing the part i need? i can work on a bit more, to at least provide a whole api for the route module, not just half of the functions. thanks for your time answering this, and thanks for this lib :
