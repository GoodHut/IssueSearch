 URL : "https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/17826" TITLE : npm pachages install fail BODY : i'm opening this issue because: - npm is doing something i don't understand. what's going wrong? first of all i want to apologize if this is not right place for this issue or the info is not full. i am trying to create a new angular project. it was already installed, but when creating it starts to install some packages and fails. after that the command prompt cannot recognize a simple ng command and states 'ng' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. how can the cli team reproduce the problem? i was not able to find this file, so will paste the issue here: installing packages for tooling via npm. 'npm' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. package install failed, see above. d:\temp\nv ode-v6.11.1-win-x64 ode_modules\@angular\cli\tasks pm-install.js:2 5 throw new error message ; ^ error: package install failed, see above. at child_process_1.exec d:\temp\nv ode-v6.11.1-win-x64 ode_modules\@angul ar\cli\tasks pm-install.js:25:27 at childprocess.exithandler child_process.js:211:5 at emittwo events.js:106:13 at childprocess.emit events.js:191:7 at maybeclose internal/child_process.js:891:16 at process.childprocess._handle.onexit internal/child_process.js:226:5 supporting information: - npm -v prints: v6.11.1 - node -v prints: 3.10.10 - npm config get registry prints: https://registry.npmjs.org/ - windows, os x/macos, or linux?: windows 64bit - network issues: - geographic location where npm was run: bulgaria
