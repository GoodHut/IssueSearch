BODY : hello. i highly appreciate you sharing vatic-docker. it helps me a lot. i wonder how to use video options such as adjusting the length of each segment for the video in frames, as the original vatic suggests - https://github.com/cvondrick/vatic. in the docker container, the length is 100, but i want to increase it. could you tell me how to change the options?
