 URL : "https://github.com/ljsimin/MinecraftJoypadSplitscreenMod/issues/34" TITLE : no true analog movement BODY : when using the left control stick to walk around, you do this at one of eight fixed angles, with constant velocity. however, for me, the whole point of using a gamepad is to smoothly control the speed and direction i'm walking in. i haven't looked into the code, but it seems like the analog inputs are simply converted to a binary signal button pressed vs. not pressed . gameplay would feel much smoother if the walking speed was directly derived from the position of the analog stick.
