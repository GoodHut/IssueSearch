 URL : "https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science/issues/4854" TITLE : viennarna is outdated BODY : viennarna in mac brew is version 2.1.9, but the latest version is 2.3.1 and the url is different. i tried brew edit viennarna and change the url + checksum to rebuild from source, but the source archive is sent as an attachment and brew seems unable to handle it properly. there's a dmg available for download, so maybe viennarna shoould move to the caskroom. what do you think?
