 URL : "https://github.com/IDPF/epubcheck/issues/824" TITLE : question test clean up BODY : hi @rdeltour @tofi86 @mattgarrish i've just read through the clean up test documentation on the wiki with all the different links. and i just want to clarify that i understood the task. we need to reorganize the test under src/test/resources and all these are present in multiple directories today namely 20 30 com.adobe.epubcheck css minimal-epub stress all of these are incorrect and need to be replaced with new tests. the new test directory should be called src/test/resources/testfiles ? don't like the camelcase where a package name is more java native eg. test.files . i'm not really keen on the naming either but if you decided then i will fall in line. the rest of the structure under testfiles should follow the outlined structure from the epubcheck tests directory structure proposal with either long names or short names depending on the first implementer doing the job. last part that puzzled me was that the proposal talked about using exploded epubs preferably for readability or reusability of tests. i'm not sure what the benefits are but i might have missed something there. the reason i ask these questions is that i might get bored during the holidays and if i don't have any private projects that need tinkering i might give this task a go. best regards daniel
