 URL : "https://github.com/contentacms/contenta_angular/issues/71" TITLE : add travis build stages BODY : our builds are getting longer, sometimes over 10 minutes now, so we should look into adding build stages in travis so we can do things like run our lint, unit, and e2e tests concurrently. i don't know much about build stages yet but contenta_jsonapi is already using them, so that's a good place to look for examples i suppose.
