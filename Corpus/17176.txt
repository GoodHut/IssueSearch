 URL : "https://github.com/adafruit/ArduinoCore-samd/issues/7" TITLE : no floating point BODY : a big advantage of the d51 is hardware floating point, but i don't see any attempts to turn it on, yet, either in the init code it might be automatic in atmel startup files? or in the compiler options. this is a little fraught with peril, as an immediate effect of floating point is an additional 128 bytes of registers that have to be preserved during context switching ie for isrs. cm4f has a feature called lazy context save of fp state that should probably be used. with lazy , stack space is reserved for the fp registers in isrs, but not actually saved unless you use a floating-point instruction. do you want issues reported against d51 yet? or should i go away until you say go ?
