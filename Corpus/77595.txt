 URL : "https://github.com/cytopia/devilbox/issues/71" TITLE : no host dns record found BODY : the virtual hosts menu option lists all my projects with a err message: no host dns record found. add the following to /etc/hosts: 127.0.0.1 domain.loc because i'm running under windows 10, my hosts file uses the default virtualbox ip address: 192.168.99.100 domain.loc however the project loads normally without any problems, only the host list of devilbox shows this error and with no apparent side effects.
