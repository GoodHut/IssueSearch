 URL : "https://github.com/AnyDSL/impala/issues/72" TITLE : type inference bug BODY : the following example should be rejected by the type system: rust enum direction { left, right }; fn get_direction dir: i32, body: fn direction -> -> { if dir == 0 { body direction::left } else { body dir } } however, it passes and fails only in the verify phase later on: test.impala:7 col 14 - 16: error: mismatched types: expected '<infer error: direction, i32>' but found 'i32' as argument type
