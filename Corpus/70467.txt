BODY : perhaps this is just my setup in some way - but for a couple of weeks now i've lost all weather data on obsidian. i've tried changing weather providers, unistalling/reinstalling etc., but no joy. i have been using weather underground with an api key, but even switching back to open weathermap i get nothing. other inferior faces get their weather data. is it just me? or has something changed? i'm on android 8.0.0. i hope you're still using and supporting this face it's head and shoulders above the rest, imo though if it is just a problem in my setup i suppose i'm on my own... : . any debugging pointers gratefully received.
