 URL : "https://github.com/jthomas/node-red-contrib-npm/issues/5" TITLE : custom code example? BODY : am struggling with using the custom code, and examples would help. have a working node red installation and installed this and other components. want to use the tplink-lightbulb node, https://www.npmjs.com/package/tplink-lightbulb, but cannot understand how to get this module to trigger the relevant actions - e.g. turn bulb on. assistance appreciated - it's a user problem rather than a technical issue.....
