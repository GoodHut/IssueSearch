 URL : "https://github.com/ergonlogic/ansible-role-cloud/issues/4" TITLE : add ec2 keypair BODY : we can inject a public key into linodes directly when launching the instance. however, for ec2, this needs to be handled separately. i should still be able to pull in the user's public key, and create a key air based on that. once https://github.com/ergonlogic/ansible-role-admin-users runs, it should clean up the ones we inject during launch.
