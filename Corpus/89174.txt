 URL : "https://github.com/someara/kitchen-dokken/issues/63" TITLE : possible to sync folders? BODY : i know little about docker, but is it possible to sync folders into the running container like you can with kitchen vagrant? i want to load a library from my cookbook during a test, currently i run this in my spec_helper.rb: ruby load '/opt/kitchen/cookbooks/my_cookbook/libraries/my_library.rb' is there a better approach im not thinking of?
