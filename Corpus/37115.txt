 URL : "https://github.com/spacejam/void/issues/11" TITLE : keybinds not working BODY : howdy! neat project. ive been giving it a go and have run into a snag with the custom keybinds. ive set the env var and pointed it to the default.keys found in this repo. it errors out with the below until i remove he lines for undo_delete and help : thread 'main' panicked at 'called result::unwrap on an err value: error { repr: custom custom { kind: other, error: stringerror invalid config at line 30: undo_delete:c-z } }', src/libcore/result.rs:860 note: run with rust_backtrace=1 for a backtrace. removing those gets it to launch, but the app still responds to the default bindings and does not appear to notice any changes i make. have you run into this before?
