 URL : "https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-cli/issues/517" TITLE : export to uvision 5 BODY : i have been trying to get the bluetooth hr demo to work with keil - https://github.com/armmbed/mbed-os-example-ble using a nucleo f401 + idb05a1 ble board, i can confirm building with the cli using mbed compile works fine - the hr example works as expected and i can view the data on an iphone etc. however.... when i export the project to uvision5 using mbed export -i uvision5 and build+deploy using uvision, the project builds+deploys, but does not function correctly no advertised bt device + on board led flashes too fast as well . i am using the same arm compiler packaged with uvision in both cases, yet there still seems to be a difference here. is there a way to ensure they use the exact same compiler settings, or is there another issue i am not aware of?
