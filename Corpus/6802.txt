BODY : i'm a new user and i must be missing something. i'm trying to map a button on my normal mouse to a simple undo command cmd+z . i can't seem to manage how to do it. my other buttons got mapped to other keyboard sequences just fine. the keyboard shortcut recording won't record cmd+z specifically because it's being used by btt as its undo. and i can't find anywhere to create a custom keyboard sequence that i can use as a predefined action. i've tried pressing cmd+shift+z, and then right clicking to cut the shift, but that doesn't work. i've tried pressing cmd+ and another letter besides z , and then selecting the other letter and typing z to replace it, but that doesn't work either. this has to be easier than this, right? what am i doing wrong? device information: type of mac: mac pro 5,1 macos version: high sierra latest update bettertouchtool version: 2.318
