 URL : "https://github.com/polsys/Ref/issues/2" TITLE : new entry type: web site BODY : this needs some working out, because references are typically to single web pages. however it would be nice to group the site as one. the pages should therefore have a key in addition to the url, and be exported along with some data from the site entry. i'm not sure how the current page infrastructure will handle that.
