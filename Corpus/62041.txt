 URL : "https://github.com/davorf/BlackBeanControl/issues/19" TITLE : can't learn dish remote BODY : i don't know how i missed your comments on issue 14, but i can not learn that remote with the script nor the original app. i think that is why the original app has that remote as a built-in. any idea how to proceed? what if i get you network dumps of the original/working app remote in use. could you make a config based on that?
