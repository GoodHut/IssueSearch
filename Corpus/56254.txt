 URL : "https://github.com/jrief/django-websocket-redis/issues/231" TITLE : mobile client question BODY : hello, first thank you for this great library. i just came across it. i have successfully ran the demo project on my local box and am now trying to change it to suit my requirements, which basically are; a django rest api which communicates with mobile clients via an authorization token in the header via various endpoints. what i am trying to do now is to implement a chat interface between any 2 users as the following; 1. user post's a message to an endpoint with request data like so; { user : john , message : hello world } inside the view i am sending the message like so; redis_publisher = redispublisher facility='foobar', users= user_obj message = redismessage message redis_publisher.publish_message message now this works in combination with the demo project a logged in user will receive this . the problem is on my mobile client end. i want to open a websocket on the client to subscribe to messages for that particular user when user auth is all happening via rest. is there something i can do similar to ws://127.0.0.1:8000/ws/foobar?subscribe-user-<user-id> ? thanks in advance.
