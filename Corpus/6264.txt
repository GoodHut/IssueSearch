 URL : "https://github.com/flawcode/flawcode-website/issues/58" TITLE : a better player BODY : right now the mobile version of the website does not render the player in a good way. to check this just go to flawcode.com through any mobile browser and you will notice that you can barely see the player. perhaps we need a better player or some css changes. anything to make the player more usable will be helpful. thanks.
