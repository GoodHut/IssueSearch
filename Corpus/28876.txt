 URL : "https://github.com/linuxmint/xviewer/issues/34" TITLE : image smoothing bug BODY : image smoothing when zooming in is not working correctly. steps to reproduce: - create simple image with simple colors in your favorite image editor. i created red, green and blue areas. - open image in xviewer. - go to edit/preferences and make sure smooth images when zoomed in check-box is checked. - zoom in enough so you can see borders of pixels. actual behavior: - you can see darker border between areas. see this http://imgur.com/a/00zun link. expected behavior: - you should see nice transition between colors. possible cause and solution: there is probably some blurring effect applied on encoded data, not on brightness values. you can read more about this here http://blog.johnnovak.net/2016/09/21/what-every-coder-should-know-about-gamma/ . it doesn't look good, and it also feels wrong. it's like trying to add a to encrypted b - result after decryption won't be a+b . transforming rgb encoded pixels is less destructive, but still wrong.
