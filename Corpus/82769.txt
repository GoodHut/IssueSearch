 URL : "https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/ark-desktop/issues/355" TITLE : ark desktop wallet update BODY : hey guys has anyone had a issue updating desktop wallet? i had the previous desktop wallet and clicked on the github link and followed the download instructions. after the new update installed it gave me a error that i didn't have administrative access? the ark desktop icon was a generic image and didn't even load the logo. i tried to reinstall the same update again no luck. i then uninstall the program and try to reinstall but same issue. i'm on windows vista if that makes any difference. it worked fine before. once i uninstall the only file left is a locked administrator file in the ark folder.. i'm lost anything would be a help. thanks
