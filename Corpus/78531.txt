 URL : "https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga/issues/744" TITLE : put.resolve not blocking BODY : i have having some problems trying to initiating a blocking put . basically i am trying to ensure a second request is fired only after the first request completes. the code pseudocode looks something like this: javascript function firstasync payload { try { const response = yield call api.post, payload ; yield put finishfirst response ; } catch error {} } export function first { while true { const actionpayload = yield take start_first ; yield call firstasync, action } } function secondasync payload { try { const response = yield call api.post, payload ; yield put finishsecond response ; } catch error {} } function firstthensecond payload { // startfirst is the action creator for const start_first yield put.resolve startfirst payload ; yield call secondasync, payload ; } export function somesaga { yield takelatest first_then_second, firstthensecond ; } the behavior should be somesaga -> firstthensecond -> first -> firstasync -> secondasync but secondasync is finishes before firstasync . would appreciate if anyone can help point me in the right direction.
