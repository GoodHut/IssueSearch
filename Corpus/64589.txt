 URL : "https://github.com/ParadiseSS13/Paradise/issues/8340" TITLE : greys can detect ghosts BODY : problem description : not a problem with greys in particular, i think. it's just that telepathy apparently has nearby ghosts, including said ghost's name in the list of people you can target with it. what did you expect to happen : i am unsure if this is it working as intended or not, but i figured it might be best to check. why is this bad/what are the consequences: opens the door to some metagaming shenanigans, as ghosts can just hang out near greys/the geneticists and wait for them to notice there's a ghost and know exactly who to look for on the crew monitor. steps to reproduce the problem : have a ghost near you when you use telepathy.
