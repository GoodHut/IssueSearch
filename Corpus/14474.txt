 URL : "https://github.com/kentcdodds/glamorous-website/issues/77" TITLE : api -> typescript BODY : learn how to set up the project here https://github.com/kentcdodds/glamorous-website/blob/master/contributing.md and how docs work here https://github.com/kentcdodds/glamorous-website/blob/master/other/contributing_documentation.md . for much of this you should be able to do everything without even cloning the project. you could just do it in the github editor https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/ ! - existing docs: https://github.com/paypal/glamorous/blob/master/other/typescript_usage.md - destination: https://github.com/kentcdodds/glamorous-website/blob/master/pages/api/content/typescript.js anyone can work on this just comment here when you're going to start . feel free to improve the existing docs if you're copying them over it doesn't have to be a direct copy/paste if feel you can improve upon them . thanks!
