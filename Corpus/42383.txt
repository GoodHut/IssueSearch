 URL : "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/issues/7328" TITLE : avoid the use of goto BODY : using goto is a terrible programming practice. there might been some benefits for using in the core code i cannot see any , but for god sake do not use it in the examples. the file that caught my attention is riot/blob/master/examples/gcoap/gcoap_cli.c which in line 139 has a goto statememt, which can be simply replaced with the code under the label end: only two lines .
