 URL : "https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl/issues/59" TITLE : adaptivity with mvectors BODY : adaptivity with mvectors has a commented out test: https://github.com/juliadiffeq/ordinarydiffeq.jl/blob/master/test/static_array_tests.jl l9 when i got staticarrays working, i believe i commented that out since i had to go work on other v0.6 upgrades, but this should get looked at. something is turning into an svector for some reason.
