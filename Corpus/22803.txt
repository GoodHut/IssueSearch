 URL : "https://github.com/VFansss/mgs2-v-s-fix/issues/15" TITLE : missing game audio BODY : thanks to this patch, the game is finally working. but i'm missing the music and voice audio. the sound effects of, for example, the main menu and codec call sound is working, but there are no voices or music. i've reinstalled the game multiple times and checked the options to see if the sound was actually on, but both didn't work. is there a fix for this yet?
