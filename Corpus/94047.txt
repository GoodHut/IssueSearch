 URL : "https://github.com/rannn505/node-powershell/issues/22" TITLE : better error passing to js BODY : given a simple throw whoops in powershell the message whoops at line:2 char:5 + throw whoops + ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ + categoryinfo : operationstopped: whoops:string , runtimeexception + fullyqualifiederrorid : whoops gets passed along to the js. it would be much easier to handle custom exceptions and display messages in the js/frontend side if the exception object was serialized and passed from ps->js. on the js side, i may want to use the message, error id, line number, script name, etc. try { throw whoops } catch { $_ | convertto-json } with the above example, you mainly rely on the $_.exception.message or $_.message some projects, pester for instance, use a custom function to make their own error id. take the following: function new-errorrecord string $errorid, string $message, hashtable $custom { $errorcategory = management.automation.errorcategory ::invalidresult $exception = new-object exception $message $errorrecord = new-object management.automation.errorrecord $exception, $errorid, $errorcategory, $custom $errorrecord } try { throw new-errorrecord -errorid crap.its.friday -message you probably shouldn't do this today. } catch { $_ | convertto-json } now you can use: $_.fullyqualifiederrorid $_.message to get the type and message.
