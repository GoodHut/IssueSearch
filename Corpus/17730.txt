 URL : "https://github.com/voidqk/sink/issues/19" TITLE : remove @ calling? BODY : what is the point of @ calling? seems unnecessary and could be removed. functions cannot be stored in variables, so currying is impossible, which would be the primary use case for @ calling... if there is a need for dynamic arguments, just code it as a list in the first place. i used to have @ calling because it was free, but after issue 17 's changes, it is no longer free. might as well remove it?
