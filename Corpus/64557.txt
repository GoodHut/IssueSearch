 URL : "https://github.com/UniFormal/TGView/issues/21" TITLE : granularity view in ui. BODY : we have or could have soon graphs of different granularity, we have the theory graph, which is the default target, potentially clustered graphs that could be shown when we zoom out finer-grained graphs like the symbol graph or a statement graph. there may even be more granularity levels and we should have an ui that allows this granularity zoon this zoom is definitely a different dimension than the built-in zoom we have now. apart from the fact that i think an ui like that would be very useful, i have no clear idea what we want, so we should discuss here.
