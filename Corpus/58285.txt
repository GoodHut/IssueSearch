 URL : "https://github.com/ashleymcnamara/gophers/issues/6" TITLE : separate space gophers BODY : i've put together this screensaver of twirling space gophers, inspired by the video loops at the 2017 gophercon. https://github.com/apiarian/space-gophers . but it would be 1000x more fabulous if there were more space gophers that could be used. unfortunately i'm quite inept at image editing, so i wouldn't trust myself to try to split the various existing space gopher images. could you please add some separated space gophers to this repo?
