 URL : "https://github.com/dlenski/vpn-slice/issues/2" TITLE : implied security risks BODY : hi, thank you for this ! works perfectly ^^ this is more a question than an issue. i am noob with routing/networking so i was wondering if you could explain what risks, if any, i am taking by using vpn-slice. can my network admin who provides the vpn identify that i have exposed the private network ? it would be great if you could point me to some attack that could be done which would compromise the private network so that i can learn how to protect against it. many thanks for making this so easy to use !
