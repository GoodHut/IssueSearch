 URL : "https://github.com/thednp/bootstrap.native/issues/126" TITLE : collapsible accordion bug BODY : i was receiving an error when using a collapsible accordion where the collapsible item had a data-target instead of an href. line 95 of v4/collapse.native.js reads as follows: correspondingcollapse = alltoggles u getattribute datatarget || alltoggles u .href; since getattribute is a function, not an object, it should read as follows: correspondingcollapse = alltoggles u getattribute datatarget || alltoggles u .href;
