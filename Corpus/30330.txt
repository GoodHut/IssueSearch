 URL : "https://github.com/shaun-edwards/packml/issues/5" TITLE : packml mode support BODY : the packml standard envisions multiple state machines modes that are managed by a mode manager. each mode/state machine represents a subset of the full packml state machine for specific uses ex: automatic, manual, maintenance, etc... the current implementation of the gui/statemachine does not support mode switching. however, it can be easily added, since all that is require is a mode manager that switched between state machines. only one state machine can be executing at once. all others must be stopped/idle.
