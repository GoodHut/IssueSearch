 URL : "https://github.com/kshoji/USB-MIDI-Driver/issues/63" TITLE : sysex not working BODY : hi. i'm unable to use system exclusive on any android device. all of the standard midi works fine, and sending sysex is fine, but the sysex response is missing bytes. i've tested on emulators and hardware using android 4,5,6 and 7. when expecting a sysex reply of 144 bytes, it often returns 141. the 3 missing bytes are at the start. it's completely random, so sometimes it gives an incorrect response immediately, other times after no more than 5 correct responses. i've tried increasing the thread priority in the midiinuptdevice file, changing the sleep time, and increasing the ready buffer size, to no avail. the comments and suggestions in this issues https://github.com/kshoji/usb-midi-driver/issues/58 doesn't help. is sysex given less priority than standard midi messages? if so, how do i get the sysex messages to use the same priority? i only need sysex, so i'd like it to be the main priority. thanks
