 URL : "https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/2450" TITLE : networking cni or weave? BODY : reading the networking docs https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/networking.md , it is not clear whether i should have yaml networking: weave: {} in my cluster.yml file or yaml networking: cni: {} and then run kubectl create -f https://git.io/weave-kube . anyone mind explaining the difference between both approaches?
