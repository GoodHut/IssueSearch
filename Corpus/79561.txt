 URL : "https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix/issues/535" TITLE : slow compilation of scss BODY : i experienced a significant performance decrease with scss compilation when moving from elixir to mix. i wanted to ask if anyone has the same issue? i do not have one project where i can test the performance of both solutions but i have quite similar setup on two different. the main difference is vuejs version but the js compilation is quite fast for both. on both projects i use bootstrap 3 and here are some numbers: laravel mix without watching: - whole process: 45 seconds - only scss compilation js commented out : 37 seconds laravel mix with watching: - initial full compilation with js : 36 seconds - scss and js recompilation: 16 seconds - initial scss only compilation: 32 seconds - only scss recompilation: 15 seconds just a notice: all of the 15-16 seconds of scss recompilation, the console output is stuck at: 10% building modules 0/1 modules 1 active ...crm_cc\resources\assets\sass\app.scss laravel elixir without watching: - whole process: sass 1.84s, webpack 8.8s, all 11s - only scss compilation: 1.89s laravel elixir with watching: - initial full compilation: 1.26s - scss and js recompilation: ~40ms elixir doesn't show webpack compilation time - initial scss only compilation: ~600ms - only scss recompilation: 30-40ms the changes i did to make it recompile was to add or remove one empty line either in app.scss or app.js . i tried one project with bulma framework and the compilation was a little bit faster but it's still ages compared to what i experienced with elixir. if you want me to investigate this further, i can setup two identical projects and test it properly. versions: - node: 6.9.5 - npm: 3.10.10 - elixir: 6.0.0-15 - mix: 0.8.8 recently updated from 0.5. with no difference in performance - node-sass: 3.13.1 for elixir, 4.5.0 for mix - os: windows 10 running yarn run watch or npm run watch makes no difference, but if it helps i have yarn@0.21.3
