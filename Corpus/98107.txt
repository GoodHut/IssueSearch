 URL : "https://github.com/google/grumpy/issues/273" TITLE : importing stdlib functions BODY : is there a reason why only some of the files from https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/master/lib have been copied to the thirdparty/stdlib folder? i was looking at the feature map from https://github.com/google/grumpy/wiki/missing-features, which makes it seem like a lot of the features would be covered in duplicating most of the cpython lib files.
