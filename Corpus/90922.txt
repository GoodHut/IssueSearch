 URL : "https://github.com/informatics-isi-edu/ermrestjs/issues/516" TITLE : support array column type BODY : apis that are dealing with representing data can easily support array data type. but the apis that are doing more with data filter, change, etc. needs more logic to specifically handle array data types. this issue came up while working on array data types in faceting related apis. we're showing the data as we expect, but cannot filter based on those columns.
