 URL : "https://github.com/dkun7944/pitch-ios/issues/1" TITLE : ipod touch 6 BODY : the ipod touch 6 has very spotty accuracy with the tuning app. i love the interface, but it's just inaccurate with my device. i've tried installing and reinstalling, updating, and nothing. very rarely does it stick to telling me whether a sustained note is in tune or not. i'd really appreciate it if you could check into this to see if the issue can be fixed.
