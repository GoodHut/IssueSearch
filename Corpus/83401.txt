 URL : "https://github.com/ross/requests-futures/issues/48" TITLE : cancellation not working? BODY : i'm reading the example python from requests_futures.sessions import futuressession with futuressession max_workers=1 as session: future = session.get 'https://httpbin.org/get' future2 = session.get 'https://httpbin.org/delay/10' future3 = session.get 'https://httpbin.org/delay/10' response = future.result such that there a three requests on one worker, but really only one result is expected, so two of the futures get canceled. hence, the above code snipped should take just about as long as python from requests_futures.sessions import futuressession with futuressession max_workers=1 as session: future = session.get 'https://httpbin.org/get' response = future.result i noticed however that it takes as long as python from requests_futures.sessions import futuressession with futuressession max_workers=1 as session: future = session.get 'https://httpbin.org/get' future2 = session.get 'https://httpbin.org/delay/10' future3 = session.get 'https://httpbin.org/delay/10' response = future.result response2 = future2.result response3 = future3.result in other words: the remaining futures do _not_ get canceled. perhaps a misunderstanding on my side?
