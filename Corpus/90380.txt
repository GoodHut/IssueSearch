 URL : "https://github.com/tedplumtree/Darlcha/issues/8" TITLE : set up 4xx error document BODY : story as a user, if i hit a non-existent page on the website, i want to see a friendly error page, instead of the s3 default implementation details > for example, when an http 404 not found error occurs, google chrome might ignore the error document that amazon s3 returns and display its own error. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazons3/latest/dev/customerrordocsupport.html does this mean we can't do this?
