BODY : i know there are a couple of object where i _think_ the repr can get some improvements. plain-text or pretty, i don't really care, but i think we can do a better job. i'll try to add them here when i encounter one. bytes. now that we are python 3 only, i think for educational and teaching purpose we should change the repr of bytes. i believe that the leading b is not enough of a hint to mark that bytes are bytes. i i believe is the bytes representation were <bytes b'deadbeef...0124' at 0x123456> or similar it would be much help with bytes vs string debate. plus this would allow to avoid accidently printing image bytes which can screw up the notebook.
