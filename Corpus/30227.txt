 URL : "https://github.com/blockstack/designs/issues/384" TITLE : ongaku ryoho design BODY : hey folks, i just refined the design and onboarding experience for http://ongakuryoho.com i was wondering what everyone thought and what could possibly be improved? even if it's something super small or stupid, let me know! stuff like: - what do you think of the onboarding experience? did everything make sense? - do all the icons match the actual subject? - what do you think about the font colors? is everything readable enough? or even: - please redesign this whole section ... - please remove this entirely, this doesn't make sense ... ps. it looks best in chrome and safari. firefox does something really weird with the font line-height ðŸ˜ž
