 URL : "https://github.com/davidhrbaty/ArduBot/issues/3" TITLE : unable to work it out BODY : i followed all steps, was able to assemble using 3d printed parts, but robot doesn't work when program is uploaded. i got the latest files from irremote and added as library. the servos seem to hum and ir receiver light blinks when i press buttons on my lg remote. i disconnected and tested each components separately servos, ultrasonic module and all seem to work independently using smaller sample programs. am i doing something wrong? thanks
