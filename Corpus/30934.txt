 URL : "https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-pattern-validator/issues/6" TITLE : remove pcre grammar BODY : it is more difficult to validate regex literals now that they no longer have a special syntax. it also creates the question of how far down the validation rabbit hole we want to go. base64? hex? ip addresses? for now, we should keep the validator simple and remove special-purpose pcre validation.
