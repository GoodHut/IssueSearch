 URL : "https://github.com/ccd0/4chan-x/issues/1530" TITLE : replace you beep. BODY : the you beep is way too loud and even if it wasn't, it's horrid. i've yet to not get startled from it. could someone please either replace it with something better -a sound that actually fades in instead of just starting at max level would be ideal-, or add an option to change it's volume or select another sound instead?
