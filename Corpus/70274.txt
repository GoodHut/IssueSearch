 URL : "https://github.com/BiologicalRecordsCentre/Pantheon/issues/160" TITLE : user stats for pantheon BODY : jim's initial thoughts as to how these might be tackled and a rough idea of time : •	number of visitors: google analytics – an hour if not already in place •	number of new accounts: drupal view – an hour assuming you mean drupal accounts – be aware of spam accounts. •	how long they stay: google analytics up to a point http://help.analyticsedge.com/googleanalytics/misunderstood-metrics-time-on-page-session-duration/ •	how many samples loaded: indicia report – an hour or two •	how many species loaded: indicia report •	how many downloads from the analyses – google analytics possibly https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1012044?hl=en •	what area does the user work in – drupal user profile plus drupal view – an hour but may only gather information about new users •	what pantheon is being used for – is this an extension of the previous point? it is also possible to introduce questionnaires rather than using the drupal user profile to gather information. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqyx-zv5ezc not sure if that offers any particular advantage here. looks like pretty easy requirements at first glance although that is a pretty superficial estimate.
