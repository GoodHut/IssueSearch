 URL : "https://github.com/CategoricalData/fql/issues/89" TITLE : implement q^f and q_f BODY : given an aql mapping f : t -> s, the functor delta_f : s-inst -> t-inst is naturally isomorphic to: - the functor eval q^f : s-inst -> t-inst for some query q^f : s -> t - the functor co-eval q_f : s-inst -> t-inst for some query q_f : t -> s both queries q^f and q_f are described in 4.3.4 of “algebraic data integration”. i would like the aql tool to automatically construct them.
