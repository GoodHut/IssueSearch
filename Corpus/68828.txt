 URL : "https://github.com/bokmann/font-awesome-rails/issues/193" TITLE : simple font subsetting? BODY : my application only uses a few symbols from font awesome, and the font is one of the largest required components in the critical path. it'd be great if i could just list the symbols i want, and font-awesome-rails would then create a subset file with only those fonts. i imagine that there's a way to do that using the rails asset pipeline, but i didn't see simple step-by-step instructions on how to do this. there may not even need to be any more code; this may be just please document step-by-step instructions on how to do this . i imagine many people only use a small subset of font awesome, and since fonts are typically on the critical path for display, it's nice to make them smaller. thanks so much!!
