 URL : "https://github.com/osresearch/heads/issues/115" TITLE : heads license is unclear BODY : please can a license be chosen and added to the repository? i think the license would have to be gplv2 compatible https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html gplcompatiblelicenses because heads builds include a linux kernel, but ianal. best of all would to license heads under agplv3+ or at least gplv3+, to maximize the chance of downstream improvements being made available to the community, for integration upstream.
