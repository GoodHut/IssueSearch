 URL : "https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/1703" TITLE : injecting data from server BODY : our docs explain how to inject data from the server https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/readme.md injecting-data-from-the-server-into-the-page , but this doesn't translate well to development. i think we should expand the docs to explain what to do in development or add means of specifying these values in development mode. ! https://puu.sh/uqvut/424d139569.png
