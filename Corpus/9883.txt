BODY : there is no way that i'm aware of that you can get the mouse delta, for moving things according to mouse motion. using current_mouse_pos - last_mouse_pos is problematic once the mouse is captured or hits the screen edges. this is how i had to solve it, which is a bit weird: https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/72j6vu/getting_mouse_delta/?st=j81hx23v&sh=fbffabee example: global_position.x += input.get_mouse_delta .x
