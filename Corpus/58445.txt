 URL : "https://github.com/vgteam/toil-vg/issues/399" TITLE : simulated calling test BODY : want easy way to tack calling results onto simulated mapping results. one way would be option to chain calling and vcfeval onto mapeval. other woudl be to break out into script that calls both in series. in either case, all the toil functions should already be present in toil-vg. the main concern is that simulated calling tests will need much higher coverage than we're currently giving the mapping tests, so i don't think we'll get anything chromosome-sized into jenkins unless we store gams. but it would be very feasible to do in the context of something like compare-graphs.sh.
