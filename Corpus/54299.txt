 URL : "https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc/issues/605" TITLE : folders created by nyc BODY : i've notices two things about the folders being created by nyc : 1. when executing a simple test with nyc mocha a ./coverage folder will be created, but without any stored file in it. if there is no output there should be simply no folder created! 2. since switching from istanbul to nyc there are additional files inside the ./.nyc_output folder. they seems to be needed to use for things like nyc report . but why the heck is there a need of another folder in the rood directory? you already create the ./coverage folder. so if there is any need of files for code coverage report it should be placed in that folder. maybe like ./coverage/nyc_output . even better for .gitignore and old users of isanbul .
