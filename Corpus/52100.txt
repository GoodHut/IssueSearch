 URL : "https://github.com/maddevsio/openfreecab-storage/issues/1" TITLE : can't start the webapp BODY : hi first of all, thanks for sharing this project, it's awesome! for some reason, after i run './openfreecab-storage,' it gives me the following error. <img width= 1273 alt= screenshot src= https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8204913/23158143/e5d63e2a-f7d2-11e6-8f9f-762663af492f.png > the only two changes i made is to comment out 'github.com/labstack/echo/engine/standard' in the http.go and change line 49 to 'h.e.start h.os.config .httpbindaddr ' as the echo library has changed.
