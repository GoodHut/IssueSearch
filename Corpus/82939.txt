 URL : "https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn/issues/487" TITLE : batch size of faster rcnn BODY : can someone please confirm if i understand this right? in one training iteration you only feed the network with 1 or 2 images but with 128 or 256 gt labels. so essentially one minibatch only has 1 or 2 images. i was skeptical because in other examples of neural networks i have seen a batch size typically 64. any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. thanks;
