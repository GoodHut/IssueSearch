 URL : "https://github.com/ToddGreenfield/homebridge-onkyo/issues/1" TITLE : zone 2 support BODY : hi, thanks for working on this, it's the missing piece for my home automation i think. if you had zone 2 support it would be perfect. should be easy enough to add, i read over the eiscp docs, it should be just a matter of prefixing all the commands you send with either main: or zone2:. then all you'd need to do is add some config so the user can specify the zone. if you're not already working on it i'm happy to test and contribute a fix. thanks
