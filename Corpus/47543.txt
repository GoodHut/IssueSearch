 URL : "https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/issues/1604" TITLE : plugin api c library. BODY : i have ambivalent feelings about kak plugin systems. the bad part imo is shell scripting. a shell is a terrible tool. it sucks. it is a convenient way to glue together a bunch of programs or do some basic automation. the good part imo is being based on elegant input/output system, where plugins are basically sending keystrokes to kak process. however the problem with that is that it requires a good knowledge of kak keystrokes . anyway, what i'd like to ask for is a simple c library that can be used as to build kak plugins without being an expert in driving kak behavior from the keyboard. something that i could call: kak_display_message plugin is ready ; kak_flush ; and it would convert it to a necessary writes to stdout or arbitrary file descriptor . this way: i can write complex kakoune plugins, in a programming language of my choice; i personally would build rust wrappers over that api, but anyone can use their own favourite language just fine; by looking at the api, i have some discoverability of what i can do in kakoune, without being an expert already. i have some type-checking, so i can easily modify my plugin to work with any new versions of kak , by just making them compile again.
