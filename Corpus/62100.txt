 URL : "https://github.com/bnosac/image/issues/2" TITLE : cannot detect anything. BODY : after having installed image.darknet i tried to carry out the model using the weights trained on coco , just copying the code and nothing else. that said, i gave input a very simple object to detect it was a sweetie cat , but the output has been the following: c:/ / / / /cat.jpg: predicted in 5.22000 seconds. boxes: 845 of which 0 above the threshold. after that i have tried with some other images whose content were bottles, dogs, so i guess the model shouldn't have any problem to detect them correctly since the coco model provides the possibility to detect thoso labels. so i suppose that i am missing something critical. any help? thanks in advance for your answers!
