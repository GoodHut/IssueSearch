 URL : "https://github.com/sabnzbd/sabnzbd/issues/960" TITLE : rar 5.5.5 upgrade pls BODY : seems like every version less than 5.5.5 got some problems. https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1286&desc=6 given the wide prevalence of the unrar source code in third-party software, quite a few downstream parties will be affected. the source code with the fixes can be found under http://www.rarlab.com/rar/unrarsrc-5.5.5.tar.gz - downstream parties are encouraged to quickly update and ship fixes.
