 URL : "https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-collector-chef-cookbook/issues/140" TITLE : chef 13 compatibility BODY : this is just a question rather than an issue. i see that commit https://github.com/sumologic/sumologic-collector-chef-cookbook/commit/37f20fede75d1d4f732e8264129106f411e3514e enables chef 13 compatibility. just wondering if a tagged release including that commit is planned any time soon? thanks.
