 URL : "https://github.com/Esri/resource-proxy/issues/444" TITLE : support for asp.net core BODY : we started to use asp.net core with the latest esri javascript fw 4.x to build custom apps . this means the current implementation of the proxy page as request handler which is no more supported in asp.net core and replaced by middleware, won't work . did you guys think about the change in microsoft space classic vs core and come up with a newer version of the proxy that works as a middleware ? if so when do you think that you can provide customers with a version that works on the asp.net core framework ? thanks,
