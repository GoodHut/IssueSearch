 URL : "https://github.com/fabriziocucci/yacl4j/issues/5" TITLE : save config to file BODY : i found this project when i was searching for a library to handle yaml configurations for mediathekview/mserver https://github.com/mediathekview/mserver . the configuration reading works really fine and i'm very glad with it. but i'm very sad about the fact, there is no option to save a changed configuration back to a yaml file. please add support for writing the configuration back to yaml.
