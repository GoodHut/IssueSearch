 URL : "https://github.com/ercius/openNCEM/issues/8" TITLE : matlab code location BODY : i forget during the discussion we had in person when creating this repo, but are we going to split the top level folder structure into python and matlab folders such that there are only two top level folders and the few necessary text files .gitignore, readme, license ? this would require moving docs, tools, and ncempy into a python folder and updating any necessary cross-references. on the other hand, we could leave things the way they are and only add a specific matlab folder. tom
