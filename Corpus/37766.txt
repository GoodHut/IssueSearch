BODY : currently there are these zoom/pan modes, that i can figure out: - lmb-drag: pan - mmb-drag: pan - mousewheel: zoom - axis lmb-drag: pan single axis - axis mwl zom single axis. it would be really nice to be able to use a few more of the pan and zoom modes http://www.pyqtgraph.org/documentation/mouse_interaction.html d-graphics available in pyqtgraph, specifically: - lmb-drag: change this to the drag-a-rectange-and-zoom-to-that mode this mode is better for single-button users, more familiar for matplotlib users, and the current functionality duplicated anyway - rmb-drag: scale the scene on each axis independently - axis lmb-drag: if in the direction of the axis, normal behaviour, if in the perpendicular direction, then scale the axis instead. e.g. on the x axis, lmb click and dragging left and right will pan left and right as normal, dragging up will zoom in, and draggin down will zoom out. on the y axis, dragging right would zoom in maintaining the towards the plot is inwards mapping , and left would zoom out. this behaviour is like the drag behaviour in ableton, and is really quick and intuitive once you get used to it. the first two of these are already available in pyqtgraph, the first one just needs to be turned on - i'm not sure why the second is not working. the third option probably needs new functionlity in pyqtgraph, but i though i'd post this here first and check. this is some really nice software. i've been looking for something like this for ages : both
