 URL : "https://github.com/maloep/romcollectionbrowser/issues/311" TITLE : deprecate import dialog BODY : ideally we should remove the import dialog option since many of the controls are handled by the addon's settings. in addition we should aspire to kodi-like importing experience where we don't have a further dialog before importing, and importing occurs in the background. the only caveat is that for mame collections we should be deferring to local file scrapers rather than online scrapers in order to reduce the network impact and api key quota .
