 URL : "https://github.com/OrionFive/Hospitality/issues/12" TITLE : feature: guest areas BODY : the player should be able to create an area for guests, which can be assigned through the guest tab. this will allow to mark where guests can get joy, buy things, sleep, etc. it will have to be hooked up to their think tree so they will not perform actions outside their area e.g. eat from the player's fridge . there should be a fallback behavior if the player did not specify an area. e.g. default being the home zone.
