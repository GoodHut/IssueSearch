 URL : "https://github.com/LuckyGeck/YcmdCompletion/issues/30" TITLE : goto definition via f12 BODY : hi, i managed to install everything and i think it's working. the feature that made me have this is go to typedef . however, if i press f12 on a mytype_t , nothing happens and the status bar indicates unable to find mytype_t . but if i run ycmd: goto definition from the command palette, then it correctly goes to the definition. any idea why ? can i set up ycmd to work with f12 ? thank you! ciprian
