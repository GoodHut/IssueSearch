 URL : "https://github.com/GENIVI/rvi_lib/issues/24" TITLE : inconsistent coding style BODY : seems the coding style is not consistent on certain things: some functions are named with camelcase which is more a c++ convension and others are named with lower case and underscores. i'd stick with one convention strictly and i recommend choosing the usual c conventions of using camelcase only for structures/types. then there is spacing: some function declarations have lots of spacing in them, while others don't.
