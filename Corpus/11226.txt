BODY : hello. i'd like to ask you to allow bees to use flowers in pots. as i remember such future was already in previous version of forestry in minecraft 1.7.10 but i tried to do the same in minecraft 1.10.2 and failed. furthermore it will be great to have a special type of pots, which can contain any type of flowers/mushrooms/netherwart or any another plants which required for bees , cause vanilla pots can't be used for netherwarts.
