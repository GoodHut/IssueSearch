 URL : "https://github.com/Ovyerus/knife-bot/issues/20" TITLE : comply to new discord tos BODY : discord recently updated their tos which requires bot developers to get permission from users before storing data, as well as requiring encryption for user data, this includes user ids, and presumably guild ids as well. getting user consent will most likely have to be a command to give consent. since rethinkdb and redis do not appear to support database encryption, so that will have to be handled by the bot somehow. i'm thinking of pgp, or maybe something based off sha-256.
