 URL : "https://github.com/LeonardoCiaccio/GrabAnyMedia/issues/6" TITLE : filtering url's BODY : not really an issue, was wondering if we might get a toggle on/off for the url filtering this extension does. i have not been into the workings very far but i would be more comfortable if it scanned/filtered only when i need it too. if you know what i mean.is something like that a possibility here?
