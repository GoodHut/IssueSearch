 URL : "https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/issues/1598" TITLE : refactor log messages BODY : this is quite a big issue and it has two parts. both will require checking all messages that are logged by golem. check that log messages shows meaningful information. for example the message fail to deserialize message is logged a lot. to make this message useful we should add more information. who send this message? can we add more info why we failed to deserialize this message? check that log severity is not too high. many of the messages that we log have too high severity, especially during the development period, when protocol changes are normal app behaviour and not some form exception. for example messages like fail to deserialize message are normal info and not a warning. when protocol is being changed, then it's normal that some messages will fail deserialization stage. we can increase severity of this log message, when protocol is more stable.
