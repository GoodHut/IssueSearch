 URL : "https://github.com/jdbi/jdbi/issues/981" TITLE : jdbi3 sqllog equivalent? BODY : i've been going through the entire javadoc but i can't seem to find a replacement mechanism for sqllog. i can see statementcontext has some get sql methods, but no replacement for dbi.setsqllog. timingcollector receives the statementcontext so it could technically be done in there, but that feels like a workaround given the interface's name.
