 URL : "https://github.com/FACG2/Pied-Piper-Autocomplete/issues/13" TITLE : confusingly name variables BODY : your variable names should be descriptive, and unique, such that it's easy to get a basic idea of the value of a variable before looking at it. a variable called countr https://github.com/facg2/pied-piper-autocomplete/blob/master/src/uniprocessor.js l2 doesn't tell me anything about what the value of the variable is, and isn't great, especially when you have an argument to a function called country https://github.com/facg2/pied-piper-autocomplete/blob/master/src/uniprocessor.js l18 in the same file. it would be easy to confuse these two, and make mistakes. when naming variables think: 1. what will the value of this variable be? 2. is the name i'm thinking of either already used in my code, or, very similar to a variable already in my code?
