 URL : "https://github.com/scrubs767/VsTrello/issues/7" TITLE : card update issues BODY : currently when a card is updated on trello, vstrello is notified about this and will show the new changes, however the library used to communicate with trello does not fire individual property changed events for card properties like attachments or checklists, so these are not getting updated when changes happen. i have an issue reported for the library, waiting to hear back.
