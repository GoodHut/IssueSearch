 URL : "https://github.com/cerner/terra-core/issues/839" TITLE : add .idea to .gitignore BODY : issue description jetbrains ide's rubymine, webstorm create a hidden directory .idea whenever you open a directory as a project. these files are workspace specific and should be ignored. because this is a monorepo, opening the whole entire repo in the ide usually just crashes the ide on slower machines. so i've been opening just the particular package i'm working on in webstorm, which means the .idea directory is in a subdirectory of the project. the expression .idea should solve this. issue type <!-- is this a new feature request, enhancement, bug report, other? --> - new feature - enhancement - bug - x other expected behavior after opening the project in any jetbrains ide, running git status should not show any .idea directory. after opening a subdirectory of the project in any jetbrains ide, running git status should not show any .idea directory. current behavior <!-- tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior --> <!-- leave a comment n/a if there is no current behavior --> after opening the project in any jetbrains ide, running git status currently shows the .idea directory. <!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------> <!-- if you are reporting a bug, please fill out the sections below. --> <!-- otherwise, the sections below can be deleted. --> <!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------> steps to reproduce 1. open project in any jetbrains ide 2. run git status
