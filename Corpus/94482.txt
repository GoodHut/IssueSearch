 URL : "https://github.com/electron/electron-rebuild/issues/143" TITLE : cannot locate node-gyp due BODY : as of commit 8f51c7ea179eef48232d9e93b77b9f9a370b3710, my copy of electron-forge is unable to start my application. it fails on trying to rebuild native dependencies saying it cannot located node-gyp. i dug around and traced the error back to the rebuild.js file in this project. i believe that because of how node-gyp is located after the above mentioned commit, it's triggering my problem. on arch linux and perhaps other linux systems with node v5.7.0 and npm 4.1.2, packages installed via npm install -g have their executable files sym-linked to /usr/bin/ instead of /usr/lib/node_modules/.bin , which is what electron-rebuild is looking for. more details are available on request.
