 URL : "https://github.com/schmittjoh/serializer/issues/733" TITLE : outdated docs site BODY : as i can see docs in the repository https://github.com/schmittjoh/serializer/blob/master/doc/reference/annotations.rst type say that datetimeinterface is a supported serialization type. at the same time, these docs http://jmsyst.com/libs/serializer/master/reference/annotations type say nothing about this type. may be it's time to rebuild docs site?
