 URL : "https://github.com/sagesharp/outreachy-django-wagtail/issues/10" TITLE : set up test server BODY : need to have a test server managed by dokku at test.outreachy.org. currently we're just crossing our fingers and pushing to production after local testing. ðŸ˜± ideally in the future we would set up a test server for each developer to push to. we need to have a way to copy the django database, scrub any personal data like email addresses . we could use django fixtures to define the models we want to test.
