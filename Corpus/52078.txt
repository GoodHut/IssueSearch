 URL : "https://github.com/jpgmoreira/Python-Pygame-RRT-Path-finder/issues/1" TITLE : can't open application BODY : outside the root directory i tried running python python-pygame-rrt-path-finder to get the error: /library/frameworks/python.framework/versions/2.7/resources/python.app/contents/macos/python: can't find '__main__' module in 'python-pygame-rrt-path-finder/' i tried changing the name __application__ in rrt path finder.py to application.py but that doesn't seem to work. i'm also new at this so it may just be i don't know what command to use and where to execute the main code. help/clarification would be greatly appreciated.
