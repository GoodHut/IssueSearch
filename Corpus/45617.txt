 URL : "https://github.com/beancount/fava/issues/581" TITLE : improve example files BODY : the example files on fava.pythonanywhere.com https://fava.pythonanywhere.com/ are a nice way to get an idea of what fava looks like. they could be improved though and show of some fava-specific features. that way they could also serve as a reference of what this would look like - for example with budgets, it's maybe not obvious from the documentation where they should show up. if there was an example file with budgets on pythonanywhere, this could simply be linked to if someone has an issue. i'll take one of the auto-generated example files as a base and add some budgets. anything else that should be added to show of one of fava's features? @aumayr: i discovered that the example files are not read-only, so anyone can edit them currently. i've updated the scripts to mark them read-only. can you run them to see if they work? i fixed some things that spellcheck complained about - i hope i didn't break them
