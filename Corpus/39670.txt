 URL : "https://github.com/Financial-Times/n-barriers/issues/57" TITLE : sort out this module BODY : this seems to exist in a vacuum, outside of the rest of the stack. it doesn't use our linting rules or anything else. if these styles are required globally this should move into financial-times/n-ui. if they are only used in next-product then they should be in there. if these barriers are used in other ft products then this should be handed over to the origami team
