 URL : "https://github.com/gbif/portal-feedback/issues/20" TITLE : i prefer the old map! BODY : i prefer the old map! the old map allowed for a rapid overview of the extent and data density of a species distribution. the hexagons in the new system are too large, and repeated in and out zooming is needed to achieve the same overview as before.
the initial map is also too small, especially if one is only trying rapidly gain an idea of multiple species tanges.
otherwise, looks cool, although it& 39;s a shame the gopher site doesn& 39;t work... ; -----
