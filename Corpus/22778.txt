 URL : "https://github.com/vthibault/roBrowser/issues/147" TITLE : minor skill issues BODY : the skill cloaking should not show a label cloaking!! the skill back sliding shouldn't display a skill use movement animation this was fixed a few months ago on rathena, since official servers don't show animation, the character is standing still when backsliding the skill sonic blow and cross impact can be chained infinitely no animation delay is applied , and since the server does not check animation delay, this can be used as a skill hack to do infinite combos.
