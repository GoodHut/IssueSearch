 URL : "https://github.com/lucko/LuckPerms/issues/459" TITLE : hack my server BODY : this configuration not proetect my server if the vanilla op system is enabled. if set to false, all users will be de-opped, and the op/deop commands will be disabled. enable-ops: false if set to true, any user with the permission luckperms.autoop will automatically be granted server operator status. this permission can be inherited, or set on specific servers/worlds, temporarily, etc. additionally, setting this to true will force the enable-ops option above to false. all users will be de-opped unless they have the permission node, and the op/deop commands will be disabled. it is important to note that this setting is only checked when a player first joins the server, and when they switch worlds. therefore, simply removing this permission from a user will not automatically de-op them. a player needs to relog to have the change take effect. it is recommended that you use this option instead of assigning a single ' ' permission. auto-op: false if opped players should be allowed to use luckperms commands. set to false to only allow users who have the permissions access to the commands commands-allow-op: false hacker used: /pt op <nick> and hacked my server you can fix it?
