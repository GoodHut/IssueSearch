 URL : "https://github.com/Marak/faker.js/issues/472" TITLE : don't import directories BODY : systemjs won't import index.js when given a directory name /systemjs/systemjs/issues/1308 , instead recommending a configuration rule for each directory in each module /systemjs/systemjs/issues/902 . there turns out to be a silly number of directory-name require s mostly under locales in this project which makes this approach painful. if all the require 'dirname' s were changed to require 'dirname/index' then both node and systemjs would be happy. i could probably write a one-off script to find and replace these, if you'd accept such a pr.
