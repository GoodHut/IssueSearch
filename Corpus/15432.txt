 URL : "https://github.com/ServUO/ServUO/issues/1699" TITLE : double slayer bug BODY : the cameo slayer are stacking with weapon slayer of the same time, it s not intended, for example if you are using an weapon undead slayer and a cameo undead, when you hit a undead mob you are hitting 400+ damage each hit. the it go above the 300% max damage rule too. url http://stratics.com/threads/slayer-weapons-and-talismans.110211/ /url specific slayer + superslayer stack but superslayer doesn t stack with superslayer. spider + arachnid stack
arachnid + arachnit doesn t stack but renember the 300% cap. so with a spider weapon + arachnid cameo you deal 300% of damage 200 + 100 without need any other mod anat, tatics, enemyofone in your character for example, but even if you use the damage can t go higher then the 300% cap. reported by: arielgomesb report thread: http://servuo.com/threads/double-slayer-bug.6615/
