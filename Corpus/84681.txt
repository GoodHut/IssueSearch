 URL : "https://github.com/mmorise/World/issues/35" TITLE : dio/stonemask vs. harvest BODY : hi, i've been testing the latest version of world via the codec_test example b and compared it with the analysis_synthesis a example. i found that b does not produce unvoiced sections for my samples except for the silence in the beginning while a does. interestingly, the resynthesis is fine - but training a synthesizer on those obviously results in fully voiced sentences. here is an example input wav: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0b2d9egvk27w3c2x0qnvyrnvwlws then the f0 trajectory generated by a : https://drive.google.com/open?id=0b2d9egvk27w3ohnbafhsqmhnyw8 produced by: ./analysis input.wav a.f0 a.sp a.ap x2x +da a.f0 > a.f0.ascii and by b : https://drive.google.com/open?id=0b2d9egvk27w3delsmtbfrwlgs1u please note that i didn't prune the header here, so the first 3 lines can be ignored. produced by: ./f0analysis input.wav -o b.f0 x2x +da b.f0 > b.f0.ascii so i'm missing the unvoiced sections in b , or am i missing something here? thanks! markus
