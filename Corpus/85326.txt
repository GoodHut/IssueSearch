 URL : "https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/issues/2232" TITLE : exact reproducibility bug BODY : summary: exact reproducibility is not given when warmup is enabled. description: output from the sampler is not exactly the same when starting it on the same platform with the exact same seed. this happens whenever warmup is performed. when warmup=0 then the stan program is again exactly reproducible. reproducible steps: attached is a zip file containing an example which used clang on mac. the problem also happens when using gcc 6 with cmdstan. normal_exact_repo_bug.zip https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/files/776911/normal_exact_repo_bug.zip current output: the current output. knowing what is the current behavior is useful. expected output: it must be exactly reproducible regardless if warmup was performed or not. additional information: provide any additional information here. clang version: apple llvm version 8.0.0 clang-800.0.42.1 target: x86_64-apple-darwin16.4.0 thread model: posix g++ version: g++-mp-6 macports gcc6 6.3.0_0 6.3.0 current version: v2.14.0
