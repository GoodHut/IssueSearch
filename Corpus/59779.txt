 URL : "https://github.com/laravel/homestead/issues/757" TITLE : use of hyperv provider BODY : in our company, we're using both vagrant and docker, it is currently an internal and overly opinionated pain for those that aren't devops. so in order to use docker for windows we all had to update to windows 10 pro to use hyper-v but to use vagrant we need to turn off hyper-v. enabling and disabling hyper-v on windows 10 pro requires a mandatory restart as windows needs to perform an update in either direction. is it possible to use the hyperv provider as an option with laravel homestead so vagrant and docker can be running, without so much conflict and not require shutting down and restarting each time hyper-v is required or not required?
