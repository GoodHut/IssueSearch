 URL : "https://github.com/evansd/whitenoise/issues/156" TITLE : path_info is optional BODY : just had a request throw a keyerror from whitenoise.__call__ https://github.com/evansd/whitenoise/blob/master/whitenoise/base.py l68 when getting path_info from the environment. was trying to figure out if the issue was the server uwsgi or whitehoise. from reading the wsgi pep it seems the key is optional when the value is a blank string, so maybe whitenoise should handle this?
