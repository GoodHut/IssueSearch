 URL : "https://github.com/SimplaElements/simpla-img/issues/58" TITLE : editor should float on top BODY : the editor is getting z-index of auto , but it should really be floating on top to make sure it's always visible / usable. @seaneking i think all that's happening here is missing a line in the :host styles https://github.com/simplaelements/simpla-img/blob/master/src/simpla-img-editor.html l27 , should have a line z-index: var --simpla-on-top ; ?
