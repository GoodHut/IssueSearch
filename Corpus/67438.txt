 URL : "https://github.com/phrack/ShootOFF/issues/705" TITLE : poi adjustment question BODY : firing 5 shots at the center crosshair doesn't result in consistent beeps registering and inconsistent loud final beep at the fifth shot. in other words, sometimes i get the high pitched beep, sometimes i get the regular shot on target sound and sometimes nothing. i've had the loud confirmation beep on the second shot and often not at all. also, when finished with the poi adjustment, how do i remove the target from the display in order to see my shooting target/background? thanks for any help.
