 URL : "https://github.com/nuxt/docs/issues/208" TITLE : srcdir and rootdir alias BODY : after upgrading to rc7 i noticed a difference in the alias. the example in the docs no longer works javascript ~assets/your_image.png i had to change it to javascript ~/assets/your_image.png i am using the defaults. i can create a pr for the change in the docs but i was curious if anyone else had this issue or if i somehow did not update properly.
