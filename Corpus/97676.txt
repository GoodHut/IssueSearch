BODY : @einars @bitwiseman not trying to ask for work to be done here, but are there a few sentences somewhere that explain the basic approach the project uses to solve the beautification problem? is the idea to start with basic html document schema despite it's inadequacy and use heuristics from there? or maybe to start with help from components from one of the major browser engines? or some other creative idea? is there a concept of rules data, that is external and can be modified without changing code? not trying to be lazy, it would just be helpful to know the philosophy before wading around deeply in code to know the intended overarching philosophies. best regards -
