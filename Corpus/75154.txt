 URL : "https://github.com/rstudio/DT/issues/460" TITLE : get ordering information BODY : hello everyone, maybe i'm missing it but is there a way to get the current ordering from a data table in shiny? the only way i found is to get the ordering via statesave == true but for my app it doesn't make any sense to save the state. something like input$tableid_order would be really nice. thanks for the help in advance.
