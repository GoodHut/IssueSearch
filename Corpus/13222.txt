 URL : "https://github.com/WebMemex/webmemex-extension/issues/42" TITLE : testing the tool BODY : so that @rusuo can get started with exploring the tool with the eyes of testing it, we may compile a list of functions we deem to be most important to cover. just as a disclaimer: i am unexperienced in defining test cases, what i aim to do here is just listing the basic high level processes that should not fail and i aimed to spark a discussion with all those. we may also open up a project for all the test tasks. the ones with 'x' in the end are not yet developed this list is unprioritised: - storing a visited page as a new entry - title - text - screenshot, if available - searching and displaying results - new entry added to index - importing all history items from history api and storing them as new entries without text content - importing all bookmark items from history api and storing them as new entries without text content 'x' - batch fetch all urls without downloaded text content'x' - downloading html of those urls 'x' - cleaning html to get text - storing html to existing page object - storing extracted text to existing page object 'x' - on new visit to existing page, add visit object to it.
