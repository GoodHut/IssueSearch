 URL : "https://github.com/brentsimmons/JSONFeed/issues/46" TITLE : clarify websub support BODY : as discussed on twitter see thread https://twitter.com/julien51/status/865232127184338945 the current hubs property in json feed is not supported by the discovery mechanisms provided by websub https://github.com/w3c/websub formerly known as pubsubhubbub . this partly ties into 44 as websub currently only supports https://w3c.github.io/websub/ discovery discovery through the link relations standardized in the rfc 5988 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988 that is mentioned in 44. and currently also through hostmeta , but that support is at risk https://github.com/w3c/websub/issues/97 of the standard ways outlined in rfc 5988, only the http link: header one can be applied to json feed. there is no standardized way to include link relations within json as there is within xml and html. so unless websub is extended to specifically support a json feed specific discovery mechanism, then the only supported discovery mechanism is the http link: header. ping @manton @julien51
