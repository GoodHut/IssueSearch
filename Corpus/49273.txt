 URL : "https://github.com/rward3182/Solomons/issues/1" TITLE : test form with tariff BODY : hi roger, just wondering if you’d had a chance to test that cascading selects option on collect and check that data from it worked ok with analyse? looks like there’s a fairly urgent need to get a solution for drop-down menus here so i’m thinking of taking the solution we looked at and testing it out here. if it looks like it’s working will share with you and then if we’re all ok we can try rolling it out across solomons. i can’t see any reason why it shouldn’t work but by all accounts tariff is a bit precious about changes – although as i understand it tariff won’t even look at these particular variables as they’re not used in the algorithm.
