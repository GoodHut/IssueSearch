 URL : "https://github.com/mdtraj/mdtraj/issues/1279" TITLE : hdf5 conventions tokens BODY : from what i can tell in the specification you suggest putting a token in the global conventions variable as well as the conventionversion should it be conventionversion like the other variables? that indicates a certain convention used in the hdf5 file. for instance you use the token pande for the original specification. i am planning on making an extension as described and would add my own token. my question is how are users supposed to know what a particular token refers to. should there be a url to the convention page like an xml schema? or a repo of known/trusted conventions? has anyone else even made an extension publicly associated with mdtraj?
