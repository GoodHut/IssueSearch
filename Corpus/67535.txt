 URL : "https://github.com/amaster507/ifbmt/issues/32" TITLE : printing address labels BODY : christopher yetzer shared with me screenshots from an access database that he was given by ed johnson missionary to brazil. it is actually the most sophisticated database i have seen so far which has helped me draw some additional idea. it appears as though it could allow you to print address labels for those who are selected as on the prayer letter mailing list. so question is, how are missionaries processing and printing address labels for newsletters? is this done by the missionary or by the mission board if available? what format s are utilized?
