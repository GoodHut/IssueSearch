 URL : "https://github.com/ngld/knossos/issues/56" TITLE : duplicate mod issues BODY : so, say i create a mod called test locally and there's also a mod test on nebula. i mean.. who would be so lazy as to name a mod test anyway?! but say they also happen to have the same lazy mod id. what a coincidence! knossos will check the local mod against the nebula version, even if they are obviously not the same mod. my test mod was 1.0.0. the nebula version is 2.1.1. amazing! my brand new mod already has an update available! additionally, now i can't delete my local mod, because i don't have permission to delete the nebula version of test . i realize this may be a niche case, but something we should think about. i'm thinking a system should be implemented where knossos either askes nebula if there's duplicates before creating a mod locally or chooses the modid automatically, forcing it to just be randomly numerical or hex or something.
