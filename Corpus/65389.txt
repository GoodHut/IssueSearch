 URL : "https://github.com/UmSenhorQualquer/pyforms/issues/57" TITLE : install from pip broken BODY : hi, first of all thanks for your work! i would like to use pyforms in my small apps, but i encounter some problems: if i pip install pyforms it installs pyforms-0.1.7.3, but if i try to run your first example it complains about pysettings missing. after manually installing pysettings-0.1.90 from pip, it gives me this error: from pysettings import conf importerror: cannot import name 'conf' looks like the pip version of pysettings is outdated, and pyforms setup.py doesn't check the requirements.
