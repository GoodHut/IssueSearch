 URL : "https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five/issues/1362" TITLE : motozero - pwm errors BODY : i'm struggeling getting the motozero to work with johnny-five. it complains about ports not being able to do pwm, but using gpio instead of pwm is the feature of the motozero. i wonder if it's even possible to use all 4 motors with johnny-five. i did some searching but i guess i missed that one page that explains it all. all i could find was python and or arduino related which both is kind of useless tbo. i used this diagram https://pinout.xyz/pinout/motozero and used the wiring-pi numbers for motor1. js motor = new five.motor { pins: 5,2 , pin: 21 } text error: pin 21 does not support mode 3
