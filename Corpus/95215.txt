 URL : "https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/1290" TITLE : create aggregate operation BODY : this new aggregation operation should take an iterable of elements and apply the aggregation in the view/schema. this will be useful for stores that don't support aggregation natively and will allow users to transform elements and then apply aggregation in a chain, e.g: getelements - view -transform - trim whitespace from vertices aggregate the handler for the operation just needs to call aggregateutil.queryaggregate elements, view, schema ;
