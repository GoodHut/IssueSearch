 URL : "https://github.com/hasanen/wpcli/issues/4" TITLE : no error signaling BODY : the client's run method doesn't signal an error in any way. for example irb main :009:0> wp.run plugins list error: 'wp-config.php' not found. either create one manually or use wp config create . => without capturing the error output in some way, i can't programmatically distinguish an error from there just being no plugins installed. it would be great if an exception were raised instead.
