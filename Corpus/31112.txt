 URL : "https://github.com/jooby-project/jooby/issues/879" TITLE : routes in templates BODY : hi! in webdev i come from an asp mvc background so i'm very used to having something like this in my html templates: js // razor template syntax $.get '@url.action ~\invoice\read ', function e { / etc / }; // which gets rendered as: $.get 'https://mydomain.com/appname/invoice/read', function e { / etc / }; // or in an api routes object api.routes = { invoice: { read: '@url.action ~\invoice\read ', update: '@url.action ~\invoice\update ', delete: '@url.action ~\invoice\delete ' }, sales: { dailyreport: '@url.action ~\sales\dailyreport ', rankedreport: '@url.action ~\sales\rankedreport ' } } // rendered as api.routes = { invoice: { read: 'https://mydomain.com/appname/invoice/read', update: 'https://mydomain.com/appname/invoice/update', delete: 'https://mydomain.com/appname/invoice/delete' }, sales: { dailyreport: 'https://mydomain.com/appname/sales/dailyreport', rankedreport: 'https://mydomain.com/appname/sales/rankedreport'' } } } this is really handy since we use sub-routes to locate our apps we have lots of apps under the same domain . i dont even have to set the domain nor the sub route in the application config. is there some utility function similar in jooby that i can use from my templates?
