 URL : "https://github.com/ucisysarch/opencvjs/issues/27" TITLE : build opencv as library BODY : this is an amazing project, but i think it misses one very important opportunity: allow people would to build they're opencv based project for the browser. how can i build opencv as a library no bindings, that i can then link to from my own libs? the bindings/js-expoting will be done from my own code. i din't what to program my algorithms in js, but instead export my c++ code with opencv linked internally. how can i do that?
