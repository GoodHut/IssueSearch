 URL : "https://github.com/kutis96/sc30emu/issues/1" TITLE : rewrite this mess BODY : the user interface is kinda cute for what it was, but this thing is definitely beyond broken. it may be nice to rewrite in such a way that: - it would be possible to set the memory size dynamically. i had no idea about a malloc back then. - the cpu simulation logic is completely separated from the visualization. this may make it tricky to show the read/write flags on registers, but i suppose callbacks could solve that issue. - it is possible to build this for multiple different cpu architectures. - this means adding support for different register/memory widths - add a better io support, a cpu emulator without any peripherals is kinda shitty.
