 URL : "https://github.com/cfe-lab/Kive/issues/652" TITLE : remove custom constraints BODY : discovered that having them run using slurm is problematic because the time they'll be running is usually during runcable execution or during a runstep's bookkeeping stage, which are themselves slurm tasks. rather than fix this further, @donkirkby suggested that we just get rid of the custom constraints altogether. it's not built into the ui anyway, and hasn't been demonstrated to be that desired of a feature.
