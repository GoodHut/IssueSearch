 URL : "https://github.com/cgrandin/csas-latex/issues/80" TITLE : question about figure 83 BODY : anyone having 'git-issues withdrawal' yet? i have a question from paul starr. i note that figure 83 haida gwaii am1 analysis shows a very similar distribution as the previous five figures, but it is no longer centred around 0 and there is a prior plotted. why are there no mpd estimates plotted for these two parameters? i'd like some help in the interpretation. am1 has q1 and q2 parameterized with informative priors: normal prior with log mean prior 0.566 and sd prior 0.274. fig 83 is am1, constant m, hg i notice that we don't have a version of fig 83 for am1, estimate time varying m i.e. the base - see request in next issue. 1 i expect to see prior plotted for ln q2 but unsure why we don't see a similar fig for ln q1 2 yes, adding mpds to these figs and to ln m would be helpful.
