 URL : "https://github.com/starlingbank/starling-api-web-starter-kit/issues/10" TITLE : cors preflights failing BODY : hello : not sure if this is the best place to report this but when talking to the starling api directly from the browser a cors preflight is triggered and this fails because the resulting options http request doesn't come back with the correct cors headers for allowed origin and authentication header. i found this while developing https://far-blue.github.io/starling-export/index.html which works fine in safari if you disable cors restrictions but fails in all browsers in normal circumstances.
