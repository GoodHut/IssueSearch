 URL : "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/753" TITLE : snapshot management api BODY : we need a group of api to manage snapshots on the node: 1 after unpack the image, the chainid and associated metadata should be put into metadata store. 2 inspect: inspect the snapshot with chainid, which should return the corresponding image repodigest must have , tags nice to have , and probably other information in the future. 3 list: list all snapshots on the node. 4 remove: remove snapshot by id. snapshot should be removed immediately if no running container is using it. we also need to be able to check whether a given image reference has a corresponding snapshot existing on the node. which could be done by: 1 image reference exists in metadata store, get chainid and check whether snapshot exists; 2 image reference doesn't exist, resolve it, get chainid and check whether snapshot exists; 3 if snapshot doesn't exist, unpack the image.
