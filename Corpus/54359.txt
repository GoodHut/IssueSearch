 URL : "https://github.com/as/frame/issues/33" TITLE : frame: support kerning BODY : kerning is a correlation of letter spacing between certain characters to make type more legible. it is currently not supported or implemented due to the structure of frame/box.run and frame/box.box. supporting a kerning pair would require a one-box lookbehind during the insertion and deletion into a frame.frame.
