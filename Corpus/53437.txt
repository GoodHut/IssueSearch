 URL : "https://github.com/sschmid/Entitas-CSharp/issues/504" TITLE : dontgenerate attribute BODY : hi, i realized dontgenerate attribute can be handy when we want to delete component and indeed generator remove all references. however component with the attribute is still put into lookup class in given context or first one if set any in attributte . is this common behaviour? cheers
