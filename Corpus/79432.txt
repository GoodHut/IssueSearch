 URL : "https://github.com/google/shaka-player/issues/937" TITLE : shaka and offline events BODY : have you read the faq https://goo.gl/je1sy5 and checked for duplicate issues : yes what version of shaka player are you using : 2.1.5 can you reproduce the issue with our latest release version : yes can you reproduce the issue with the latest code from master : yes are you using the demo app or your own custom app : both if custom app, can you reproduce the issue using our demo app : yes what browser and os are you using : windows, android, macos what are the manifest and license server uris : you can send the uris to <shaka-player-issues@google.com> instead, but please use github and the template for the rest any what did you do? see below. what did you expect to happen? see below. what actually happened? we added some basic offline behaviour into our players - at least to that point, that it shouldnt just crash, when going offline, but instead showing a message, pause contents and wait until network comes back. this works actually quite nice - but sadly, shaka does not like this : when network turns off, we try with pause to pause the player - mostly, an error from shaka is already triggered, but we were able to ignore this. nevertheless, problematic is the return of the internet. afer being sure, internet is back, we seek -5 seconds and start playback again that works also , but once the parts are reached, that were previously not being available because of being offline i think , shaka stops and nothing happens. so, summing it up - is there any way to purge the internal cache or force shaka to reload segments or make shaka not cache/download/try anything when !navigator.online ? thanks a lot! christoph
