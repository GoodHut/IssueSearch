 URL : "https://github.com/line/armeria/issues/821" TITLE : canceltimeout is slow BODY : we cancel a timeout future at the end of every successful response. unfortunately scheduledfuture.cancel is implemented with priorityqueue.remove - remove has o n performance and is expected to be slow with many concurrent requests. @trustin do you think we are abusing cancel and shouldn't be calling it every request? or if it seems like reasonable behavior, should we file an issue in netty to replace the queue with one with fast removals?
