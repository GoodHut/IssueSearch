 URL : "https://github.com/couchbase/docker/issues/77" TITLE : use of ubuntu:12.04 BODY : ubuntu 12.04 reached end of life on april 28, 2017 http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/ , and as such the ubuntu:12.04 image is no longer supported. it's currently in use by the couchbase:enterprise-3.1.6 and couchbase:community-3.1.3 official image tags. these should either also be deprecated if couchbase 3.1 is also no longer supported or updated to use a newer base. thanks!
