 URL : "https://github.com/TaoK/poor-mans-t-sql-formatter-atom-package/issues/4" TITLE : plugin doesn't work BODY : hi, i'd like to flag an issue with this plugin. i just installed it on atom 1.23.1x64 and tried to use it both via the keyboard shortcut ctrl-k shift-f and the menu bar button but nothing happened to my sql file. i've been a long time user of the poor man's tsql formatter on notepad++ and made the switch to atom a couple months ago. i'd really love to use this plugin on atom so let me know if you need more diagnostic info to help identify the problem. zsolt
