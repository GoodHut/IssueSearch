 URL : "https://github.com/miRTop/incubator/issues/13" TITLE : gff3::source | gff3::type BODY : hi all again! cc: @lpantano @gurgese @thomasdesvignes @mhalushka @mlhack @keilbeck @bastianfromm @ivlachos @tju-cmc i propose to use the database used by the tool to put in the second column: source i propose to use these labels for the type column 3rd : hairpin : this could be the parent annotated: this could be the annotated in the database, this _is child from hairpin_. i am trying to avoid canonical as we have discussed before. maybe reference is another idea since it would be similar to the problem we have for snps, where reference it was just designated by the first genomes sequenced but doesn't mean is the most abundant. mirna is another we can use i guess. isomir/variant: this could be the detected sequence, this is _child from previous one_ other types of mirnas? contribute with more options or any thoughts you have about it! thanks!
