 URL : "https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/issues/1685" TITLE : is this syntax possible? BODY : following code is taken from docs const myapp = stacknavigator { home: { screen: homescreen }, profile: { screen: profilescreen }, }, { initialroutename: 'home', } i went to docs and i see there are large number of options are possible to configure and use navigation. this is good and needed for success of any project. ability to configure in desire way. i am not asking to change any syntax or modify current implementation. i am just asking that would it possible to support following syntax too. this will help to improve readability. const myapp = stacknavigator { home: homescreen, profile: profilescreen, }, { initialroutename: 'home', } imo- react-navigation can support both syntax.
