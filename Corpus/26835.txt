 URL : "https://github.com/rappasoft/laravel-5-boilerplate/issues/937" TITLE : cannot modify users BODY : installed the boilerplate on fresh laravel 5.4. my system is windows 7, php 7.1. i can create users but none appear under the management. can this be because of the php/os? if yes, what can be changed to make it work. further, immediately after the installation under composer, i get error that there are no commands defined in the package namespace. could it be that the installation did not go well, or this would be under the os?
