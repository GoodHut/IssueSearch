 URL : "https://github.com/ccampbell/xtab/issues/4" TITLE : xtab on terminal server BODY : hi, first of all, thanks for your great extension. i would like to use it on a windows terminal server for the users in my organization using group policy as a forced-installed app. however, after the extension is installed i would like also to force some specific settings e.g. max number of tabs to 5 and prevent the users from changing it. is the above possible with xtab? i appreciate your help!. regards,
