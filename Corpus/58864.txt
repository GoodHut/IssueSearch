 URL : "https://github.com/practicalmeteor/meteor-chai/issues/11" TITLE : support for chai-http? BODY : this package has been extremely help so far but i found myself in need of the functionality provided by chai-http. from what i can see the only way i can get that functionality is by downloading the chai npm package as well as the one for chai-http. is there a way to use chai-http through this package that i might have missed? the main issue is that i don't have access to chai.use , which means i can't get at chai-http.
