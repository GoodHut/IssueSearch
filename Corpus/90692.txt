 URL : "https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant-polymer/issues/229" TITLE : split icons in two groups BODY : our icon situation has gotten out of hand. we are depending on the community maintained material design icons and they keep growing. and each icon that is added, is another icon that we ship over, parse and keep in memory and might never use. it is currently the biggest asset that we ship at 185kb minified. to make it worse, because the renderer iron-icon is unable to be notified to re-render, we are currently loading the icons before showing the ui. i think that it's time to split icons into two files: create one file with 'internal' icons. those are the ones that are used in the ui or by cards or domains. we will prefix that collection with hass: . these icons will be included with the main app bundle. we will also create a new web component named hass-icon . if the given icon starts with mdi: it will make sure to load the icons from the server before rendering the iron-icon . this should improve load performance a lot.
