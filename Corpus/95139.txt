 URL : "https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-tab-view/issues/289" TITLE : coverflow example question BODY : hey, is it possible to get the coverflow example to work with tabviewpagerscroll instead of tabviewpagerpan? the issue with the latter i had is that it was inside a scrollview and swiping sometimes triggered vertical scrolling. tabviewpagerscroll doesn't have that issue due to directionallockenabled i guess , but it only shows one item at a time, and i'd like to have the same effect as the coverflow example showing part of the previous/next item .
