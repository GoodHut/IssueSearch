 URL : "https://github.com/SamGunGraven/MinecraftExpertMode/issues/6" TITLE : add ore generation BODY : ideally ore generation would be like the following consisting of 3 layers: - under <32 be like vanilla maybe slightly less, something like ~25% - higher biomes any mountain/peak/etc... should have some resources uniformly distributed perhaps 50% of regular vanilla, but evenly distributed through the whole y - motherlode generation just like gold in the mesa, have preferred biomes for each element where they spawn much more frequently, even in surface patches , this means gold in mesa, lapis in magical, redstone in deserts/beaches, silver in mountains and iron in plains and lowlands
