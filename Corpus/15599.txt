 URL : "https://github.com/Modified-MW-DF/modified-MDF/issues/13" TITLE : evil trader crash BODY : literally, when evil traders leave the map, they can and will crash the game. every item in the caravan gets listed as stolen and when the hundreds/thousands of announcements pop up simultaneously the game just gives up. i _suspect_ it's based on the item_thief and babysnatcher tokens. primarily item_thief. i'm surprised kobolds don't set it off, but apparently any civ that is put on team evil will do it. the solution is probably to not allow people to run fortress with the item_thief token enabled on a civ, since this is ultimately a vanilla df issue.
