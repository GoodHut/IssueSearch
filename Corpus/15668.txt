 URL : "https://github.com/Deletescape-Media/Lawnchair/issues/664" TITLE : feature request : BODY : not sure if this is the right place to ask - i've never used github before. a feature toggle to blur the current wallpaper would be nice if possible. would look nice when using light wallpapers with light icons - makes them more visible. thank you for the awesome product, team lawnchair!
