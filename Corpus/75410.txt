 URL : "https://github.com/hgueziri/FastDRaW-Segmentation/issues/4" TITLE : help for easier citation BODY : hi, it would be nice if you could provide a bibtex file next to your source code. e.g. if you try to import bibtex from google scholar, then google parsed the proceedings horribly. check it in google scholar. however, it is not clear e.g. who is the publisher, is it a proceedings or a special issue, if there is any page number, etc. the best practice would be: - provide a bibtex file in the github repository - give a doi and/or link the original article, etc. if the article is open access and copyable, it might be a good idea to directly publish a pdf in the github repository. but this depends on the publisher, check it first if it is allowed. - add duecredit support to your code https://github.com/duecredit/duecredit +1: i assume that scikit-image would be interested in a pull request. it might be some work to actually merge it into the code base, but it would make it much more known, and probably would generate more citations/collaborations/etc. or into opencv, etc. but skimage is the most similar, in my opinion, to your code in style, language, etc.
