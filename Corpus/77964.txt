 URL : "https://github.com/jlmakes/scrollreveal/issues/386" TITLE : override style attribute BODY : scrollreveal overrides the style attribute if there are always properties applied to it. this can cause other jquery libraries to conflict. as a workaround, i use an extra wrapper div to apply scrollreveal to, but it might be better if scrollreveal was aware of existing style attributes.
