 URL : "https://github.com/nanobox-io/nanobox-pkgsrc-base/issues/38" TITLE : python 3.6 package issues BODY : i am unable to get a working python 3 install on nanobox. i cannot get all the core packages to install. it seems the core libs py36-celementtree , py36-curses , py36-expat , py36-readline , py36-sqlite3 are not all compiled for the various python 3 versions. some are there for some every python 3.6 build .0, .1, .2, .3 , but not a complete set for a specific version. the engine tells it to install py36-sqlite3 , but it does not. it completes the build and then errors when i try to use sqlite. if i try to make it install by adding py36-sqlite3 to extra_packages the build fails. can all the core python libraries but compiled for each python 3 version?
