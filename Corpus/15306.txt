 URL : "https://github.com/opengeospatial/geopackage/issues/282" TITLE : ddl is incomplete BODY : i found that geopackages in the wild were failing /opt/features/vector_features/data/feature_table_integer_primary_key because the primary key did not have a not null of 1. upon further review it is because they are using our ddl from http://www.geopackage.org/spec/ _sample_feature_table_informative the ddl needs to be updated to have a not null in it.
