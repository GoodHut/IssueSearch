 URL : "https://github.com/databricks/tensorframes/issues/134" TITLE : support for multiple gpus BODY : tensorframes should be able to run tasks concurrently on separate gpus, if they are available. this should be possible with the latest tensorflow java api: https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/java/reference/org/tensorflow/session.html session org.tensorflow.graph, byte assuming that all the gpus are available for running tasks, they can be locked onto specific sessions in python by using the following code: python config = tf.configproto config.gpu_options.visible_device_list = 0 or different values session = tf.session config=config
