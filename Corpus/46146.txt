 URL : "https://github.com/chrismsimpson/Metropolis/issues/13" TITLE : line height weirdness BODY : appears to be some extra spacing below the characters. especially apparent when using as a web font for things like navigation, buttons etc which have line-height specified. possibly just the way the web fonts were converted? obviously can be rectified manually with css, but would be nice to be able to have it a bit more universal so to speak?
