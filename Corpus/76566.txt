 URL : "https://github.com/meejah/txtorcon/issues/218" TITLE : lighter weight torconfig BODY : currently torconfig s implementation queries all config values and keeps them available synchronously rather than having e.g. a deferred-returning get_conf ... call for every one. for applications that run through a control port filtering proxy such as whonix or subgraph run this can be a problem because they have to whitelist all getconf commands even if the application in question never actually accesses them . also, some users find the way you access configuration items from torconfig to be too magic . so, it would be nice to have an alternative implementation available. this alternative should also be used by .connect and .launch so that applications don't produce a surprising number of getconf queries. the downside of this is that there cannot be any pre-parsing or sanity checking of values that you set using this. however, users doing configuration editing can always choose to use the more convenient torconfig object instead if they want. see also 215 as this implies the api for the new tor object's give me a config object is wrong.
