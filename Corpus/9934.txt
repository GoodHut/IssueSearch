 URL : "https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/metasmoke/issues/201" TITLE : add routes to ui BODY : there are a few recent url routes that are useful that haven't been added to the ui. that makes it hard to find a few weeks after implementation as the chat messages are lost to the whim of search and user memory. the one that i can think of is announcements. there was something added a few weeks ago too.
