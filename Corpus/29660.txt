BODY : quickquestion with meteor i would like to insert an autoform and this package gave me quick results, so that is excellent <autoform schema={books._collection.simpleschema } onsubmit={doc => console.log doc } /> however onsubmit did only the expected console.log and no document was inserted in the db. should i still write the insert function myself including the clear form function?
