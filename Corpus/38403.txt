 URL : "https://github.com/uber/deck.gl/issues/418" TITLE : picking issues in v4 BODY : @shaojingli @pessimistress setting blend mode in layer.draw breaks picking - reason is that picking calls layer.draw after disabling picking and layer turns it on again. - picking needs to be able to override blend mode - excellent use case for new gl state management in luma.gl, should we land? all visible layers must participate in picking to ensure occlusion - glsl picking module should have an option to just render no picking color black or white so that we can render non-pickable layers into the render buffer overwriting picking colors of pickable layers below it . - how do we deal with tranparency? automatically exclude transparent non-pickable layers from occluding? add a prop? add auto highlight function to glsl picking package while we are doing these changes?
