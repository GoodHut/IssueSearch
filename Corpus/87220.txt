 URL : "https://github.com/olifolkerd/tabulator/issues/444" TITLE : iterate through each cell BODY : hi, i'm trying to create a validation function that iterates through each cell and runs a different validation method depending on what column it is in. is there a native way to iterate through each cell? i'm aiming to get an array of all columns, and from that, to get all cell components in that column and iterate through that way. i previously created a validation method this way by javascript's getelementsbyclassname, but since i can't call the tabulator call backs upon this can't call .getcolumn , this is futile. thanks for the help.
