 URL : "https://github.com/amberframework/amber/issues/298" TITLE : including css / assets BODY : this seems to be a bit undocumented. can we get some info about the asset pipeline and just like some really basic basics? for example, in the default project there is assets/stylesheets/main.scss but from what i can tell this file does not get complied to css or included in the default homepage in the head section of the resulting html, i only see a stylesheet tag for bootstrap . what am i missing? how do i include app-generated css/sass assets in a layout? thanks!
