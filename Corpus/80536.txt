 URL : "https://github.com/PCMDI/cmor/issues/162" TITLE : ugrid grid specification BODY : i'm planning to add a request for a variable ugrid which will contain ugrid information about any unstructured grids we expect data from at least one model with an unstructured ocean grid . my understanding is that cmor can handle data variables on unstructured grids following the cf convention, but does not provide the full specification of the grid as defined in the ugrid convention. so a separate variable is requested with this information, but perhaps it will not be supported by cmor? at this point, it is a very small use-case, and it may be better to let the one modeling group that needs this provide their own file.
