 URL : "https://github.com/rmotr-curriculum/itp-class-questions/issues/4" TITLE : why does the code work? BODY : so in this code, i basically got to this point and was testing to see if the output would work, and it does, but i'm unsure as to why the for loop doesn't return 'not an int' as well as the sum of the rest of the numbers? for instance shouldn't print sum_if_list_of_ints 1,4,'b',7 output:
'not an int'
12 since the the 'return sum' on line 8 is outside the for loop block?
