 URL : "https://github.com/geneontology/go-ontology/issues/14597" TITLE : review design patterns BODY : hello, at the ontology editors call we should review design patterns to make sure they are ok and that we all understand them. for eg i am looking at https://github.com/geneontology/go-ontology/blob/master/src/design_patterns/cc_transport.yaml and while the name suggests to me it relates to a cellular component, it in fact describes the process of transport. thanks, pascale
