 URL : "https://github.com/ProteinsWebTeam/ebi-metagenomics-cwl/issues/5" TITLE : 1st draft overview BODY : cwl descriptions for each tool - seqprep - https://github.com/proteinswebteam/ebi-metagenomics-cwl/pull/4 - trimmomatic - work in progress at https://github.com/common-workflow-language/workflows/pull/132 order of trimming steps can still be made more flexible https://github.com/common-workflow-language/common-workflow-language/issues/427 issuecomment-293593340 - biopython > sequences < 100 nucleotides in length removed. - need to find the script - fraggenescan - how is this used at ebi? - updated at https://github.com/proteinswebteam/ebi-metagenomics-cwl/pull/3 - interproscan is its own workflow with job engine, many third party tools. could be broken down further into cwl for better efficiency - qiime > 16s rrna are annotated using the greengenes reference database default closed-reference otu picking protocol with greengenes 13.8 reference with reverse strand matching enabled . - which parts of qiime are used and how? containers for each tool - seqprep - trimmomatic - evaluate https://github.com/common-workflow-language/workflows/blob/master/tools/trimmomatic-dockerfile - biopython - fraggenescan - interproscan would be about 5 gib unless reference data is made separate - qiime evaluate https://github.com/h3abionet/h3abionet16s/blob/master/dockerfiles/qiime/dockerfile and compare with debian based approach
