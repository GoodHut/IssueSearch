 URL : "https://github.com/eonpatapon/gnome-shell-extension-transmission-daemon/issues/54" TITLE : gnome shell 3.24 BODY : unfortunalaty this extension does not work anymore in gnome 3.24. it worked in 3.22 after adding 3.22 in metadata.json, but that trick won't work for 3.24. maybe another issue, but i can't find any errors in looking glass. but the main question is if this extension is still developed?
