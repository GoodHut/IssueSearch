 URL : "https://github.com/Kevin-Jin/mmap/issues/1" TITLE : support logical values BODY : it appears that some code for lglsxp has already been made in mmap.c in the mmap_extract and mmap_replace functions. it appears to be missing in the data.frame case, however. in both functions. to start, only implement as.mmap.logical for the c_logi8 mode rather than c_bits mode because figuring out how to encode na in the c_bits mode requires a bit more creativity.
