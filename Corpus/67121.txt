 URL : "https://github.com/potree/potree.github.io/issues/7" TITLE : osgeo community project BODY : it's relatively easy to apply as osgeo community project. https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/osgeo_community_projects at the moment there is a lot of activity in osgeo with developing a new logo and website and a lot of content is reviewed as well. there are no difficult hurdles to become an osgeo community project and it helps a bit to be compliant with at least the basics of and open source project. fyi, the logos on the wiki page are the old ones and will be replaced soon.
