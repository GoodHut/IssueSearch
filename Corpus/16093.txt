 URL : "https://github.com/KamiKillertO/vscode-colorize/issues/50" TITLE : hex alpha support BODY : hi, i love this extension but was hoping support for hexadecimal colors with alpha could be supported. while it's not a widely used color notation, vs code does allow them for workbench color customizations in settings and it would be useful for theming. i was going to fork and make a pull request, but it seemed like overkill since it is a one line change. all that needs to be done is change line 4 in ./src/lib/extractors/hexa-extractor.ts from export const regexp = / \da-f {3}| \da-f {6} ?:$| |'|,| |;|\ |\r| /gi; to export const regexp = / \da-f {3}| \da-f {6}| \da-f {8} ?:$| |'|,| |;|\ |\r| /gi; . this will make the regex accept the extra 2 characters, but no other change is needed since the conversion to rgb only accepts the first 6 characters and will discard the extra 2. the rgba extractor seems to discard the alpha channel so this behavior seems appropriate. let me know if this could be added, thanks!
