 URL : "https://github.com/boost-starai/BoostSRL/issues/7" TITLE : clearing out large files BODY : clearing out large files a few sections of the repository history need to be rewritten in order to clear out datasets that were written at various points in time. this includes datasets which are now on boost-starai/boostsrl-misc and others which are still be removed from the master branch of this repo. this can be done fairly easily with the bfg-repo-cleaner https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/ . overview of steps after downloading the jar : clone a mirror of the repository i.e. just the .git contents : git clone --mirror https://github.com/boost-starai/boostsrl.git use the bfg to delete the contents of sampletestbeds: java -jar bfg.jar --delete-folders sampletestbeds --no-blob-protection boostsrl.git/ reflog and cleanup: git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now --aggressive git reflog expire --expire=now : prune entries older than now from references. --prune=now : prune entries older than now from repository. --aggressive : aggressively optimize the repository at the expense of taking much more time.
