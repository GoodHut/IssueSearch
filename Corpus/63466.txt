 URL : "https://github.com/WoWManiaUK/Redemption/issues/922" TITLE : dungeon dire maul, east BODY : seems the same issues from dungeon: dire maul east specifically 84 are back again. pusilin runs across the sky then back to his beginning spot. and hydrospawn swims up the air out of reach, and if you try to reach him on the 2nd level he resets.
