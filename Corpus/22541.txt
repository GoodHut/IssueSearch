 URL : "https://github.com/cgarwood/hatouch/issues/13" TITLE : lock screen option BODY : add the option to require a pin/passcode for different pages. this wouldn't help secure the hass install itself if someone knew the api they could still do whatever they want , but could keep kids or guests from accessing certain screens. there's an example lockscreen.php in the repo already, just need to actually implement it.
