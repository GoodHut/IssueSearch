 URL : "https://github.com/geoadmin/mf-geoadmin3/issues/4066" TITLE : feature search uses bbox BODY : 1. start https://s.geo.admin.ch/77337d0469 2. search for 1469353 3. feature is found 4. search for 9051164 5. feature is not found workaround: zoom out and search again -> feature is found. feature search is using the window bbox in order to search for feature -> is it really wanted ? @davidoesch @gjn ? my proposal is to remove the bbox filter in this case and maybe use it only in order to order the result list
