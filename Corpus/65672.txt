 URL : "https://github.com/MaslowCNC/Firmware/issues/245" TITLE : jump the version number BODY : it makes for less confusion if the firmware and ground control have the same version numbers, and with development ongoing on both of them, there are unlikely to be weeks where one is changed and the other isn't at least for a fair while so i would suggest that you bump the version number of the firmware to match the version of ground control in next week's update
