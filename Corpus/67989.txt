 URL : "https://github.com/mafintosh/dns-socket/issues/6" TITLE : recursive query support BODY : i have a use case where it would be necessary to do full recursive queries beginning from the roots, similar to dig +trace . i thought we could do when a falsy server option is given. i maintain a package with the root hints at https://github.com/silverwind/root-hints, which would have to be included as a dependency. two topics on which i'm unsure about: - should intermediate queries and responses be included in the results? - how to choose ipv4 vs ipv6 root servers? if this is out of scope of this module, i could also just make a wrapping module.
