 URL : "https://github.com/Zomboided/service.vpn.manager/issues/28" TITLE : autostart with addons BODY : hi zomboided, thanks for the great addon! the autostart function with certain addons is nice, but doesn't work when using favorites. for example, starting a youtube video set as a favorite doesn't let the vpn connect. the same issue happens when working with yatse. navigating through kodi with yatse and starting a video in an addon that is set as an autostart addon for the vpn doesn't let the vpn connect. have you plans for future versions to handle this?
