 URL : "https://github.com/nilmtk/nilmtk/issues/606" TITLE : remove the usage of argv BODY : i would remove all argv in the function signatures in favour of named parameters. this is also the paradigm in scikit learn and makes things much more readable. eg. loader_kwargs will still be a dictionary in the algorithm's signatures, but at least a named one. at the moment it just collects all paramters implicitly.
