 URL : "https://github.com/libertyernie/LoopingAudioConverter/issues/11" TITLE : feature request nus3bank BODY : i have one last request, sm4sh modding is using for music and sound a nus3bank format. sure i can easily use the tool i need to do this but its too long and the ending loop always do a crackled sound. your tool is so well organized so i really need this format to work with also a fixed end loop. you can check the easy nus3bank editor with gui to see what i mean. nus3bank can be read with vgmstream an add-on for foobar2000 .
