 URL : "https://github.com/sbs20/filenotes-android/issues/4" TITLE : add note sorting BODY : dear developer, i really enjoy your filenote app: it's simple and it get things done, particularly after my old app stopped syncing with dropbox due to api v1 depreciation. is there a way to sort the notes not alphabetically, but by its modified dates? i have scores of notes, and it is rather tedious to scroll through them rather than having recently worked on notes right on the top. thank you for your nice app! best regards
