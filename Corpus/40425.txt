 URL : "https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2/issues/326" TITLE : u8g2 as class member BODY : when i use the library like in the tutorial and call u8x8.begin in the setup function, everything works fine. i want to have a class display which handles all my display stuff. therefore i wanted to define u8g2 as a class member of display and instantiate it when the constructor of the display class is called. in the constructor i then call u8x8.begin . however this does not work. the call to u8x8.begin is not working... how can i define and use the u8x8 class as a member of my display class? kind regards, thomas
