 URL : "https://github.com/CodefoundryDE/LegacyWrapper/issues/6" TITLE : enhance pipe security BODY : the problem the current implementation uses a named pipe to enable communication between wrapper and client. this is insecure, because a named pipe can be read by anyone who knows its name. the possible solution either there is a way to encrypt traffic going over the pipe e.g. tls , or we switch to another secure ipc technology.
