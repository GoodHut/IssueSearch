 URL : "https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/flasky/issues/324" TITLE : logging in flasky BODY : hi, miguel. i notice you change the logger handler's level from warning to info in the second edition, why did you do it? with 2436 https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2436 , flask's built-in logger app.logger will have a warning level. so, the handlers in flasky will not get the log records less than warning level. maybe you need to add this line: python app.logger.setlevel logging.info
