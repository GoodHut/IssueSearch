 URL : "https://github.com/cernekee/ics-openconnect/issues/27" TITLE : per-app vpn support BODY : hello, does your code/library support per-app vpn? would it be technically possible to merge this code with my own student project to try to establish a per-app vpn connection, ideally upon starting of an app e.g. in oncreate , while leaving the other app's communication on the phone intact? thanks in advance. niki
