 URL : "https://github.com/sarahlim/shoutkey-firefox/issues/1" TITLE : shoutkey.com is down BODY : hey, i have been roaming around github tags finding projects tied to shoutkey.com and found your project which is an awesome chrome extension. but the sad part is if may not already know shoutkey.com is down. however, i have a site called openkey that works almost the exact same way shoutkey does, if you want to use it the project is open sourced including the api i created using nodejs. if not it is totally fine, hope you have a great day or night.
