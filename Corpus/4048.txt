 URL : "https://github.com/protofire/solhint/issues/16" TITLE : add gcc format BODY : i tried to integrate solhint with ale https://github.com/w0rp/ale a lint engine for vim that takes advantage of vim 8 async features , but i wasn't able to do it because none of the formatters is supported by ale, at least right now. there is support for the unix format, but it can't tell warnings from errors. adding a gcc formatter to solhint seems to me like the easiest way to do it.
