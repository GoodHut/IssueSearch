 URL : "https://github.com/Bailador/Bailador/issues/124" TITLE : api first development BODY : usually every route ends with a call to template 'some.html', { ... }; it might be more interesting if bailador made it simple to create an api that returns json and on top of that to return html pages. so a normal route of bailador would return a datastructure and the name of a template. then bailador would either return only the datastructure as a json or would call the template function with the given template and the data structure. how can this kind of coding made simple and obvious to use?
