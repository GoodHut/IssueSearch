 URL : "https://github.com/HaliteChallenge/Halite-II/issues/398" TITLE : halite tv page BODY : - top level of the nav - video viewer - same controls as visualizer but no stats, just plays the first game of the feed when page loads - expand icon takes user to that game as a visualizer page in a new tab - video feed: most recent videos. prototype is here: https://halite.io/game-feed - user should be able to filter games using the same filters as the leaderboard - filters by the players in the game. if any player meets the filter criteria, the game is eligible. - if user filters list of videos, the feed at the top of the page should filter too and url should change to reflect query so we can share filters - list of videos at the bottom is same as game video widget on the user profile except demarcates which videos are challenges ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/764613/34445583-b4b39fca-eca2-11e7-9505-9d35dccb80a9.png
