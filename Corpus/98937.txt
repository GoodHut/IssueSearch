 URL : "https://github.com/cyderize/rust-websocket/issues/135" TITLE : localhost does not resolve BODY : i tried to open an async connection to a server running locally at ws://localhost:4000 and received the following error: ioerror error { repr: os { code: 61, message: connection refused } } however, the following work: opening an async websocket connection to ws://127.0.0.1:4000 . so my code connects once dns is resolved. opening an async websocket connection to ws://echo.websocket.org . so websocket dns resolution does work in some cases. opening a synchronous websocket connection to http://localhost:4000 . so local dns resolution works but only for synchronous connections. opening an async http connection to http://localhost:4000 with hyper 0.11. does hyper 0.11 use a different tokio primitive to resolve dns? i'm not exactly sure what's going on. it's not a big deal - i'm manually resolving localhost to 127.0.0.1 - but i'm kind of curious.
