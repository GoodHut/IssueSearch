 URL : "https://github.com/johnrbnsn/Adafruit_Python_MAX31856/issues/2" TITLE : bit shifting isn't correct BODY : the bit shifting does not strip the unused bits from the low byte in the internal or external temp functions. in readtempc , this temp_bytes = val_high_byte & 0x7f << 11 + val_mid_byte << 3 + val_low_byte should be put the bytes together temp_bytes = val_high_byte & 0x7f << 16 + val_mid_byte << 8 + val_low_byte ignore the 5 least significant bits temp_bytes = temp_bytes >> 5 a similar correction is needed in readinternaltempc to ignore the 2 least significant bits btw, thank you for creating this library. it accelerated my use of the max31856 on the pi.
