 URL : "https://github.com/Starcounter/Docs/issues/25" TITLE : rename puppet web apps BODY : the section describing how to build web apps using puppet is now called puppet web apps https://docs.starcounter.io/guides/puppet-web-apps/ . with the renaming of puppet to palindrome, all references to puppet should be updated. my thought is that palindrome web apps wouldn't be that descriptive of a name. my suggestion is to use a more generic name like thin client web apps . if there's no opposition to that new name, i'll go ahead and implement it early next week. @mmnosek @warpech
