 URL : "https://github.com/asascience-open/IOOS-EDS/issues/113" TITLE : misspellings in layer list BODY : the water level layer list contains a couple misspellings: deleware = delaware ney york = new york and in the currents layer list the first layer shown is noaa gulf of mexico, which should be much farther down the list. i think there's an empty space/character in front of noaa causing it to be listed first. live ocean = liveocean currents/salinity/water temp/winds layers -- remove the space.
