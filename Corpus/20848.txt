 URL : "https://github.com/OpenBazaar/openbazaar-go/issues/485" TITLE : data on categories BODY : at duo we'd like to encourage vendors to use the ebay categorisation tree that is shared publicly http://pages.ebay.co.uk/categorychanges/ . there's a full csv here http://pics.ebaystatic.com/aw/pics/uk/categorychanges/uk_new_structure_ oct2016 .csv . unlike ob1.0 which had a single category field, ob2.0 has a list of categories https://github.com/openbazaar/openbazaar-go/blob/master/pb/protos/contracts.proto l62 . this list can be used for subcategories, up 10-levels deep https://github.com/duomoney/encrypter-core/blob/master/core/listings.go l20 . for reference, ebay's category tree goes down to the 6 levels deep. the maximum character length category within the ebay catalogue is other warner bros collectibles , which is 30 characters. this falls within the ob2.0 limit of 40 characters https://github.com/duomoney/encrypter-core/blob/master/core/listings.go l24 . so it looks like openbazaar 2.0 is capable of reusing ebay's category tree out of the box! what do people think of encouraging vendors to reuse the ebay category tree when creating listings? should we encourage vendors to use the first category and their top level one, then walk down into finer and finer subcategories? at the very least, this would help a lot for seo on duo. could we include ebay's category tree as a dropdown suggestion, in addition to the free-text fields? cc @hoffmabc @tyler-smith @jjeffryes @tiavlovskiegor24 @jackkleeman
