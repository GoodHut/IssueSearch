 URL : "https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/issues/1706" TITLE : database label selection BODY : when attempting to select a label from the database navigation view i get an error about not being able to subtract an int from a dict. this can be corrected by changing line 395 of 'digits/dataset/images/classification/views.py' from: total_entries = task.distribution str label to: total_entries = task.distribution str label 'count' i would fix it my self but i have not filled out a contributer license agreement.
