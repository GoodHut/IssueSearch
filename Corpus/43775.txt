 URL : "https://github.com/aicis/fresco/issues/210" TITLE : demos: parties' input BODY : hello, i was looking at the demos and trying to understand them. in all demos, you have a number of parties that execute the mpc protocol, but only one of them provides the input. for example, in the aggregation demo, player 1 provides his inputs 2d matrix , as follows: // player 1 provides input if root.getbasicnumericcontext .getmyid == 1 { closed = root.collections .closematrix readinputs , 1 ; } else { // if we aren't player 1 we need to provide the expected size of the input closed = root.collections .closematrix 8, 2, 1 ; } documentation does not contain any information about the input of the players. can you explain why only one player provides input? thanks in advance, dimitris
