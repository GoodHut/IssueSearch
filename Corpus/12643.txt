 URL : "https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11559" TITLE : react 15.6.2 tag BODY : it looks like the react 15.6.2 tag never got pushed to github. should we just cut a new tag? the biggest annoyance for me is that the release is missing in the dropdown for our dom test fixtures: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/new i can just append to the url. no huge deal, but it seems low effort. i can take care of it if no-one minds.
