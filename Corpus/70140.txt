 URL : "https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi/issues/302" TITLE : upload to sd greyed out BODY : this is a new install using the 0.13.0 image on a raspberry pi 3b. it is attached to an anet a8 prusa i3 clone 3d printer. i attach to the rpi via its built in wifi on my home wifi system. i use firefox for my browser on win10. the interface works great to upload locally and run a print job. when i try to drag and drop a gcode file to upload to sd , it says sd card not initialized . i have formatted the sd card in the anet board using sd formatter and it shows up normal on file explorer. also, it appears that the monitoring and control functions work fine with the exception of the motors off button. i'll submit that as a seperate issue.
