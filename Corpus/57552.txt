 URL : "https://github.com/jed/140bytes/issues/7" TITLE : question wiki examples BODY : i was looking at https://github.com/jed/140bytes/wiki/byte-saving-techniques and the majority of examples on what is byte saving is what something like uglify should be doing. other examples like js setinterval 'console.log z ',100 // after is a definite no since that's an example of implicit eval call js function a,b {b=1;...} // after is also not good since v8 doesn't like that and it de-optimized code https://github.com/vhf/v8-bailout-reasons provides good desc of potential issues. i am just making sure that people who are new to js doesn't take these examples uses them thinking they are doing a good thing.
