 URL : "https://github.com/gi0baro/weppy-website/issues/1" TITLE : syntax highlighting error BODY : heya, minor thing. in the docs page for dal/operations http://weppy.org/docs/1.0/dal/operations , the string and text operators has some strange syntax highlighting. it seems like the % symbol is triggering a switch to red from green. this is probably upstream of you, and is the concern of whoever wrote the highlighting system you're using, but i figured you'd be more capable of looking into it, if you care.
