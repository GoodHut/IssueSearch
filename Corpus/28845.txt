 URL : "https://github.com/davicotico/jQuery-Menu-Editor/issues/2" TITLE : iconclass not found BODY : in my environment, i get undefined for 'fa' class so my icon classes are set as 'undefined fa-icon-name' which results in no icon being showing up. so, as a work around, i changed the jquery-menu-editor.js a bit, iconpicker.on 'change', function e { //var iconclass = e.iconclass!=='' ? iconclass+' ' : ''; var iconclass = ; if typeof e.iconclass === 'undefined' || e.iconclass === '' { console.log 'undefined iconclass' ; iconclass = fa ; } $ mnu_icon .val iconclass+e.icon ; console.log $ mnu_icon .val ; //console.log } ; doing this, issue is resolved but i want to know from where iconclass can be set so that issue does not show up with default setup.
