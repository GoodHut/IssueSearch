 URL : "https://github.com/nteract/vdom/issues/38" TITLE : css module BODY : since the style attribute has to be a dict pure code has to be written like this: python div hello , style={ border : red 3px solid , padding : 10px 20px 10px 20px , display : inline-block , fontweight : 600 , color : red } since i really like using keyword arguments throughout since we use it for all the dom properties , i sometimes use a dict , sometimes aliasing it as style : python div hello , style=dict border= red 3px solid , padding= 10px 20px 10px 20px , display= inline-block , fontweight= 600 , color= red or even style = dict div hello , style=style border= red 3px solid , padding= 10px 20px 10px 20px , display= inline-block , fontweight= 600 , color= red what would you all think if we had from from vdom import style or from vdom import css , where it was just a simple function that turned all keyword arguments into the proper style dict. this would help us close 31, at least for styles.
