 URL : "https://github.com/hackseq/hackseq_2017/issues/18" TITLE : extra social media BODY : hey @abaghela , i was just perusing the reddit /r/bioinformatics https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/ subreddit and thought there were a few other places we could advertise for team-leader recruitment and general hackseq awareness. do we have a reddit account for this? and how about the biostars forum https://www.biostars.org/t/forum/ or perhaps somewhere else on biostars? maybe seqanswers.com http://seqanswers.com/ too? does anyone know any other relevant bioinformatics website we should post too?
