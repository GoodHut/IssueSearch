 URL : "https://github.com/HutchBusinessGroup/ELDv3.0/issues/80" TITLE : speed violations issues BODY : clients are complaining that speed violations are accuring while on the highway when they are not speeding. some drivers are saying that their navigation is saying that they are driving on an exit or a parallel road when they are actually on the highway... the system then says that they are doing 65mph in a 30 mph zone but they are actually on the highway still. we need to adjust provisioning of tablets or navigation to improve how exact/focused the gps is.
