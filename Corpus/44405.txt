 URL : "https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi-Node/issues/77" TITLE : example for pwmwrite? BODY : hi, apologies for a newcomer question, but i was unable to find example code how to pwmwrite to a led. my setup looks correct, and running sunfounder python code 04_pwmled.py from the superkit 2 code snippets lets the led pulse as expected. with wiringpi-node, i'm running the following snippet on my pi 3: 'use strict'; var wpi = require 'wiringpi-node' ; wpi.setup 'wpi' ; wpi.pinmode 1, wpi.pwm_output ; wpi.pwmwrite 1, 0 ; ...which lights up the led but as soon as i run it, my rasperry ext4 filesystem crashes and the only option is to pull the plug. google results suggest that these ext4 fs errors occur due to power supply issues - as they do not occur with the python code, and it's an power supply coming with a standard rasperry pi kit, i'd assume it's not hardware related. any ideas what's wrong? any initialisation i skipped? any code samples i could try? is there a repository of more wiringpi-node examples? any pointers are appreciated. thanks!
