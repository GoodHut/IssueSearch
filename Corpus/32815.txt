 URL : "https://github.com/taglib/taglib/issues/817" TITLE : write m4a atom rate BODY : so it seems there is something funny going on when trying to write the rate atom. it is not directly in mp4::tag::save function. so long as you just read what another program has written, it works fine. but as soon as you use taglib to write that atom, it disappears and resets to zero. the critical part is line 495 else if name.size == 4 { data.append rendertext name.data string::latin1 , it->second ; } whereas i think it would be reasonable for it to go with line 479 else if name == tmpo || name == \251mvi || name == \251mvc { data.append renderint name.data string::latin1 , it->second ; }
