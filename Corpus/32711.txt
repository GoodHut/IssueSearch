BODY : i'm wondering what happened to the plans for 2.0? i read something about it years ago but didn't get more than a beta version. on github i even can't find a repository or brand... latest news i could find were postet in november 2015... i'm using dwoo in many projects and love the simplicity. but i hoped for new features and maybe better efficiency.
