 URL : "https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-frontend/issues/345" TITLE : revisit esc navigation BODY : hitting the esc key used to bring the user back after drilling down into a more detailed view in the insights ui. for example in the actions page one could open a category and then a specific rule after which esc could be used to go one level higher. this still works in some places but it's missing in others. let's revisit this to make it consistent.
