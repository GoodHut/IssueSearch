 URL : "https://github.com/FrDH/jQuery.mmenu/issues/831" TITLE : usage with bootstrap BODY : just wondering if you have any examples of mmenu working with bootstrap? i've seen the bootstrap framework wrappers docs but its not clear to me what the javascript fixes do. ideally i'd like to see an example of how to instantiate an mmenu on a bootstrap menu and which options should be enabled.
