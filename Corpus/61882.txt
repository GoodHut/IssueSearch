 URL : "https://github.com/SuperV1234/SSVOpenHexagon/issues/141" TITLE : build on debian testing BODY : hi! it took me quite some time to get this built on debian testing stretch , but now i somewhat succeeded. i don't know all steps anymore, since i tried a lot, but here are some things i did that were not mentioned in the readme: sudo apt-get install liblua5.3-dev cd ssvopenhexagon cd extlibs git clone https://github.com/superv1234/ssvcmake.git cd .. cmake . make cp ssvopenhexagon _release/. then i was able to run the game. correct me, if i forgot something : i know, that this is probably not the recommended way of building, but after several hours of tinkering i'm okay with that :d also the readme is outdated. it could really use a fresh workover : anyway thank you for this wonderful game. i wish it was packaged in debians repos :/
