 URL : "https://github.com/cobwebch/external_import/issues/8" TITLE : refactor importer class BODY : introduce the notion of steps through which the import process goes and dispatch the existing importer code into the relevant steps. looking at the current code, the default steps would be: - read data - transform data - store data - clear cache this raises the possibility of introducing custom steps, which would be defined in the ctrl configuration, making them unique to each import process. this is better targeted than hooks, in which you always had to check for table and index to be sure you were acting on the right configuration. existing hooks will be maintained for backward-compatibility, but some might be removed in the future as they might seem less relevant.
