 URL : "https://github.com/madskristensen/PackageInstaller/issues/22" TITLE : can't find typings BODY : installed product versions - visual studio: 2017 professional - this extension: 2.0.99 description upon opening the developer command prompt and typing npm install typings -g as specified in the directions, it seems to install typings, but it is not available in the path and the extension can't find it either. is there something else i should be doing to get this to work? it would be nice if it installed all the package managers along with this extension- it feels kind of broken that out-of-the-box it won't work unless you take a bunch of additional steps.
