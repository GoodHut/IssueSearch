 URL : "https://github.com/lukejpreston/junit_viewer/issues/39" TITLE : printing is truncated BODY : hi, i have just discovered junit-viewer and from what i can see in the demo http://lukejpreston.github.io/junit_viewer/demo.html , the functionalities are great. one thing i am missing is the ability to print the report e.g. to pdf . specifically, the problem is the presence of the inner scroll bar on the right in the suites_container element, which causes the print to be truncated when there are many tests. changing the height of this element from 516px to 100% fixes this behavior and i suggest it should be the default. cheers, florent
