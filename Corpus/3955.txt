 URL : "https://github.com/RTMotion/Human-Motion-Alarm/issues/1" TITLE : a bit to bulky BODY : right now where it stands is that it seems a bit to bulky to be able to sit on luggage or my instrument case. eventually i want to be able make a protective shell so it doesn't break if it takes a tumble. at my current state i can still do that but fitting it to luggage with that much bulk makes me nervous. a way i can fix this is that i going to have to make a board to hold the components for the motion sensor and stick the board right on top of the arduino that will cut down the bulk of the alarm dramatically. or i can keep the breadboard re-position the whole thing over the arduino make a seperate compartemnt for it and wire accordingly.
