 URL : "https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/bitflags/issues/113" TITLE : support empty bitflags BODY : in nix we have some datatypes that we created with bitflags! , but since they're cross-platform, not all platforms support all flags. in fact, some platforms support none. instead of having different declarations of the entire type per-target, it'd be nicer if bitflags! supported no entries. for example, then we could implement the following and it would compile on even non-linux targets: bitflags! pub struct sockflag: c_int { cfg target_os = linux sock_nonblock; cfg target_os = linux sock_cloexec; } ;
