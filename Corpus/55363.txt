 URL : "https://github.com/sharmalab/bindaas/issues/8" TITLE : instructions - symlink BODY : the instructions on the downloads http://imaging.cci.emory.edu/wiki/display/bds/downloads page say: > the general practice is to create a new directory for every version under /opt and have /opt/bindaas symlink point to the current version. the problem is that most likely the user will have to run startup.sh from the actual folder; _not_ the symlink. otherwise when they try to go to their dashboard open http://localhost:8080/dashboard/administration , it won't work.
