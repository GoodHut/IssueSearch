 URL : "https://github.com/StreisandEffect/discussions/issues/48" TITLE : streisand share network BODY : finally just got this setup and using just the openvpn config so far. i'm using a msdn azure cloud tied to an identity. upon first connection, noticed that both amazon and gmail didn't 'trust' me and required 2fa. there goes my anonymity - the analytic networks are too advanced to hope this doesn't get passed on to other collectors. and i'm sure it's worse in places like china, iran, etc. what's something we can do to create a peer-to-peer / share network of streisand servers with minimal setup? we need some sort of trust-ring to avoid singing into the same vpn server. or is this what tor is supposed to accomplish? i'm not yet familiar with that, and will take a look.
