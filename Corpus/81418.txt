 URL : "https://github.com/torch/image/issues/213" TITLE : writing 16-bit png files BODY : hi there, thanks to @krasin pr 76 , the module supports the reading of 16bit png files. as far as i can tell, it is however not true yet for the writing. i am alas not familiar with the generic/png.c https://github.com/torch/image/blob/master/generic/png.c code, but it seems that passed images are automatically converted to 8bit format before writing cf. l.208 https://github.com/torch/image/blob/master/generic/png.c l208 and l.269 https://github.com/torch/image/blob/master/generic/png.c l269 .
