 URL : "https://github.com/jeffkaufman/trycontra/issues/11" TITLE : wisconsin 53705 missing BODY : i'm not sure if it's an error in the caller-zips.json file or one of the other steps, but the madison, wi zip 53705 doesn't seem to propagate to the caller heatmap. 53703, the madison dance, does; and that's more pertinent. but i thought you'd want to know there's a bug somewhere. 53705 is the last zip in the list. if it's how i'm passing you the caller zips, let me know and i'll change my protocol.
