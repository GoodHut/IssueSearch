 URL : "https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow-jsonapi/issues/72" TITLE : support link objects BODY : from http://jsonapi.org/format/ document-links: each member of a links object is a “link”. a link must be represented as either: - a containing the link’s url. - an object “link object” which can contain the following members: href: a string containing the link’s url. meta: a meta object containing non-standard meta-information about the link. currently the library supports the first option but not the second. i will be creating a pr for the second, i just wanted to create a ticket to reference first.
