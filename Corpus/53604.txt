 URL : "https://github.com/blox/blox/issues/197" TITLE : enable etcd compaction BODY : currently, the cluster-state-service stores the entire ecs event-stream in etcd. over time, this can add up to quite a bit of data. we should enable automatic etcd compaction by either enabling the --auto-compaction-retention=hours flag on the etcd service, or by creating a job that periodically compacts etcd.
