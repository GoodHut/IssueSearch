 URL : "https://github.com/amireh/happypack/issues/166" TITLE : latest 4.0.0-beta.1 hangs BODY : after upgrade to the latest beta, some of our builds started runing for hours, keeping node.js instances up, with zero activity. no errors fired. can't identify the reason, but looks like some callbacks or exit codes are not processed correctly. downgrading to the 3.1.0 fixes the issue.
