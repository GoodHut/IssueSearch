 URL : "https://github.com/prakhar1989/docker-curriculum/issues/69" TITLE : swarm related issue BODY : hi, i tried running on a swarm and it works well too. there is just one issue: if restart by es containers, the foodtrucksweb container also requires a restart. without that i can ofcrse launch the page, but the searches dont work and it gives error cant reach elasticsearch . i checked by stepping into the foodtruckcontainer on the swarm and doing a curl from their using ip of my es container on the overlay-network. that works fine! i understand that this is not a tutorial on swarm. but would you happen to have any insight into this? to me it seems more of any app setup issue than docker swarm issue. thanks much, sn
