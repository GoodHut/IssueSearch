 URL : "https://github.com/Praqma/git-tollgate-plugin/issues/15" TITLE : add a readme file BODY : @madsnielsen @praqma-thi @buep - who owns this repo? please make absolutely sure that this initiative is aligned with the ambition in git-phlow poke @groenborg , that some commands are _agent commands_ - expected to run on agents concourse workers, jenkins slaves, teamcity workers, bla, bla, bla... the idea with the agent-commands is, that no matter how you wanna implement pretested ingtegration pip . at the end of the day, it boils down to a handful of git commands. we have ordered these commands nicely in batches and made them available - so if you wanna implement a pip - just install the git-phlow extension and run a few commands. @groenborg and @sharor already implement a concourse extension https://github.com/praqma/concourse-git-phlow that utilizes the git phlow. and despite the fact that concourse workers don't support the need for additional git-extensions installed - simon and david did it anyway, by providing the functions of git-phlow, as a library that was imported; it's still the same code base! if we're not careful - and collaborate - we might end up reimplementing stuff - stuff that ought to be shared and jointly developed. so the very short message is: _ this repo needs a readme.md file! who owns this repo? _ ...who ever get's to own this, will have to carefully and respectfully coordinate with concourse-git-phlow https://github.com/praqma/concourse-git-phlow pretested-integration-plugin https://github.com/praqma/pretested-integration-plugin teamcity-merge https://github.com/debitoor/teamcity-merge ...allan ebdrup poke: @ebdrup from debitoor, implemented the exact same features for teamcity based on our model - there's room for collaboration here too!
