 URL : "https://github.com/vahidk/EffectiveTensorflow/issues/12" TITLE : tf.name_scope & variables BODY : tensorflow introduces two different context managers to alter the name of tensors and variables. the first is tf.name_scope which modifies the name of tensors: this sentence might mean that tf.name_scope does not modify the name of variables. however, when tf.variable constructor is called the name of variable is also altered. with tf.name_scope scope : a = tf.get_variable name= a , shape= print a.name prints a:0 b = tf.constant 1, name= b print b.name prints scope/b:0 c = tf.variable tf.zeros , name= c print c.name prints scope/c:0 what do you think, is this point worth to be included in your wonderful guide?
