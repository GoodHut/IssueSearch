 URL : "https://github.com/campsych/concerto-platform/issues/140" TITLE : home page is not showing BODY : i've been following through the linux setup guide and writing revisions for it as i had a plethora of issues, likely stemming from dependency updates here and there, and i'm on the home stretch but i'm stuck and i can't seem to google my way out of this one. when i load up my website, it simply displays the contents of /var/www/vhosts/concerto/web: app.php, app_dev.php, etc if i append /admin to the url, it simply directs me to a generic /admin not found on this server page. i'm currently running on ubuntu server 16.04.02, and have included my apache2.conf and my sites-available config. if anyone could tell me how i can fix this, i would be very appreciative, and i could finish my wiki revisions to give back. thank you for your time. <script src= https://gist.github.com/rby813/947535e6de25608683b5aa4d82ab00f6.js ></script> <script src= https://gist.github.com/rby813/f11881a0f0b842da8b16691d1bacf068.js ></script>
