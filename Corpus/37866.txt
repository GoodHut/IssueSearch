 URL : "https://github.com/p2/OAuth2/issues/177" TITLE : navigation bar style BODY : hello, is there a way to change the color of the navigation bar of the 0auth controller ? in my app i have a lot of social networks and i would like to set the main social network color for the navigation bar for each social network. i think the better way to deal with it is to set something in oauth2.authconfig.ui , like : oauth2.authconfig.ui.controllercolor = uicolor.black what do you think about it ? if you are ok with this implementation, i can make a pull request with this feature.
