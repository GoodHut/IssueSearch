 URL : "https://github.com/ICT4SD/Tools4CLEWS/issues/2" TITLE : help debugging python code BODY : dear @ict4sd community, would anyone have time to assist my colleague @chakchak1234 with this issue, which is related to data analytics for sustainable development. read on.. _ i built an automated etl process that uses selenium to clicks through and downloads every unique combination of crops and its parameters from a country, extracts the .ascii text file from each downloaded zipped folder, and re-saves the file as a .csv and renames it as a function of its unique crop parameters combination. however, when the for loop runs into a combination that yields no data, the function runs into an error and ceases to run mainly because selenium can't click to the next stage of the website . to remedy this issue, i tried to incorporate an if statement that skips the current iteration and moves to the next iteration if it detects text on the website that says no data . however, i'm unsure with how to write the argument in selenium that detects the aforementioned no data element without the selenium driver first being opened.Â  if it helps, this is what the code looks like in html:_ <img src= images/ews/w.png alt= ! /> --> <span>no data</span> </div> </div> this is his code: https://github.com/chakchak1234/data_aggregation_-fao-/blob/master/automated_interactive_etl_country-wide_data.py to get a larger scope in how the code applies, please refer to the repository https://github.com/chakchak1234/data_aggregation_-fao- _for example, every downloaded zipped file is saved in the download folder, which is further processed and stored in the csv folder._ i would appreciate any help! jorge
