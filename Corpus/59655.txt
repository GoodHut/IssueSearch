 URL : "https://github.com/fredrik-johansson/mpmath/issues/370" TITLE : update version on pypi BODY : i have no idea how to get a new version onto pypi. the setup.py upload is deprecated, the web interface gives me an error message, and i can't run twine because of some obscure dependency version conflict. i'd be happy if someone else could just take over maintenance of the project on pypi.
