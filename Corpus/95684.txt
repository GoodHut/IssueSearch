BODY : when connecting to a p4 target, how can i get the status of the target online or offline ? rpc is successed? or sending message in stream channel is successed? i think there should be a hello-like message in p4runtime api defination. at the beginning, sending a hello mesage by write rpc, then the grpc server will response a message with success or failure. ! default https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22718365/29121674-177b7b4e-7d42-11e7-99fc-fcc38a07d8ae.png
