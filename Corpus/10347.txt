 URL : "https://github.com/andersju/noreferrer/issues/2" TITLE : can be bypassed? BODY : hi! i noticed this line at https://github.com/andersju/noreferrer/blob/master/class-noreferrer.php l86: $text = preg_replace_callback '/< area|a|img|iframe .+? >/i', array $this, 'add_referrer_callback' , $text ; the space in the middle caught my attention. i cannot safely activate noreferrer in my blog right now due to 1 but i wonder if <a tab href= foo.html >foo</a> would slip through, unprotected.
