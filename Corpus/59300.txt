 URL : "https://github.com/strinking/statbot/issues/40" TITLE : track guild membership BODY : right now we don't really have a good way of checking if a person is a member of a guild. you _can_ lookup in role_membership when the guild id matches joining on the roles table to find the @everyone role, but that's a huge pain, and since role information is preserved even for people who leave, it's not totally accurate. so instead a separate table for tracking guild-specific data should be made.
