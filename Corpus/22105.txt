 URL : "https://github.com/dangvd/ksmoothdock/issues/2" TITLE : implements a pager BODY : ksmoothdock 4.x had a pager with mini desktop wallpapers as icons, so we could implement one for ksmoothdock 5. this is low priority because plasma 5 by default doesn't use virtual desktops/pager. need to find out: - how to get desktop wallpaper? in kde3, we could use dcop but plasma 5 dbus doesn't seem to provide it. we might need to parse plasma 5 config file.
