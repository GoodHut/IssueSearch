 URL : "https://github.com/nicehash/NiceHashMinerLegacy/issues/272" TITLE : ewbf cannot set solver 0 BODY : pretty much what the subject is. i'm unable to set solver 0 in ewbf. solver 1 works just fine but i'm trying to see which solver actually consistently is the fastest on my hardware and when i see solver 0 get chosen on auto mode it seems to be the fastest.
