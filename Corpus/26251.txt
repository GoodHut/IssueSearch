 URL : "https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/2343" TITLE : aiohttp 3.0 release BODY : i'd like to name the next release 3.0 3.0 means the major. let's drop python 3.4 and use async/await everywhere. another important question is what 3.5 release to cut off? honestly i want to support 3.5.3+ only: the release fixes well known ugly bug for asyncio.get_event_loop . debian stable has shipped with python 3.5.3, not sure about rhel. all other distributions with faster release cycle support 3.5.3 too at least or event 3.6. the transition should not be done at once. 1. let's pin minimal required python version first in setup.py . 2. translate test suite to use async/await . 3. modify aiohttp itself to use new syntax. every bullet except number one could be done in a long series of prs, part by part. btw at the end i hope to get minor performance increase :
