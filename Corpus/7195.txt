 URL : "https://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-json/issues/32" TITLE : empty json keys BODY : there seems to be a problem with handling of empty json object keys. given the following valid json object: json { : a , b : c } in a file named test.json , doing import foo from './test.json'; results in the following invalid code being generated: js var = a ; var b = c ; var foo = { : , b: b }; i stumbled upon this working with jed http://messageformat.github.io/jed/ , which uses empty object keys in its locale data format.
