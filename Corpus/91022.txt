 URL : "https://github.com/cfpb/capital-framework/issues/545" TITLE : support large text labels BODY : current behavior - the labels of checkboxes are created with a-label and assume a rather short label, however, there are instances where the label is multiple paragraphs of text with a link, which makes the behavior of checking the label to check the box less desirable. expected behavior - this is up for discussion. is there an invisible label for 408 compliance or an aria-label attribute? and the text is not clickable for clicking the label. steps to replicate behavior 1. visit step three of the complaint intake form consumerfinance.gov/complaint 2. see the checkbox after the text input that has two paragraphs and a link. screenshots __current__ ! screen shot 2017-07-21 at 6 17 04 pm https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/704760/28484519-e2f971ce-6e40-11e7-8dd7-285386292896.png
