 URL : "https://github.com/NYUCCL/psiTurk/issues/280" TITLE : typo in the docs BODY : hi, there's is a typo in the api section of the docs: https://psiturk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html psiturk-savedata-callbacks the header is psiturk.save d ata when it should be psiturk.save d ata. i often find myself making this error because i think this causes the sidebar to be incorrect as well. sorry, for making an issue instead of just doing a pull request, but i'm not really familiar with sphinx.
