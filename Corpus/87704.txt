 URL : "https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/3413" TITLE : make deque subscriptable? BODY : mypy doesn't let you write deque int etc., but the recommended replacement typing.deque is not present in python 3.6.0 typing: py from collections import deque def f x: 'deque int ' -> none: pass deque not subscriptable, use typing.deque maybe we should allow the above example since typing.deque may be unavailable at runtime. alternatively, we could modify the message to recommend using something like this: py mypy = false if mypy: from typing import deque .... however, the above is pretty unintuitive. type_checking is not present in earlier versions of typing so it's not always an option, but we could perhaps recommend it. zulip hit this issue recently.
