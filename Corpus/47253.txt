 URL : "https://github.com/tomav/docker-mailserver/issues/470" TITLE : opendkim sign headers BODY : hello. there is the problem with amazon ses if you use manual dkim â€“ it wants not you to sign: message-id date return-path bounces-to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/developerguide/manual-dkim.html by default opendkim signs h=list-id:from:to:subject:list-unsubscribe:date; . so maybe there should be the way to override opendkim.conf if it exists or put only allowed headers to signheaders and oversignheaders by default?
