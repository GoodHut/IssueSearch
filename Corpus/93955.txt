 URL : "https://github.com/thumbor/remotecv/issues/15" TITLE : avoid version limitations? BODY : hi, i would like to package remotecv as rpm for centos7 distribution, like i did with thumbor. unfortunately, the project uses specific version dependencies, which might be a roadblock for possible security fixes that might arise into future. i think the queued detection is very cool and beneficial for large scale thumbor setups which use redis as storage backend.. is there a way to update the project and remove the dependencies which does not allows us use the latest versions of python-redis, python-pyres and python-argparse? regards, floren
