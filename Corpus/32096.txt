 URL : "https://github.com/ManuelDeLeon/viewmodel-react/issues/34" TITLE : tracker and next vm BODY : i thought about your proposal to remove tracker from viewmodel for performance. why not just putting it as a separate plugin for viewmodel so we just upgrade vm version but can still support tracker inside vm if we install the plugin? maybe i am na√Øve to technical considerations so tell me if this is feasible? this would avoid backward compatibility breaks and would allow a nicer syntax for all meteor users not concerned about performance that much.
