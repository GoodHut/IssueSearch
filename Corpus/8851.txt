 URL : "https://github.com/GoTeamEpsilon/OpenEMR-AWS-Guide/issues/16" TITLE : secure linux os BODY : so we'll be using the amazon linux ami. probably the most common one people use. look at the questions below. eventually jeffrey you'll find a way to secure/harden the instance, and then i guess 1 . i can write a bash script for it / incorporate it in the cf template? or 2 . maybe we'll make our own ami? questions: - does this default aws linux ami instance need to be hardened? - if so how? - are you supposed to mess with the iptables since i'm already creating security groups, acls, vpns, etc? - how does patching work? i think the instance just auto-updates? does that change if we harden it? - should we use one of the hardened linux images on the marketplace? i see some on there for 1 cent and 2 cent an hour. - i know when i was reading the openemr guide it had some good things maybe they are really obvious to you though to do. one of them was restricting access to the apache logs file. another one was configuring of apache. - should we even be using apache? what about nginx? - other stuff...
