BODY : i have a sonoff b1 with stock firmware, and have been trying to enter ap mode in order to test sonota with it. but so far i have not been able to enter this mode and detect itead-xxxxxx access point. pairing mode 3 off/on cycles does not start a new ap. i've tried different counts of off/on cycles, but no luck so far. is there a way to enter ap mode? thanks.
