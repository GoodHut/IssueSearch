 URL : "https://github.com/oracc/nammu/issues/303" TITLE : test build against java 9 BODY : there's a new version of java which was released this last summer. we found this out when trying to build with maven on anastasis laptop which has java 9. we found the javadoc plugin was not compatible with java 9, and the maven-compiler-plugin needs some extra configuration. @ageorgou knows more about this. we'll need to: - set up tests in travis to run java 9. - change pom.xml with anastasis latest changes and make sure those work also in java 8. - update readme which has some references to java 8 accordingly. it doesn't have much priority for now since it only affected development work and not users.
