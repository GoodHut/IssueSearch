i'm encountering some issues when using the 'insert media' feature of the ckeditor. 1. it seems like the properties alignment, height, width, border, padding, etc. i set are not being displayed properly after the page is saved. 2. on the 'embedding image' window screenshot attached when the cursor hovers over the submit and cancel buttons, the cursor switches from pointer arrow to text cursor | . 3. support request is there a format option that allows me to insert a reduced-sized image that automatically links to an original-sized image? example page: http://antkey.org/content/lucid-key-0 thanks! attachments: - https://github.com/naturalhistorymuseum/scratchpads2/blob/issue-attachments/192/embedding-figure-screenshot.jpg
