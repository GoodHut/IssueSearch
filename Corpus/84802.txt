 URL : "https://github.com/larsga/Duke/issues/242" TITLE : document test file format BODY : using the genetic algorithm to create configurations is very helpful, however it would be nice if the test file format was documented. looking at this example: https://github.com/larsga/duke/blob/dda63901a144a624ed7d68e3a17cc9403d77a70e/doc/example-data/countries-test.txt it seems the format is match + / non match - id1 id2 ??? what is the last value?
