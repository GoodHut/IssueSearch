 URL : "https://github.com/lizadams/emf/issues/48" TITLE : view inventory data BODY : i am confused about this statement. note that the multi-pollutant max emission reduction strategy type the inventory filter has been moved from the inventories tab to the constraints tab. for the multi-pollutant max emission reduction strategy it is possible to specify the inventory filter different for each target pollutant instead at the strategy level. note that within the inventory filter, either upper or lower case may be used to refer to the column names and for the sql keywords; the specified values within single quotes, however, are case sensitive e.g., 'nox' is different from 'nox' . adding an inventory filter will not have an effect on the strategy until the strategy is run. i am going to change it as follows: note: for the multi-pollutant max emission reduction strategy type the inventory filter has been moved from the inventories tab to the constraints tab. you are currently viewing the least cost curve strategy at this point in the exercise, so you won't be able to see that the inventory filter has been moved for the multi-pollutant max emission reduction strategy it is possible to specify the inventory filter different for each target pollutant instead at the strategy level. note that within the inventory filter, either upper or lower case may be used to refer to the column names and for the sql keywords; the specified values within single quotes, however, are case sensitive e.g., 'nox' is different from 'nox' . adding an inventory filter will not have an effect on the strategy until the strategy is run.
