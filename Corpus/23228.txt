 URL : "https://github.com/calamares/calamares/issues/871" TITLE : oem mode installer BODY : submission type - bug report - x feature request kde neon would like to recreate the oem feature that exists in ubiquity the first step is a normal install but which, when it is started with a given environment variable, pre-sets the user stage to create a user called oem with auto-login enabled. the oem then reboots and configures the system how they want and runs a script oem-prepare which sets up the system so when it is shut down and restarted it runs ubiquity/calamares in setup mode which as discussed runs the timezone, language and user setup module plus deletes the existing user.
