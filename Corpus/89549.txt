 URL : "https://github.com/pimax/fb-messenger-php/issues/101" TITLE : quick reply breaking call BODY : when i add quick replies to a message without a payload or image_url, the call does not go through. to fix this i had to create a quickreplybutton like this: new quickreplybutton 'text', 'sample test here', '', '' this has two extra blank strings to override the default null s in the function call. if you make the defaults as empty strings from the constructor itself, this should fix the issue.
