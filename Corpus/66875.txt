 URL : "https://github.com/CocoaPods/cocoadocs.org/issues/531" TITLE : not able to install pod BODY : are you making an issue for cocoadocs the service? then delete this template are you here to write a my pod xxx isn't showing? here's some first steps: first up, load up the expected url in cocoadocs. the url will look like http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/ pod / http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/scconfiguration/ if you get a 404 then that means cocoadocs could not parse your library. as a rule of thumb, cocoadocs is stable and works. the most common problem with generating documentation is that your library crashes either appledoc http://appledoc.gentlebytes.com/appledoc/ or jazzy https://github.com/realm/jazzy . this tends to happen when you use bleeding edge features in betas of xcode. however, sometimes it can just happen generating all this documentation is a complex process, as most swift libs need to be compiled and xcode it a tough dependency to have. the 404 page on cocoadocs.org offers a button to request that cocoadocs takes a second look at running your library, the url for this is http://api.cocoadocs.org:4567/redeploy/ pod /latest nope://hah cocoadocs also offer a way to see errors from cocoadocs related to a pod. the url for this http://api.cocoadocs.org:4567/error/ podname / version http://api.cocoadocs.org:4567/error/scconfiguration/1.0.0 . you'll get a 404 if there's no logged errors. you can find out a bit more about cocoadocs in the pod authors readme http://cocoadocs.org/readme/ . if all of this fails, check for existing issues: https://github.com/cocoapods/cocoadocs.org/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=is%3aissue%20docs%20 finally, if there's nothing specific to your problem, delete this template and start your issue. :+1:
