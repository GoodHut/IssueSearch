 URL : "https://github.com/nlplab/brat/issues/1241" TITLE : watch breaks brat BODY : this is really strange. i have a bunch of documents that sometimes don't load and causes the brat ui to become inaccessible hover over the title bar doesn't do anything and text doesn't load . i managed to trigger this by typing in a single word into a document. my document looks like watch without any new lines or additional whitespace. watch seems to work. any document that contains the phrase watch fails to load.
