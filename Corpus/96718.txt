 URL : "https://github.com/erikras/redux-form/issues/3375" TITLE : field normalizing is buggy BODY : are you submitting a bug report or a feature request ? bug report. what is the current behavior? sometimes, field normalization is not triggered. what is the expected behavior? field normalization is triggered on every change. sandbox link https://codesandbox.io/s/l8kwerjdw what's your environment? redux form v6.8.0, google chrome 60.0.3112.113, node v8.4.0. other information field normalization can be bypassed by drag n' dropping value of a field into another. when doing that, normalization is not triggered on the target field. this is how you can reproduce the behavior using the link above: 1. write something to _shout_ field. as you're writing the value, it should be capitalized, as expected. 2. select the value of _shout_ field and drag n' drop it into _username_ field. after doing that, value of the _username_ field is not converted to lowercase, which is an unexpected behavior. there're no errors in the console and the form can be submitted just fine.
