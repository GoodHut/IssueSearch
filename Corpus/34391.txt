 URL : "https://github.com/OpenMath/OMSTD/issues/8" TITLE : cdcomment in cdgroup BODY : according to david carlisle >the comment has to come before the cd entry not after. in an ideal world the comment would be inside the cdgroupmember entry but we'd already shipped openmath 2.0 or 1.0? only allowing comments at the outer level in cdgroup files, and with cdgroups with no such comments before i needed them to make a reasonable web index page, and so we went with adding them immediately before each entry. we should really fix this in a new revision of the standard.
