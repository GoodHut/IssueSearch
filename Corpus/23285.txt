 URL : "https://github.com/betaflight/blackbox-log-viewer-ng/issues/7" TITLE : option to save log BODY : hello, i would like to do some advanced data analysis on logs in python. some time ago, the only files available were some i found on forums. i was able to convert some of these via the blackbox-decode tool. now i finally got my own quad with f4 bf3.1 fc and can log my own data. unfortunately bf3.1 saves as .bfl files and is ot supported by the outdated blackbox decode tool. luckily the blackbox-log-viewer accepts the .bfl files and displays the data. it would be really awsome, if there would be some kind of save/export function within the program! it is completely sufficient to save all data traces to a .csv or .txt file. a simple header line with the trace name and done. this will make advanced data analysis on logs easily possible for everyone interested. finally these methods could be worthy beeing added to the log viewer! thanks, flo
