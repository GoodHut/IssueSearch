 URL : "https://github.com/ferreusveritas/Dynamic-Trees/issues/9" TITLE : no sprinting on leaves BODY : with the changes to leave functionality you can't traverse a roofed forest anymore. you get slowed down when moving, can't sprint and issues arise simply jumping up leaf blocks. it feels similar to going down ladders without the climbing and in every direction. preferably this effect would only kick in from a height you would take fall damage from. this would allow normal traversing of trees and the regular use of leaf blocks for things like scaffolding.
