 URL : "https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-workstation/issues/20" TITLE : add a research vm BODY : one additional vm we talked about during the scoping of this project was a research vm, intended for journalists to use to do research about submissions they receive. in this vm, there would not be strict controls on what kind of files one can open as in sd-journalist . we do not want journalists to use the sd-journalist vm for anything other than accessing submissions and downloading them, so we'll have to provide another place for them to do this. this might just be one of the vms provided in the default vms one can accept during the qubes install, but we should be explicit about this if so. i think we should avoid reusing the sd-whonix netvm for the research vm since it stores the aths token for the journalist interface.
