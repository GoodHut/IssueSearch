 URL : "https://github.com/richvdh/gnupod/issues/1" TITLE : ffmpeg -formats and alac BODY : gnupod_addsong.pl --decode=aac song.flac fails with gnupod_addsong.pl version 0.99.9-devel c adrian ulrich can't use 'defined @array ' maybe you should just omit the defined ? at /usr/bin/gnupod_convert_flac.pl line 126. skipping 'song.flac', unknown file type done looking at the lines 124-126 in gnupod_convert_flac.pl it seems that maybe ffmpeg changed how it outputs supported codecs and muxers, because ffmpeg -formats now outputs the first column in de format and not dea format, and -formats does not have any line containing 'alac', but -codecs does. forcing line 126 to return 1 ; works, but it is a dirty kludge and not a proper bugfix as i don't know any perl, so i cannot fix it myself .
