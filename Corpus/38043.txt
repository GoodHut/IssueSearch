 URL : "https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyCall.jl/issues/382" TITLE : no module named site BODY : when i try: pkg.build pydstool info: building conda info: building pycall fetching package metadata ... .. ...... solving package specifications: . . ........ all requested packages already installed. packages in environment at c:\users\chris\.julia\v0.5\conda\deps\usr: numpy 1.12.1 py27_0 info: pycall is using c:\users\chris\.julia\v0.5\conda\deps\usr\python.exe python 2.7.13 at c:\users\chris\.julia\v0.5\conda\deps\usr\python.exe, libpython = c:\users\chris\.julia\v0.5\conda\deps\usr\python27 info: c:\users\chris\.julia\v0.5\pycall\deps\deps.jl has not changed info: c:\users\chris\.julia\v0.5\pycall\deps\python has not changed info: building pydstool importerror: no module named site it fails on windows. but i can copy/paste the build script julia conda.add scipy conda.add_channel conda-forge conda.add pydstool it works. it seems this is a very common issue on windows: https://github.com/juliadiffeq/differentialequations.jl/issues/149 the common solution is julia pkg.pin pycall ,v 1.11.0 so i think one of those changes must've caused this.
