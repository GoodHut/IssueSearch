 URL : "https://github.com/battlecode/battlecode-scaffold-2017/issues/17" TITLE : gradle + offline = bad BODY : i am currently traveling and i have spotty access to internet at best. while i had internet last i made sure everything was up to date and working, but when i opened eclipse later that day, no luck. reading through the gradle output it is failing because it cannot update from the battlcode server. i can appreciate wanting to keep everything up to date, but could it at least fall back to the previously downloaded dependencies? alternatively, could someone show me how to temporarily edit the the config so i can work offline until i get internet again?
