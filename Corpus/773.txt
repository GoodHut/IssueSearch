 URL : "https://github.com/SethTriplett/UberOfCleanWaterM2/issues/1" TITLE : m2 - setup BODY : setup while this part is not going to be graded directly, you will not be able to complete the rest of the lab if you omit it. setup git on your machine with the desired client git for command line, tortisegit for file manager integration, the git software from github or egit for eclipse integration . note that for this semester if you are using netbeans or intelli-j, those already have git support out of the box. note you should name your repository repository if running your own copy of git if using remote hosting like github, then just provide us the url and we will check your code out from there. initialize a new git repository. be sure that your teammates can access the repository also. you will need to work together to complete some portions of this lab. this step is not required if using github hosting download the m2 resource file m2.zip and unzip it import the unzipped files add, commit and push as a new project named m2 only one person has to do this note that the lib directory contains a resources.jar file. this is to simulate a 3d party library you have to link to. you will need to ensure during the lab that this .jar is on the classpath for compilation and execution. create a branch at this point called original. each team member should clone out the project m2 be sure that original remains as the unmodified version and that changes to the branch are done on the main master branch.
