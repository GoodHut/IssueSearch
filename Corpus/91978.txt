 URL : "https://github.com/datproject/dat/issues/621" TITLE : use new live watch module BODY : _from @joehand on january 24, 2017 20:3_ mafintosh made a new module: https://github.com/mafintosh/recursive-watch. this module is better because it only uses one fd to watch all files in a recursive dir. the old module uses one per file. the api and event types in recursive-watch are slightly different from https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar. live watching happens in https://github.com/juliangruber/hyperdrive-import-files. todo: - update https://github.com/juliangruber/hyperdrive-import-files to use new live watch module. - update dat-next with event changes _copied from original issue: joehand/dat-next 96_
