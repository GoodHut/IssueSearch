 URL : "https://github.com/konigio/konig/issues/553" TITLE : equals formula constraint BODY : the shacl specification includes an equals constraint which allows one to assert that the value at the end of one path in a property shape is equal to some other property. this construct is somewhat limited. you can only compare one property path to another path of length 1. i want a more general constraint that allows me to define an arbitrary formula for the value equals constraint. this will allow me to assert the equality of more complex traversals. acceptance criteria there must be a predicate named konig:equalsformula whose value is a formula that produces a value equivalent to the value of property referenced by the subject property shape.
