 URL : "https://github.com/Minecolonies/minecolonies/issues/712" TITLE : automatic view update BODY : we need a way to automatically update the views from the windows. at the moment the windows have old instances of the views and they only update after they've been opened again. there should be a way to do this on the fly. this way we wouldn't have to update the local views manually.
