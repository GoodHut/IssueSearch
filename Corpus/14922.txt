 URL : "https://github.com/resin-io/etcher/issues/1643" TITLE : chrome os version BODY : chrome os is currently lacking a graphical app that allows you to write an iso to a usb stick or sd card. the only way to do it is to enable developer mode and use dd . as etcher uses web technologies it could become the first image writer for chrome os. i don't know how much effort it is to adapt from electron/node.js to the chrome application api.
