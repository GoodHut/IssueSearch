 URL : "https://github.com/joey711/phyloseq/issues/829" TITLE : prepare for ape update BODY : the testing development version of ape can be obtained with the following. r download.packages ape , . , repos = http://ape-package.ird.fr/ some specific changes have been flagged by the ape developers. known failures the update causes a known break to phyloseq via the following internal function. phyloseq:::ape_node_depth_edge_length function ntip, nnode, edge, nedge, edge.length { .c ape:::node_depth_edgelength, package = ape , as.integer ntip , as.integer nnode , as.integer edge , 1 , as.integer edge , 2 , as.integer nedge , as.double edge.length , double ntip + nnode 7 } <environment: namespace:phyloseq> this was an internal c-encoded function in ape borrowed by phyloseq in order to speed up some tree-specific algorithms. from the ape author: > the c code has been changed and other functions too . my recommendation is to use the corresponding r functions: r node.depth.edgelength node.depth node.height > check the options of the last two . this would be easier for you and should be as efficient as the current solution. > since phyloseq is on bioconductor, this is not a problem for me. however, the package htssip on cran fails its check apparently because of this problem. > please update me as necessary: since the next release of ape will break your package on cran, i have to inform them of a possible fix from you. additional details ape update details: https://www.mail-archive.com/r-sig-phylo@r-project.org/msg05046.html ape versions: http://ape-package.ird.fr/ape_installation.html versions
