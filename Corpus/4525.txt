 URL : "https://github.com/slochower/pAPRika/issues/16" TITLE : dir in solvate BODY : setting dir the way we do is probably not a good long term approach. surprised me by trying to execute stuff where i wasn't expecting. we should probably have a pow-wow about how we're gonna deal with directories. os.chdir is can be troublesome .... should every function have an execute_path or something?
