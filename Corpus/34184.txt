 URL : "https://github.com/kristophjunge/docker-mediawiki/issues/4" TITLE : cache sessions in db BODY : > known issues > - sessions are stored in memory via apc and will be lost after container stop. what about using $wgsessioncachetype = cache_db; https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/manual:$wgsessioncachetype in localsettings.php ? according to the docs, this should save session tokens in database and database should be persistent and survive a reboot. i tested it with extralocalsettings.php and it seems to work. i couldn't verify it by 100% it's 3am . fb to your image: keep up the good work! this docker image is absolutely high quality! üëç
