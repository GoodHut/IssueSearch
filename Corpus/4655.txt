 URL : "https://github.com/awjuliani/DeepRL-Agents/issues/41" TITLE : fails to learn BODY : i ran the notebook without any changes on the vizdoom environment. after around an hour the reward became non-negative and peaked at around 0.7, but continuing to run the code resulted in the reward going back to -3.0 i assume the most negative reward possible and remaining stagnant for over 24 hours. a view of the produced gifs shows the agent walking to the left continuously without choosing any other action. i also attempted to change the environment to openai's pong-v0 and have run this for over 24 hours without the average reward improving at all. if anyone knows what variables might be worth changing here i'd be grateful. i'm using 80x80 pong images and allowing for all 6 actions to be chosen. code otherwise is not different apart from of course modifying the 'game' variable to work with the openai environment tested manually - successful .
