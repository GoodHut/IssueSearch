 URL : "https://github.com/DuBistKomisch/nou2ube/issues/1" TITLE : does not clear old videos BODY : i am seeing videos from up to 2 months ago, which i think is also causing it to slow to a crawl when i try to ignore a video. it can take up to 30 seconds to actually remove the listing for the video. would be nice to be able to clear all of the videos.
