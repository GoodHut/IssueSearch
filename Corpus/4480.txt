 URL : "https://github.com/zulip/zulip-electron/issues/319" TITLE : dark gui theme BODY : it would be nice if there was an option for a dark gui so i don't have to stare at so much white light emanating from my screen. @synicalsyntax has made some hacks using stylish https://chat.zulip.org/ narrow/stream/new.20members/subject/dark.20theme.3f/near/299379 in browser, but afaik that's not possible in the electron app. i don't think a full featured theme system with user defined themes is necessary. to the contrary, that's an unnecessary maintenance burden. i propose following how signal implements this with just one light and one dark theme shipped with the application.
