 URL : "https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-php-core/issues/138" TITLE : implement better ordering BODY : if there is a md doc with this: --- order: -5 --- it should sort by that and then name. the default of order is 0 . this is already implemented in the node version and was implemented in this version here: https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-php-core/pull/137 - so that makes order available in the pattern data and ready to implement.
