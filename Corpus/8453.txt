 URL : "https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/issues/289" TITLE : old font theme? BODY : after fixing some small issues https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/pull/288 with the new theme system, i found that the classic theme is not equivalent to the old one. is it on purpose? the font of the new classic theme makes the text hard to read, while the previous old font merriweather was a great font for a theme called classic . i wanted to create an old font theme, but it is not possible to configure the font of the navbar, so it uses the body font merriweather which is not appropriate. hence, it would be great to have the possibility to configure the font of the navbar. and i think it would make sense to also have a font theme called old or similar that represents the previous theme provided in the repository. it would avoid the need to create a new one for those that preferred it. what do you think?
