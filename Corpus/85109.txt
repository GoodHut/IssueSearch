 URL : "https://github.com/sheadawson/silverstripe-userswitcher/issues/11" TITLE : entwine causing weirdness BODY : i believe it has something to do with the $ 'body' .entwine functionality, but it seems to be stopping behaviour from executing when i dynamically ajax elements in on the frontend. to avoid quirks causing timesinks, i think i'll avoid this module until the entwine functions don't mess with core functionality in unpredictable/odd ways.
