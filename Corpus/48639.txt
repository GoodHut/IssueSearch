 URL : "https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues/3918" TITLE : share dialogue broken BODY : when trying to share a file or a folder using the share dialogue i cannot select any users to share with. what should happen: while typing the name of a user the autocompete feature should present a dropdown menu with matching user names. what does happen: not much. no dropdown is shown. only when the string entered does not match a user name a popup is shown saying no users or groups found for daeffsfbsf provided that you enterred daeffsfbsf and there's no such user . the interaction between the client the browser and the server seems to go fine. while typing calls are made to ocs/v1.php/apps/files_sharing/api/v1/sharees?format=json&search=daeffsfbsf&perpage=200&itemtype=folder and the server responds properly a json with any matching users . it seems to go wrong where the client has to display the returned usernames. tested with firefox and safari. using php 7 on the server.
