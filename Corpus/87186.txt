 URL : "https://github.com/teemann/currentcps/issues/2" TITLE : issue with the cp handler BODY : don't know if it's fixed. but we received the following exception: bad operand type for unary -: 'list' signal receiver 'teemann.currentcps' => player_cp thrown an exception! signal receiver 'teemann.currentcps' => player_start thrown an exception! i don't have a full stacktrace unfortunately, it can also be from your development machine, but i'm not sure. from view of some of the logins, it seems to be a real live server .
