 URL : "https://github.com/enonic/xp/issues/5182" TITLE : input type: color picker BODY : this could easily be stamped with wait for custom input type and then implement yourself . but this is really something useful almost all 10+ apps i've built so far , let users control colors using textline for inserting hex-values that i later use in code ... not user friendly . a xp best-practise implementation of a color picker with a color wheel and hex editor as a complement would be a rather quick implementation using existing front end libraries, and also something a lot of developers would find useful. it will give instant gaines in ux for anyone using content studio. having each dev implements this themselves when custom input types comes means users will have to wait loooong, they will have different implementations for the same feature which most cms has already anyway . <input type= color /> lets set the standard for how a color picker should be in xp, and later with custom input types devs needing something more/different can just brew their own instead. two examples on how wordpress does it. most other cmses does something similar. ! screen shot 2017-06-23 at 10 24 10 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1465598/27473110-45d6cb38-57fe-11e7-85bf-597c5be226a6.png ! screen shot 2017-06-23 at 10 24 18 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1465598/27473128-54122a08-57fe-11e7-8c03-234295b79e52.png
