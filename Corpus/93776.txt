 URL : "https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/8648" TITLE : appbar requires a scaffold BODY : it appears that appbar always requires a scaffold . if you try to add an appbar to a widget that doesn't have a scaffold you will get the following error: scaffold.of called with a context that does not contain a scaffold. no scaffold ancestor could be found starting from the context that was passed to scaffold.of . this usually happens when the context provided is from the same statefulwidget as that whose build function actually creates the scaffold widget being sought. the documentation implies that it should be possible to use an appbar outside of a scaffold : /// app bars are typically used in the scaffold.appbar property, which places /// the app bar as a fixed-height widget at the top of the screen. it looks like there are a lot of cases where there are direct references to scaffold.of ... without checks.
