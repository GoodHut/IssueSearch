 URL : "https://github.com/uclaradio/uclaradio/issues/73" TITLE : ucla radio knowledge base BODY : in the 3/7/17 manager's meeting, we discussed an intern suggestion which was having a ucla radio internal wiki! i generalized this issue to a discussion about knowledge bases as wikis aren't the only way knowledge can be stored. we'll use this issue to discuss potential solutions and any concerns. why have a knowledge base? there's a lot of information about how our station is run, but unfortunately the information is all over the place. we rely a lot on bugging people on slack, which leads to some questions not being answered until way later. a knowledge base will serve as a great solution to have all the info about the station in one place. this will also assist in on-boarding new members to the station. we currently have a faq setup in the dj panel, however faq's are limited in the content we can post on it and interns will not have access to it. features we'll need _feel free to edit this post to add any features you think we need or comment them down below_ - wysiwg: non-tech savy users might have issues with following systems that require specific markup - ability to have multiple pages with organization - multiple users can edit it and contribute if this interferes with price, a possible workaround is having a single account shared between everyone - backups are possible so we don't lose all our precious info! - free or ideally free as i'm pretty sure we won't have the budget for this features to discuss _feel free to edit this post to add any features for discussion. use the comments for your opinion_ - self-hosted or hosted by someone else? - public to everyone or password-protected? - should there be different levels of user access? ie people with write-access, people with read-access if you find any cool ways to implement the knowledge base, post them in the comments! also share pros/cons and your thoughts on them.
