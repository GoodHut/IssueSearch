 URL : "https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme/issues/1285" TITLE : supported node version BODY : i recently encountered the following error after updating to v3. error rst-selector-parser@2.2.2: the engine node is incompatible with this module. expected version >=5 . this error was thrown in a node 4 environment and it looks like 1086 switched to rst-selector-parser which only supports node 5+ according to this file https://github.com/aweary/rst-selector-parser/blame/master/package.json l33 . given that node 4 is no longer active node release schedule https://github.com/nodejs/release i am curious if enzyme has officially dropped support for node 4??? if so, would it make sense to update package.json to reflect this?
