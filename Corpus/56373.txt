 URL : "https://github.com/nuxt-community/nuxtent-module/issues/113" TITLE : multiple content types BODY : i must have misunderstood something as i cannot get two content types to work together. i am trying to create both projects and posts with permalinks :slug using the configuration below. i would like the projects to use the page projects/_slug and the posts posts\_slug . however both use posts\_slug giving me a 404 on /project1 as project1 does not exist in the posts collection. full example can be found at https://github.com/raae/nuxtent-test. module.exports = { content: 'projects', { permalink: ':slug', page: 'projects/_slug', ispost: false, generate: // for static build 'get', 'getall' } , 'posts', { permalink: ':slug', page: '/posts/_slug', ispost: false, generate: // for static build 'get', 'getall' } }
