 URL : "https://github.com/Mantaro/MantaroBot/issues/19" TITLE : game command glitched? BODY : there is a glitch where the bot thinks it is in a game, but not only did the end not work, but it's been almost a day and still doesn't timeout. is there a way to reset it so we can play our games again? i tried kicking her and re-adding her, that didn't work either...
