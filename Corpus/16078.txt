 URL : "https://github.com/adcpm/busy/issues/314" TITLE : help files needed BODY : the app is very intuitive in many respects and works great. for users coming from steemit you can guess how it works but for new users especially there is not a lot of help available for example. pop up help when you hover over a button would be helpful a help file that explains the basic navigation such as tags, chat, writing who is listed here? is it just people online etc how to upload photos, basic markdown etc
