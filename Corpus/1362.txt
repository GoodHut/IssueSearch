 URL : "https://github.com/onelittlebecca/pay_gov/issues/4" TITLE : ssl --> tls BODY : was originally using https_drupal api call to have drupal hit the pay.gov servers but there was an issue on our end as our servers are forcing use of tls and we wrote module for ssl. the loop with curl that fixed the handshake issue was supposed to fix the forcing of ssl and force tls, but i think either i didn't add enough cases/switches or ... maybe i left something out in my logic somewhere. i know curl is finicky but it did resolve the handshake error... i dont know. testing on a new server this week with less waf layer rules in theory . open to suggestions.
