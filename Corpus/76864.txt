 URL : "https://github.com/buddhi1980/mandelbulber2/issues/217" TITLE : mandelbulb appearing bug BODY : this is hard to explain but i occasionally have mandelbulbs where none should be. current example: saved a menger as preset, the preset thumbnail is a menger, when i load and render i get the default mandelbulb instead. i view the settings file and the menger is missing. it is a random event. i will continue to monitor for this behavior.
