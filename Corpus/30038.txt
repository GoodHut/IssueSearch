BODY : hi kimlood, i think that it is fantastic that you have spent the time creating this integration. it is a shame that you have had to do it and support it and telldus seems not care about it's user base. i've spend the last couple of hours working with it, but i have hit a block. i have clearly missed something. the request seems to be coming in from my phone, but no devices are found... i've attached the logs from cloudwatch below, but is there somewhere else i should be looking? ! screenshot 2017-01-17 21 09 20 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18058589/22121806/aa1671c2-de85-11e6-89be-54faa0f4d8f1.png thanks josh
