 URL : "https://github.com/skypjack/uvw/issues/99" TITLE : expose type in basehandle BODY : from the libuv docs it appears that uv_handle_t has the ability to provide the type. it would be nice if this was also available in uvw. per docs calling loop->walk on the thread's loop only provides the count and cannot get you back to the handle type. use case: we would like to report periodic stats on the number of open/active handles in a thread grouped by type.
