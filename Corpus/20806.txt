 URL : "https://github.com/Esri/geoportal-server/issues/280" TITLE : csw 2.0.2 endpoint BODY : the current version v2.5.0 of geoportal server appears to only offer a csw 3.0.0 endpoint. unfortunately geonetwork and other applications i assume only offers support for csw 2.0.2 harvesting at this time. this means that our use of geoportal server as a broker between arcgis server and geonetwork has been made impossible by our latest update. are there any plans to add support for a csw 2.0.2 endpoint back in to geoportal server?
