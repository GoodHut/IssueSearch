 URL : "https://github.com/lukasz-wronski/vscode-ftp-sync/issues/145" TITLE : full sync time out? BODY : i have sites with a lot of files about 10.000 . when i do a full sync local to remote, after a while it says run 458x operations now even though collecting remote files hasn't finished yet. after a few second it disapears and collection remote files still goes on. at the end it says run 32 operations now so the earlier operation are not taken into account . if i run them... i get sync error:error failiure. could it be some kind of time-out that generates this issue. if so, can someone fix this...
