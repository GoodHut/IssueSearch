BODY : at the moment every front-end server instance writes a log entry to a single shared rds instance on every request. there is scope to make this shared db server less of a bottleneck by cacheing the log entries locally and then sending them up to the logger db in batches, but we need to be careful not to lose data when dropping an instance out of the cluster.
