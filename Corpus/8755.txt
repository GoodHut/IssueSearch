 URL : "https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-ui/issues/253" TITLE : review api docs BODY : i can see that some api docs violate the rules which i defined in https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-utils/issues/165: > always hide private api under @private/@protected, > never link from public api to private api, > kiss. for example: ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/156149/27124780-67adf302-50f2-11e7-8143-90762433aaf4.png the templates definition is also a bit too complex and divided, but i'm not sure if we can improve it much. also, it'd be good to read all the most important documentation and see if it renders nicely. e.g. i can see that some notations used in code samples break code highlighting and some properties are not well linked or named.
