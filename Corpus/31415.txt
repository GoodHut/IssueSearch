 URL : "https://github.com/gryffon/ringteki/issues/427" TITLE : shosuro actress bug BODY : i attempted to use shosuro actress to bring in my opponent's isawa masahiro. my opponent controlled a isawa masahiro at the time. it wouldn't let me do it, possibly due to a bug in how uniqueness is implemented? he also couldn't drag his isawa masahiro out of the discard to use /give-control, also due to uniquness.
