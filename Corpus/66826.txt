 URL : "https://github.com/gildor/kotlin-coroutines-retrofit/issues/33" TITLE : no response coming back BODY : i'm trying to get a token but nothing is happening. here is my code: fun handlelogin { println about to get token launch { print getting token val token = service.gettoken code = code, verifier = verifier .await print token is $token } } it prints out the about to get token but never prints out the getting token nor the token is $token . i know it's not retrofit because it works when i use the basic enqueue functionality. any ideas?
