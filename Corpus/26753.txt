 URL : "https://github.com/Kender2/swc-squadranking/issues/15" TITLE : can not run locally BODY : hello, first of all, happy new year and a big thank for sharing this project! finally i've found something to help with automatical squad stats something like https://github.com/kender2/swc-squadranking/issues/10 . i've tried to install it locally but it doesn't seem working. here are the steps i can put it into a readme file, if you want i'll open a pr for that : installation - copy .env.example to .env . - run php artisan key:generate to generate app_key. - create an empty database. - update .env file with app_url and db_ values. - run php artisan migrate to create db tables. - run php artisan db:seed to seed initial data. - run php artisan sod:grab-data to start retrieving data. after the db:seed command i've a manifest table with version up to 299. run php artisan sod:grab-data it creates storage/app/manifests/300.json i have to manually mkdir storage/app/manifests - no problem and throws filenotfoundexception on 299.json, which i guess because of: $changes = $newmanifest->compareto manifest::fromfile $currentversion ; it downloads the next-version manifest file, but the current version doesn't exist. again, no problem, i force $currentversion = 300 in that method and it downloads 301.json and compare with 300.json. ok! then i got a runtimeexception because storage/app/data/branch_info.json is not writable. i chmod 755 storage/app/data, but then i got a gitexception saying i want to add that file into git but it is ignored by .gitignore. i then stop here because i don't know why you want to add that file to git. didn't i miss any step?
