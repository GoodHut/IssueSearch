BODY : we removed aria roles in 1132. but wai-aria 1.1 and html 5.1 specifications have been updated. this is the biggest change for aria roles: <blockquote>&lt;header&gt; and &lt;footer&gt; elements will now only be exposed as header and footer, and banner and contentinfo landmarks respectively, if these elements are direct descendants of the body tag, and therefore are scoped for the whole page.</blockquote> in _s header and footer are not direct descendants of the body tag, they are inside page wrapper. my question is, should we bring back <header role= banner > and <footer role= contentinfo > ? here is more information about the aria roles subject https://www.marcozehe.de/2017/08/30/firefox-57-will-less-chatty-screen-readers-situations/ .
