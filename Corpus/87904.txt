 URL : "https://github.com/macroevolution/bammtools/issues/43" TITLE : merge multiple event data BODY : this is a suggestion. after running multiple mcmc or mc3 chains one might want to merge the event data from the posterior distribution of the different runs to increase sample size. would be great to have a function to do this. i tried to do it in the naive way just using 'rbind' of the event data matrix but i ran into some issues. maybe the functions depend on the value for the generation number first column of the event data matrix ?
