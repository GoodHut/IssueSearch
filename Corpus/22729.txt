 URL : "https://github.com/gaelcolas/SampleModule/issues/7" TITLE : merge module specs BODY : the question is broadly: - what and how to merge into single psm1? i can see the following challenges: - some folder structures may be different - some people may add things to their psm1 stub - using statements needs to be gathered/unique'd and inserted at top of psm1 - requires should be added in module manifest except admin - classes should be imported in a certain order where to define it? - classes should be imported before functions - extra data should be merge-able say if you provide a scriptblock? thinking out loud - should the non-merged files be copied? and everything merged deleted, empty dir deleted as well? am i missing anything?
