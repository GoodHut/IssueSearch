 URL : "https://github.com/lppkarl/GoogleCloudPrintApi/issues/22" TITLE : producing printed output BODY : karl, in your latest email to me you said: the lib does not automatically redirect your printed job to your target printer. the proper way is to call the download interface, pull the job from google cloud to the local server, and redirect the downloaded content to the printer through calling the print program maybe a pdf viewer that takes doc as an arg for printing i've tried using your sample application to print something. the most promising way was to choose submit job. i select the printer registered using your register code and selected a plain text file on my machine. i changed the values of the print ticket to match what i think is compatible with the printer. when i run submit job, it looks like a job gets created, and the method returns success = true, but nothing prints. from what you said above, it sounds like the best i can do with the code is to create the print job, but i would need to invoke some other program to actually get the printer to print. the ultimate goal i'm trying to achieve is to get non cloud ready printers registered so that i can put a button on a web application that allows a user to select a printer and get a document printed. it looks like i can get this accomplished, but the registration process is kind of complicated the code for registering is at https://github.com/google/cloud-print-connector . again, i would appreciate your guidance.
