 URL : "https://github.com/MetaMask/provider-engine/issues/110" TITLE : support react native BODY : right now the rpc-subprovider conditionally requires the xhr or request modules depending on the context, but it does not import a react-native solution in that context. if we found a react-native compatible module that exposed a request compatible api, we could swap it in conditionally, and support react native very easily.
