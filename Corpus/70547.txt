 URL : "https://github.com/neomake/neomake/issues/1519" TITLE : whitespace is clobbered BODY : it seems that at some point between command invocation and showing the results in the quickfix pane, whitespace output is clobbered. here's an example of what cargo build outputs to the terminal for a project: rust error e0244 : wrong number of type arguments: expected 0, found 1 --> src/main.rs:41:41 | 41 | fn not_found _: &mut request -> result<request<r>, string> { | ^^^^^^^^^^ expected no type arguments and here's what neomake shows in the quickfix pane when executing the same: rust src/main.rs|41 col 41 error 244| wrong number of type arguments: expected 0, found 1 || | || 41 | fn not_found _: &mut request -> result<request<r>, string> { || | ^^^^^^^^^^ expected no type arguments what's funny/unexpected is that it's not leading whitespace that's being clobbered, but rather whitespace in the middle of the string, which isn't normally what gets lost.
