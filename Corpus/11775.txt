 URL : "https://github.com/GauntCult/prj-rev-bwfs-dasmoto/issues/3" TITLE : keep lines short BODY : your lines are a bit long right now. try splitting this into new lines so it's easier to read on one screen without scrolling. convention is usually ~79 characters per line. itâ€™s an issue of code density. programmers like to have a lot of context when reading code. it is much, much quicker to glance up and down a window than it is to scroll. if you have very long lines, you also tend to have lines that vary in length a lot, leading to a lot of wasted screen real estate and being able to fit less code on screen at a given time overall. https://github.com/gauntcult/prj-rev-bwfs-dasmoto/blob/master/dasmoto's%20arts%20%26%20crafts/index.html l25
