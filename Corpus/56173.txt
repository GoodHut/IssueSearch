 URL : "https://github.com/rtfd/sphinx_rtd_theme/issues/527" TITLE : minimize theme.js file BODY : it seems silly that we just browserify theme.js and just copy it over. we should minimize it like the rest of the static files. i am not sure what the best way to do this is though. perhaps use grunt-contrib-uglify https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-contrib-uglify but not sure how to use that and browserify.
