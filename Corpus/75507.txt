 URL : "https://github.com/sujan-s/fictoan/issues/12" TITLE : how about a npm package? BODY : hello @sujan-s , the fictoan is a great light weighted framework! you really did a great job. btw, doc and class-naming are also great, as good as monologue... why not publish it on the npm as a package? i think my developer will use fictoan if it can be installed quickly with one line. thanks a lot, jie
