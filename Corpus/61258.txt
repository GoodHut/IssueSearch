 URL : "https://github.com/NRGI/resourcedata.org/issues/9" TITLE : always redirect to www. BODY : the server url is set to www.resourcedata.org but resourcedata.org works too. this is a problem for javascript calls which are embedded in the page and talk to www. as this is a different domain we then have cors issues. i.e. the follow button generates this when i am on http://resourcedata.org: xmlhttprequest cannot load http://www.resourcedata.org/api/action/follow_dataset. request header field content-type is not allowed by access-control-allow-headers in preflight response. rather than trying to fix that i would suggest just always redirecting to www.
