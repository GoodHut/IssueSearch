 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push/issues/663" TITLE : updating hybrid apps BODY : we're developing a hybrid native/react-native app: most of our app is native and a few screens are in react-native. as i understand from the documentation, it is currently not possible to update the react-native bundle from within the native app. e.g. the react-native part needs to loaded in order to check for and install updates. is this correct or is there a way to update the bundle from the native code? thanks!
