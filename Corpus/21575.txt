 URL : "https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/issues/2703" TITLE : flight mode lockup BODY : i don't know how often this would actually happen, but i have a second switch that overrides any flight modes for failsafe taranis . i noticed that if i switch the switches primary flight mode switch and failsafe switch , i can get betaflight confused and it locks to one of the modes. further input is ignored and no more led's flickering when mode is changed. maybe nothing, but has anyone else tried this? i am not sure where the threshold is, like how fast you flip the switches or if its number of times.... but getting stuck in a mode is disconcerting..... j
