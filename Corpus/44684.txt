 URL : "https://github.com/vanilla/vanilla/issues/5141" TITLE : fix broken hhvm build BODY : i noticed the hhvm build was broken. a dev is going to have to go and troubleshoot the build and see what's wrong. i recommend going to https://github.com/vanilla/travis-nginx-test to see if something about travis broke and how we can get it fixed. this was always the risk when marking hhvm optional. @linc should have a monthly task of making sure the hhvm build works or else we'll need to make it required again.
