BODY : hi all, i'd like to just run up an example first without sip setting. i've settled down appdelegate.m already. app has been compiled and build successfully. my purpose is just to render the incoming ui in current process. how can i make it? javascript import react, { component } from react ; import { platform, stylesheet, text, view } from react-native ; import rncallkit from react-native-callkit ; import uuid from uuid ; export default class app extends component<{}> { constructor props { super props ; rncallkit.setup { appname: call_kit } ; } onincomingcall { // store the generated uuid somewhere // you will need this when calling rncallkit.endcall let _uuid = uuid.v4 ; rncallkit.displayincomingcall _uuid, 886900000000 ; } render { return <view>{this.onincomingcall }</view>; } } thanks for any opinion.
