 URL : "https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-core/issues/89" TITLE : review impacted accounts BODY : _from @theoreticalbts on september 17, 2015 19:48_ as per the todo in impacted.cpp we need to review get_impacted_account_visitor cases here https://github.com/cryptonomex/graphene/blob/master/libraries/app/impacted.cpp which as of this writing https://github.com/cryptonomex/graphene/blob/b5db094b3b96f63e67729704f16e815807d7586e/libraries/app/impacted.cpp has many no-op cases. particularly suspicious:
- transfers express to but not from - it seems like these operations shouldn't be no-ops: limit_order_create_operation , call_order_update_operation , account_upgrade_operation , asset_create_operation , asset_fund_fee_pool_operation , asset_settle_operation , vesting_balance_withdraw_operation , worker_create_operation , balance_claim_operation also, it should be noted that i added the owner to impacted accounts for order cancellation in f0502ee2f15bdbcf81203f8859983817c23cd2cf since order cancellation ops can now be generated by the chain as virtual ops. _copied from original issue: cryptonomex/graphene 322_
