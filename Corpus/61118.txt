 URL : "https://github.com/martinjos/rb3_driver/issues/7" TITLE : adding multiple devices BODY : i have 2 keytars, and i want to uniquely patch them to separate outputs. unfortunately, the loop exits on first device. it should be relatively simple to add the option to select the input device if the search finds more than 1 device. that way, you can launch additional instances of rb3_driver and select the other devices for midi patching. i will make the change if you're busy xd. lmk
