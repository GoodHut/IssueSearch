BODY : <!-- thank you for reporting! --> <!-- please go to the forum first for support with crashes and issues. --> <!-- http://www.minecraftforge.net/forum/forum/18-support-bug-reports/ --> there aren't all that many config annotations at the moment and it would be really useful to have them, such as the sliders and buttons that cycle through arrays.
