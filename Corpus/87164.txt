BODY : here it says https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/04/02/how-to-create-your-own-templates-for-dotnet-new/ > after running install, to reset your templates back to the default list you can run the command dotnet new --debug:reinit. we donâ€™t currently have support for --uninstall, but we are working on that. but i cant find any issue that is tracking that change.
