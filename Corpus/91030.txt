 URL : "https://github.com/USGS-R/meddle/issues/36" TITLE : support multiple entities BODY : i have a zip file with several files inside, and i want to declare each file as a separate entity with its own list of attributes. i'm not sure how to do this and think i may need additional support to do it through meddle . i see only one <eainfo> section in the fgcd template, so one necessary step is to make that section repeating. in my own code, i tried to modify an attr.file to have a preliminary column called entity , then move toward adding additional entities to that table. but subsequent calls to attribute_skeleton gave warning messages: 1: in <-.data.frame tmp , j, , value = list entity = input.tsv , : provided 7 variables to replace 6 variables where entity = input.tsv was that new 1st column that i added . we might prefer some other solution for multiple entities, but i thought putting all the entities together in a single table sounded like a good idea, and i'm finding that it won't be possible without changes to meddle .
