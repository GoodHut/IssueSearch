 URL : "https://github.com/BankoP/Capstone_Colmar/issues/2" TITLE : simplify - flex display BODY : you did a great job using flex display in sections like 'middle' and the header section. be careful not to include the flex display where it is not needed. remember that block elements by default take a new line, so you don't need to specify a column flex-direction to get them to do that. one example of this is in middle-text, where you have three lines of text that are all naturally block elements and so would be on their own lines without using flex display. another example is on image-big which is just one img element and so adding flex display does not change anything about how it is aligned or appears on the page. always be striving for lean, concise, efficient code. make sure every line you add serves a purpose. adding extra styling can just make things more confusing and actually make your job harder as you work against some potentially unnecessary code later on.
