 URL : "https://github.com/duzun/hQuery.php/issues/26" TITLE : support for http proxies BODY : hi @duzun, great work on the library. are you open to adding support for http proxies to it? i've done a gist test php https://gist.github.com/nfreear/5fadc8c4e604486f0fec6c0f0f94be60 which demos what's involved currently without proxy authentication . alternatively, is there a way to use hquery::fromfile with create_stream_context ? i'll investigate, and update this ticket ; . thanks, nick
