 URL : "https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus/issues/1735" TITLE : git clone with terminus BODY : i am doing some continuous integration using pantheon repo. and i have a problem with cloning pantheon's site repo. i used terminus to log in with auth:login with a machine-token. i guess i do not need another layer of authentication to make a git clone command. i searched through terminus's commands and didn't find something that will do that. the only command that uses git, that i found, is env:commit , but i can't commit if i don't have the codebase or the git history.
