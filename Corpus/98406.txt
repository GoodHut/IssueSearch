 URL : "https://github.com/KristofferC/PGFPlotsX.jl/issues/16" TITLE : introduce new kwarg legend BODY : in accordance with this post https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/198997/pgfplots-two-y-axis-with-three-plots-and-one-legend i needed to \label a few addplot s. to maintain compatibility with plots , i imagine, pgfplotsx allows to define a \addlegendentry using a label= kwarg in constructing plot -like objects. however, i recommend that that kwarg be changed to legend and the additional kwarg of label be introduced, to help people like me. i have submitted 15 for this reason.
