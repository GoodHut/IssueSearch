 URL : "https://github.com/zmxv/react-native-sound/issues/228" TITLE : getduration not working BODY : i am trying to use getduration to determine when the user is at the end of their playback, but it is returning incorrect values. for example i have a 7 minute 12 second recording for which it should be returning something in the vicinity of 432 seconds, but it is currently returning approximately 410.5. this is on ios, have not tested on android.
