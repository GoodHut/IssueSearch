 URL : "https://github.com/zencashio/zen/issues/21" TITLE : minimize data leakage BODY : i'm opening up this issue to track data leakage issues with zen. i think when the network is complete it should be very difficult to identify zen users who don't wish to be identified. here are a few ways currently to identify zen users: 1. dns lookups. how can we use a cdn and domain fronting to overcome this issue? 2. tls handshakes put hostnames in the clear and iocs are able to be generated from this traffic 3. currently tls handshakes only validate servers; there should be an additional implementation to limit non-trusted clients from connecting
