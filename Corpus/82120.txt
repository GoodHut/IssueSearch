 URL : "https://github.com/clearlinux/swupd-client/issues/317" TITLE : add ghosted file handling BODY : when a file is ghosted in the manifest it should be treated as deleted for rename purposes, but swupd should not actually delete the file. this functionality allows renames to occur on files that are garbage collected by other processes i.e. kernels managed by clr-boot-manager while not actually deleting those ghosted files.
