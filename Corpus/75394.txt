BODY : so, now that you can specify a locale and get a comma or whatever added for longer numbers... is there no way to just turn that off? i'd simply like to have the numbers printed as-is without any separator at all. the default monetary= is blank -- but that still adds commas. can we have a way to specify that we don't want any such character added to the numbers? also, i'm confused how dec_places is used. it doesn't appear to have any effect when i change it. what is it supposed to be? thanks!
