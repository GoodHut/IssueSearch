 URL : "https://github.com/drone/drone-cli/issues/62" TITLE : change release process BODY : i would like to propose we decouple the cli release process and versioning from the core drone project. these projects move at different paces and coupling them together seems to be holding this project back. i was thinking maybe we handle this in a similar way to docker which provides a version number for the client and version number of the api that it supports: nohighlight $ docker version client: version: 17.06.1-ce-rc1 api version: 1.30 go version: go1.8.3 git commit: 77b4dce built: fri jul 14 07:38:15 2017 os/arch: darwin/amd64 server: version: 17.06.1-ce-rc1 api version: 1.30 minimum version 1.12 go version: go1.8.3 git commit: 77b4dce built: fri jul 14 07:33:35 2017 os/arch: linux/amd64 experimental: true we could do something similar with drone: nohighlight $ drone version client: version: 1.0.0 server: version: 0.8.0 minimum version 0.6 this is just an idea. i'm open to thoughts and alternate approaches here.
