BODY : hi. when scraping my mame folder on mame mode -mame it seems scraper is not using the adb database searching by filename . insted it gives me lots of hash not found and the ones that found it says thegamesdb on the gamelist.xml so it seems it's not using adb at all. can you please tell me if i'm doing something wrong because i can't figure it out why is searching by hash and on thegamesdb instead of filename on adb.arcadeitalia.net. this is the command i'm using scraper.exe -mame -workers 4 nothing else! thanks
