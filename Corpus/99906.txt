 URL : "https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues/1980" TITLE : non-x/y coordinate systems BODY : for sf, we want aes geometry = geometry , but currently there's no way for the coordinate system to get this information and generate the x and y positions from it. to fix this, i think, the generation of x and y scales needs to be made primarily the responsibility of the coordinate system: we need to call coord$train once for each layer with the full data, and allow it to generate the x and y scales however it likes. other coordinate systems this would facilitate: graph layout as coordinate system product plots projections from higher dimensions
