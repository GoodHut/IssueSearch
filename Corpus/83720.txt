 URL : "https://github.com/anno4j/anno4j/issues/128" TITLE : class equivalency in rdfs BODY : the specification of rdfs validity allows the definition of cyclic rdfs:subclassof relationships see rdf issue rdfs-no-cycles-in-subclassof https://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/ rdfs-no-cycles-in-subclassof . this constructs implies that the participating classes are to be considered equivalent. for generating java classes from an rdfs ontology the strongly connected components scc https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strongly_connected_component of the inheritance forest must be detected. the sccs are subgraphs in which every node is reachable from every other node and can be considered as equivalence classes in the above equivalence relation. ! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:graph_condensation.svg https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/graph_condensation.svg/774px-graph_condensation.svg.png example of sccs in a graph all subclass and domain/range definitions concerning the classes in a scc must be merged into a single class, for which a java class is generated later.
