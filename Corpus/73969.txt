 URL : "https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaplayer/issues/329" TITLE : dns failure with dnsmasq BODY : @metricmike commented on thu apr 27 2017 https://github.com/tiliado/tiliado-repositories/issues/21 running the spotify app gives me error resolving 'play.spotify.com': temporary failure in name resolution and a dialog error titled integration error with failed to inject javascript api. function 'nuvola.core.emit' failed. file:///app/share/nuvolaplayer3/web_apps/spotify/integrate.js:99: securityerror: the operation is insecure. the application might not function properly. the two changes i made which i think led to this were installing dnsmasq directs .dev to 127.0.0.1 and disabling dnsstublistener on systemd-resovlerd. i believe this has the consequence of forcing dns lookups through dnsmasq, but i'm not 100%. using the official spotify client or the web player through chrome work fine. any ideas? --- flatpak list eu.tiliado.nuvola/x86_64/stable system,current eu.tiliado.nuvolaappspotify/x86_64/stable system,current org.gnome.platform.locale/x86_64/3.22 system,runtime org.gnome.platform/x86_64/3.22 system,runtime flatpak info eu.tiliado.nuvolaappspotify app/eu.tiliado.nuvolaappspotify/x86_64/stable nuvola c91cf23a8d3beffdf30f43fb333c7b6c7f20ef234395ac8d1a7edb1154a5945c 223.0 mb lsb_release -a no lsb modules are available. distributor id:	ubuntu description:	ubuntu 17.04 release:	17.04 codename:	zesty uname -r 4.10.0-20-generic
