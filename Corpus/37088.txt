 URL : "https://github.com/ku-nlp/jumanpp/issues/8" TITLE : juman++ v2 todo list BODY : juman++ is being rewritten right now with the following goals: make analysis faster make it possible to use juman++ as a library no global mutable state well-defined thread safety make it possible to use juman++ with dictionaries/pos sets other than jumandic the development was done mostly in closed repository, but it is closing to the usable form, so i decided to open the development process. currently it is expected to have at least 6x analysis speed compared to the current version of juman++. the main objective is to have feature parity with the current version of juman++ dictionary format will not be compatible though . current code todo list - number unk handling - onomatopea unk handling - morph output format - training binary - model serialization logic - output correct jumandic pos ids - lattice output format
