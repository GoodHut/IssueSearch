 URL : "https://github.com/nextcloud/android/issues/1495" TITLE : no account sync BODY : hi! i have installed version 2.0.0rc5 of the client. as before, there is no automatic account sync of my files. i did not set up an automatic upload in the app, i only want to have my files synced. i marked them to be available offline. i have to trigger the sync manually. maybe you could add a sync interval like nextcloud newsreader or davdroid has.
