 URL : "https://github.com/victronenergy/venus/issues/155" TITLE : customer logo on overviews BODY : the logo on the boat & motorhome overview can have a custom image. the image is 208 x 118px and is currently located in /opt/victronenergy/themes/ccgx/images/mobile-builder-logo.png loading the image from the data partition to make an uploaded image survive an image update, it needs to be stored on the /data partition. proposed solution is to have the image plug-in always try to find the image recursively in all the subdirectories and uses the first found one. so the solution was: 1.	create a images/theme directory in /data partition lets say /data/theme/images 2.	create a symbolic link in /opt/victronenergy/themes/ccgx/images/ for example: 3.	/opt/victronenergy/themes/ccgx/images/images/ -> /data/theme/images 4.	copy the customer logo in /data/theme/images/mobile-builder-logo.png this way the logo will survive a firmware update and removing it will result on the default one being displayed. uploading the file a simple php or something like that page needs to be created and hosted in hiawatha that customers can use to upload the custom logo file.
