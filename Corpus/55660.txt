 URL : "https://github.com/projectcalico/k8s-policy/issues/95" TITLE : kubernetes egress rule BODY : while this is being discussed here: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/22469 i think it would be great if k8s-policy controller supports egress rules. example: - the isolation policy may contain a defaultdeny also for egress, as this is only a json that should be parsed by the policy-controller and inserted into the etcd from calico. - as the networkpolicy doesn't contain support for egress rules, we could use a third party resource for this one, or maybe some namespaces annotations. i think the first one is better, as we can migrate later and easily to the kubernetes network policy when this supports egress objects. also, this third party resource could support and cover some uncovered items from network policy, as the support to rules containing not only kubernetes objects, but also ip addresses. i don't know how to develop in python, but will try to make a poc to check how viable is this. tks
