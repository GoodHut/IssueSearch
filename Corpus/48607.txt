 URL : "https://github.com/textadventures/quest/issues/915" TITLE : setcss is not defined BODY : i didn't see anyone else that brought this up anywhere, and i spent a few days searching the web for the answer. so here is the situation: downloaded quest 5.7.1 downloaded questjs latest game exports, and compiles without issue. when the index.html file opens, you only see the menu bar at the top of the screen and the command bar. everything else is empty. when you use code inspector chrome or firefox , i see an error about setcss is not defined. when i go and look at the code in game.js it is always related to the new additions and changes to the interface. if you use a hex code for color, color name, don't use that feature at all, it is the same issue. how or what did i miss? note: i realize there is a new quest version being developed that includes functionality so that an export isn't needed. however, if this is an easy fix, it would allow people to use the latest questjs with quest 5.7.1, unless i'm the only one that has run across this.
