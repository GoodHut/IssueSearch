 URL : "https://github.com/tapglue/snaas/issues/37" TITLE : missing tls support BODY : in the overview docs page https://github.com/tapglue/snaas/wiki/overview ssl-only it is mentioned: > ssl only > > we require that all requests are done over ssl, thus all access is over https, and accessed from the api.tapglue.com domain. unencrypted http is not supported. and in the cmd/gateway-http/gateway-http.go file line 885 https://github.com/tapglue/snaas/blob/master/cmd/gateway-http/gateway-http.go l883 i see mentioned a comment saying // todo: handle tls. in the press release after the aquisition by localytics: - https://www.localytics.com/press/press_release/localytics-acquires-tapglue-to-help-enterprises-improve-mobile-engagement/ - https://medium.com/tapglue-stories/tapglue-got-acquired-by-boston-based-localytics-820c6fcde7c2 says that: > the tapglue platform will survive, although in a different form. we decided to not continue our managed service, but focus on the core localytics product initiatives. however, we made our powerful platform _completely_ available as an open source project  — probably the most comprehensive open-source project for building social features for apps. check out github to learn more about it. does this mismatch mean that the code in this github repository is not the same as the one used in production at api.tapglue.com ?
