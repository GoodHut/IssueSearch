 URL : "https://github.com/prasadtalasila/JavaAutolab/issues/66" TITLE : generation of new keys BODY : at present, the keys https://github.com/prasadtalasila/javaautolab/tree/dev/deploy/keys are static for all installations. they need to be generated afresh for each installation. during installtion, the freshly created keys need to be copied to the directories of main_server https://github.com/prasadtalasila/javaautolab/tree/dev/main_server/ssl , load_balancer https://github.com/prasadtalasila/javaautolab/tree/dev/load_balancer/ssl and execution nodes https://github.com/prasadtalasila/javaautolab/tree/dev/execution_nodes/ssl . the keys for execution nodes have to be generated into a separate directory called execution_nodes inside keys https://github.com/prasadtalasila/javaautolab/tree/dev/deploy/keys directory. once generated, these keys can be copied into execution nodes/ssl https://github.com/prasadtalasila/javaautolab/tree/dev/execution_nodes/ssl folder.
