 URL : "https://github.com/WayofTime/BloodMagic/issues/1074" TITLE : idea for tier 6 altar BODY : an idea for the tier 6 altar is to use will crystals instead of crystal cluster blocks. as another difficulty make it so we have to use one of each of the refined wills for the altar tiers, not only that, the crystals must be fully grown. this would be very grindy and difficult since each of the crystals is in a different chunk.
