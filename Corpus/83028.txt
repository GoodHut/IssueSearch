 URL : "https://github.com/tplgy/bonefish/issues/53" TITLE : bonefish websocket on tls BODY : on the front page of this repository/project, one reads that the daemon can be started as follows. > daemon/bonefish --realm default --websocket-port 9999 does the --websocket-port cover both tls and non-tls uses? how does one choose just one of them e.g, the tls one, and therefore forbid non-tls use ? is there any other command-line configuration option pertaining to tls?
