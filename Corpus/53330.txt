 URL : "https://github.com/kohsuke/github-api/issues/400" TITLE : do not throw new error BODY : https://github.com/kohsuke/github-api/search?utf8=%e2%9c%93&q=%22new+error%22&type= in general, this seems to be a bad idea. see also comments in https://github.com/jenkinsci/ghprb-plugin/pull/570. this pr for the ghprb plugin is left with the dilemma of catching throwable because there's no other choice since this api throws java.lang.error . a quote from java.lang.error javadoc: > an error is a subclass of throwable that indicates serious problems that a reasonable application should not try to catch.
