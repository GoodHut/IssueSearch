 URL : "https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/issues/167" TITLE : wrong travis-ci badge BODY : the travis-ci badge points to the wrong repository thealgorithms/python , which is itself not an active repository according to travis-ci. i also don't see a .travis.yml file in this repo so i guess there was some kind of mistake here.
