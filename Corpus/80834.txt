 URL : "https://github.com/jaketame/scripts/issues/3" TITLE : upload-cloud.sh cron job BODY : i currently have the cron statement in crontab -e: 30 2 /opt/plexacd/upload-cloud.sh in /var/log/cron.log, it shows that it runs the statement at 2:30am, but i don't think the actual script runs because when i check in the morning, /opt/plexacd/logs/rclone- .log's have nothing new, and my new media files are still on my local storage. any idea?
