 URL : "https://github.com/xSke/Pxls/issues/28" TITLE : unclear setup guide BODY : 1. reference config file does not contain all reference data oauth for example and some of it is unclear. it's better to provide commentaries in regards of what goes where. 2. prerequisites are not listed. maven and mysql server 3. installation guide just notes that you can configure app via conf file, but in reality you have to do it before you launch your app. recommendations: update readme with all prerequisites to installation. add a bit of commentary and/or examples to reference.conf file. update reference to latest requirements. here's the oauth section for reference: oauth { // it should point to server address + /auth , for example http://example.com/auth callbackbase: // to obtain key/secret for google oauth, go here: https://console.developers.google.com/ google { // google oauth service. you need to configure your callback url to callbackbase + /google , for example http://example.com/auth/google . key: secret: } // readme for reddit oauth: https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/oauth2 reddit { // same as google service, callbackbase + /reddit : http://example.com/auth/reddit key: secret: } twitter { // twitter auth disabled by default. same rules on callback url. key: secret: } }
