 URL : "https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/4530" TITLE : jest ignoring .babelrc BODY : i want to report a potential bug. currently, when running jest, i am getting an error: syntaxerror: unexpected token import . with my v20.0.4 branch this works just fine. with v21.1.0 the error occurs. my .babelrc has a test env: test : { plugins : transform-decorators-legacy , typecheck , presets : react , es2015 , stage-0 }, it would appear there has been a regression. i am running macos sierra, with yarn version 1.0.2. i can switch back and forth between jest versions and reproduce without modifying my .babelrc.
