 URL : "https://github.com/coderanger/kitchen-kubernetes/issues/5" TITLE : ssh agent forwarding BODY : some of my cookbooks need to forward ssh agent in order to be converged. but it looks like kubernetes doesn't support ssh agent forwarding. i know docker can do this using the command: docker run --volume $ssh_auth_sock:/ssh-agent --env ssh_auth_sock=/ssh-agent ubuntu ssh-add -l is there a way to forward ssh agent to a running or create a new one pod?
