 URL : "https://github.com/jncornett/gourd/issues/1" TITLE : finish the parser BODY : in particular: - finally block needs to be parsed. - parse errors should include location file-line-column information. - what constitutes a valid program needs to be evaluated. right now, there are no invalid programs, the parser just stops parsing at the first invalid token. this is problematic because there are no errors! - the parser and lexer tests need to be fleshed out.
