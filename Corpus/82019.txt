 URL : "https://github.com/mabreuortega/Cake.Tfs/issues/1" TITLE : add cake addin to website BODY : great work on getting this addin created! this is just a suggestion, but think it would be a really good idea, to help with visibility of this addin. i.e. get your addin listed here: http://cakebuild.net/addins have a look at this pr: cake-build/website 290 this assumes that you have added xml documentation to your addin, as described here: http://cakebuild.net/docs/contributing/documentation let me know if you have any questions. thanks!
