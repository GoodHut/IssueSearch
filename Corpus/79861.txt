 URL : "https://github.com/NamelessMC/Nameless/issues/865" TITLE : suggestion avatar frames BODY : what kind of issue is it question, bug, etc. ? suggestion in which version of namelessmc did it occur 1.x.x ? 1.0.20? how would you describe the issue? my suggestion is the possibility of giving avatar frames to donators,admins and etc that would be an great feature especially for vips, so they could be identified easily. even thought the vip group thing already makes it easier, why not even easier?
