 URL : "https://github.com/Bitz/OwO_Bot/issues/15" TITLE : ensure email uniqueness BODY : https://github.com/bitz/owo_bot/blob/74191b4d71b5e5cec20e08ae200a216c7718d084/owo_bot/functions/get.cs l193 and https://github.com/bitz/owo_bot/blob/74191b4d71b5e5cec20e08ae200a216c7718d084/owo_bot/functions/get.cs l191 put maybe a guid in the title so if the bot requests the same title twice, it would not get lumped in my inbox and get bugged out, giving one an empty title.
