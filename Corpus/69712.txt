 URL : "https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow/issues/486" TITLE : train the last n layers BODY : i want to choose how many layers i train. as far as i understand any layer that is edited in a .cfg will cause those layers to be randomly initialised but all the others will be loaded from the .weights and then the whole net will be fine tuned. what i want to do is to be able to choose that i want to freeze a couple of layers and fine tune only a few or randomly initialise a few. if this functionality exists please tell me how to use it else point me to the code where i can add this?
