 URL : "https://github.com/fbiville/neo4j-sproc-compiler/issues/45" TITLE : fix package name collision BODY : until 44 is solved, the only possible generation strategy is as follows: one file per package is generated. however, the filename corresponds to the simple package name and not its fully qualified name. this obviously causes problems if different packages share the same simple name.
