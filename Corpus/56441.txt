 URL : "https://github.com/YetiTech-Studios/UE4GameLiftClientSDK/issues/2" TITLE : need to add a license? BODY : hi there, came across this plugin, and seems like a great starting point for gamelift integration : one thing that might be good though is to add a license file or mention the license in the readme , since if no license is explicitly specified then someone isn't technically allowed to include your code in their project since you have the copyright by default . were you treating this as something people can freely use, eg. mit license? thanks!
