 URL : "https://github.com/learn-co-students/react-container-components-lab-v-000/issues/54" TITLE : solution does not compile BODY : i got all my tests passing, but was not able to get the project to compile and render in the browser. i finally cloned the solution and it has the same problem. i expect it might be related to the following warning that i received when i ran npm install : warn extract-text-webpack-plugin@2.1.2 requires a peer of webpack@^2.2.0 but none was installed.
