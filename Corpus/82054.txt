 URL : "https://github.com/Tarnadas/net64plus/issues/9" TITLE : add course name indicator BODY : hello, i wasn't sure if this would be an interesting feature/enhancement to net64plus, but i think it would be useful. i used cheat engine to find what i believe to be the memory location for where a player is in in-game. memory address from cheat engine : 0x50b2bac4 this appears to hold the course of the player. i went through the levels and collected their numbers: 00 - main castle/courtyard/outside 01 - bob bob-omb battlefield 02 - wf whomp's fortress 03 - jrb jolly roger bay 04 - ccm cool, cool mountain 05 - bbh boo's big haunt 06 - hmc hazy maze cave 07 - lll lethal lava land 08 - ssl shifting sand lang 09 - ddd dire, dire docks 10 - sl snowman's land 11 - wdw wet-dry world 12 - ttm tall, tall mountain 13 - thi tiny huge island 14 - ttc tick-tock clock 15 - rr rainbow ride 16 - bitdw bowser in the dark world 17 - bitfs bowser in the fire sea 18 - bits bowser in the sky 19 - pss peach's secret slide 20 - mc metal cap 21 - wc wing cap 22 - vc vanish cap 23 - otr wing mario over the rainbow 24 - sa secret aquarium what would be cool is to put the acronyms for the courses to the left of the player character in the player list: course acronym player character icon player name have any thoughts? thanks!
