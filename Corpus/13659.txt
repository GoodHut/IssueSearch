BODY : currently wire does everything i need, and does it well. i'd like to replace hangouts on my phone with it for everything, but it's missing sms, which is a crucial feature for me. implementation of sms or rcs would make this a gold standard in a chat app as far as i'm concerned, there would be no competition. 92 way back when addressed this, and was a great writeup, but was closed. is it really necessary to close the issue, and not leave it open as a possibility? i repost this now because its been 7 months, and the app is pretty rock-solid now.
