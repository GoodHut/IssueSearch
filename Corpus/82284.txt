 URL : "https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-plugin/issues/1658" TITLE : add remove account button BODY : i'm pretty much figured out how to add such button with all necessary hooks. i would add a button in account-list-item.js view, then add action on the ui that would dispatch to background and then need to figure out how to properly destoy the item. my question is: which branch should i use? is there something similar going on in development?
