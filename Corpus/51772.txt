 URL : "https://github.com/eclipse/tm4e/issues/92" TITLE : big memory consumption BODY : i'm playing with tm4e php editor and i noticed that opening php file can consume enormous amounts of memory. a single file can bump heap size from 200mb to 1100mb. used memory can be cleaned up by gc but maybe there is a way to optimize this somehow. tested file isn't small 1,7k but its also nothing very unusual. i had only a moment to check source code and after profiling it looks that lots of memory are used by onigregexp and compiling regular expressions. file for testing: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/composer/composer/master/src/composer/installer.php
