 URL : "https://github.com/ralesi/ahk-mode/issues/20" TITLE : license of the package BODY : hi, could not find any other contact info so opening an issue for this license request. in a thread in the emacs-devel maillist, the licensing situation for emacs packages provided through emacs package archives has been under focus. i have volunteered to contact the authors of packages that have a license that is incompatible with emacs, which is now under gpl-3+. see https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2017-07/msg01069.html so i wonder if you could consider to change the license of your package to gpl-3+?
