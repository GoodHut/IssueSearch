 URL : "https://github.com/Codeminer42/cm42-central/issues/99" TITLE : cross project milestones BODY : one way to scale projects is to have different teams working on separated projects to maintain focus and efficiency. but it's difficult for projects to coordinate because you would have to get in and out of different boards to see how they're doing. instead we could show all the related projects' milestones in all the boards. we should create a new portfolio entity. so: team has many portfolios portfolio has many projects portfolio_projects many-to-many table, no need for explicit model here then the storycollection must be able to fetch the stories of it's project + the milestone stories from the related projects to render in the same board possibly with a different color, tag, icon or something to clearly illustrate where that milestone came from . so each project can control their own stories and the other projects can immediate visualize if they will be able to deliver their stories until the global milestone. milestones have static dates, so they should appear in the same position in all the backlogs. we could add a field to the stories table, so if it is a milestone and if it has the global flag, all projects must show them. in the view the global milestone must show the project name to differentiate from local milestones.
