BODY : is there an option in mrgsolve similar to $mix in nonmem, with the goal of simulating from different populations? my current workaround is simply to run two separate simulations with the number of individuals based on the probability of being in population 1 vs 2 and then merging them into a single dataframe. this works, but if the option exists i would like to do this within the mrgsolve model. thanks jason
