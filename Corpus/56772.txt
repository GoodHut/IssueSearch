 URL : "https://github.com/xiangzhou/GEMMA/issues/55" TITLE : odd sized kinship file BODY : when running the new test testcenteredrelatednessmatrixk i get different resulting files on two build setups. one is the correct size, but the second has 1940 rows instead of 1410. the extra rows are the same as the tail of the previous - so, somehow, the output buffer gets overwritten. i'll scrutinize this more closely.
