 URL : "https://github.com/elastic/logstash/issues/8124" TITLE : dry .lock handling in dlq BODY : i realized that the dlq code in https://github.com/elastic/logstash/blob/d1aa2864c667d00cb6b2d3780d50f4a8360226da/logstash-core/src/main/java/org/logstash/filelockfactory.java is using its own logic to handle the exclusive locking. it should probably be better to reuse the existing filelockfactory https://github.com/elastic/logstash/blob/d1aa2864c667d00cb6b2d3780d50f4a8360226da/logstash-core/src/main/java/org/logstash/filelockfactory.java /cc @robbavey
