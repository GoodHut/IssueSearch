 URL : "https://github.com/edf-hpc/slurm-web/issues/175" TITLE : 3d view missing js files. BODY : this is an install onto rhel 7.3 from source git clone . when loading the 3d view, i get java script errors that: /slurm/js/modules/3d-view/ajax-utils.js /slurm/js/modules/3d-view/error-utils.js are missing. i solved the problem by linking dashboard/js/utils/ajax.js and dashboard/js/utils/error.js into the 3d-view directory as ajax.utils.js and error-utils.js respectively: $ pwd /usr/share/slurm-web/dashboard/js/modules/3d-view $ ln ../../utils/ajax.js ajax-utils.js $ ln ../../utils/error.js error-utils.js i am not sure if this was the correct way or not but it worked and the 3d view works. i reviewed the debian package setup files from git and didn't see anything about debian's packager creating links or doing special copies of those files, so i suspect this might be a bug and the 3d view java script needs to be updated to read /slurm/js/utils for those two files.
