 URL : "https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/issues/265" TITLE : pwndbg new ideas BODY : i know there is lot of work to do, but i like to share a couple of new ideas and get your feedbacks @zachriggle @disconnect3d @anthraxx. 1 in my opinion it will be useful if the command hexdump behaves like the classic gdb command x/200bx . i mean that when we type hexdump 0x804e000 200 we display 200bytes from the address specified basically until 0x804e200 , but then when i press enter in the cli i want to display 200bytes from 0x804e200 until 0x804e400. i think this is useful during debugging since i don't have to rewrite manually the address if i need more bytes it's faster to press enter! . 2 why not implementing a pseudo-scripting engine for pwndbg? user can have inside a text file a list of gdb or pwndbg commands and by typing something like pwnscript <scriptname> pwndbg will execute the specified commands. this should resemble something like the scripting engine of immunity that i found very very useful. do you think are they worth being implemented? any feedback?
