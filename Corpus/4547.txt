 URL : "https://github.com/aarzilli/nucular/issues/11" TITLE : docs on split? BODY : this library looks great, but i cant figure out how to make anything more complicated than the examples. how would i put the calculator demo inside one of the split panel demos? i tried calling it in place of the last grouporblock calls but ended up with ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2247982/29563196-dab4bc0a-877f-11e7-9530-96378d13eae3.png and if i replace any of the earlier ones i get a panic: command not available with current layout i know i'm must be misunderstanding the fundamental layout model, but i cant find any docs or examples.
