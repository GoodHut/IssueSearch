 URL : "https://github.com/bwssytems/ha-bridge/issues/488" TITLE : bulk add not working? BODY : i seem to remember in an early version being able to use the bulk add feature and the checkboxes to simply add several vera devices at once. in 4.1.4, when i do this, it seems like the dvices i check are combined into one, with the mapid being a composite of the two devices i added. eg. 102-345 is this the new desired behavior? i've recently switched from the docker version that self-upgraded to a raspberry pi and am starting my configuration from scratch and that seems to be my only issue. very time-consuming to add devices one by one with the interface refreshing each time.
