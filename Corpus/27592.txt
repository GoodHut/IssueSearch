 URL : "https://github.com/sdaigle2/pdi-database/issues/4" TITLE : do not rename files BODY : if we are using github to manage version history, don't rename the files. in the past you have named the files: pdi operations database_fe <date>.accdb. that is only necessary if we are not using a version manager like this github. from now on, there should only be 3 files in github: 1. readme.md 2. pdi operations database_fe.accdb 3. pdi operations database_be-dev.accdb
