 URL : "https://github.com/golang/go/issues/22833" TITLE : cmd/go: scope of -gcflags BODY : i see from the draft that: > the go build -asmflags, -gcflags, -gccgoflags, and -ldflags options now apply by default only to the packages listed directly on the command line i missed when this changed happened but i liked it a lot more when -gcflags applied to all packages that contributed to the executable. i was hoping delve could drop the -a command line option with 1.10 and take advantage of caching but with this behavior i don't think we can. cc @derekparker @heschik @hyangah
