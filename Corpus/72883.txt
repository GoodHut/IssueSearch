 URL : "https://github.com/HedgehogDevelopment/tds-codegen/issues/8" TITLE : children on sitecoreitem BODY : hi, i want to be able to use your tds project and a t4 template approach to create a class file for dictionary items. at the moment i have used the itempaths.tt as an example and have built a pretty good static class implementation - which just pick ups dictionary entries and folders. in order to create a more conventional non-static repo/class i need to get a list of child items on a sitecoreitem. for my purposes i only need to go one level down. is this something i can do at the moment, and if not would it be possible to add it as a collection or extension method? thanks, james.
