 URL : "https://github.com/TrackableEntities/trackable-entities-js/issues/2" TITLE : build changed entities BODY : _from @tonysneed on september 10, 2017 13:22_ - when an entity is updated, add a copy to a changedentities field of type trackableset or trackablemap . + an entity has a reference to its change set, so it can update the change when needed. + when an entity reverts to an unchanged state, the copy is removed from changedentities . _copied from original issue: trackableentities/trackable-entities-js-poc 8_
