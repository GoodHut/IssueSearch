 URL : "https://github.com/winder/Universal-G-Code-Sender/issues/840" TITLE : external pause button BODY : i'm using grbl's external pause button a physical button wired to the board that i press when something goes wrong. next i can usually press the resume button and the g-code goes on. it all worked fine for classic gui. i've tried the nightly build version 2.0, dec 03/2017 . the pause button sure stopped the program, but when i pressed the resume button, it turned out that the program skipped the remaining part of current line and immediately skipped to next line. instead it should first finish the current move.
