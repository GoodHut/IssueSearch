 URL : "https://github.com/akabe/ocaml-jupyter/issues/52" TITLE : fail to install with opam BODY : apparently, the installation script tries to install the kernel to /usr/share/jupyter/kernels/ , which would require root rights, but i am unable to either launch opam install jupter with the good options or with sudo . the error is: bash errno 13 permission denied: '/usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels/ocaml-jupyter-4.04.2' perhaps you want to install with sudo or --user ? e: failure command './kernelspec.sh install true /home/lilian/.opam/4.04.2/share/ocaml-jupyter' terminated with error code 1 i tried to manually hack the kernelspec.sh script to force using sudo jupyter ... and reinstalling from local archive manually modified , but this is not working. any insights? any easy way of fixing that? thanks! ps: it could help to also provide instructions on how to compile and install from the git repository.
