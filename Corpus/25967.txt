 URL : "https://github.com/yurtaev/idea-one-dark-theme/issues/14" TITLE : add missing license BODY : this looks like a cool project. however, this project is missing a license file which is necessary for others to build upon this repo. a contributor can easily license this repo through the github web interface by creating a file named license then selecting a template license from the menu that appears to the left. i highly recommend the ‘mit license’, the ‘bsd 2-clause license’, the ‘bsd 3-clause license’, the ‘isc license’, the ‘apache 2.0 license’, or another “permissive” license. i highly recommend against “copyleft” licenses, such as the gnu gpl, since they do not reflect the true spirit of open source software and since such licenses are harmful to commercial software projects that would like to include the licensed work. so, to foster the integration of this code into other projects, i recommend the mit license be given to this work. also, in addition, if this project used code from atom/one-dark-syntax, then this repo must reproduce its license as it is required per the terms of using the code.
