 URL : "https://github.com/exercism/xpython/issues/480" TITLE : add example test to readme BODY : currently, readme files have a description of the exercise and goals, but refrain from mentioning implementation details however, the test suite does require a specific format for inputs and outputs, particularly for handling invalid results some check for a raised exception, others will accept an empty string . including one of the tests in the readme would give a programmer all of the information they need to proceed in one place.
