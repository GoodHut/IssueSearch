 URL : "https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/issues/255" TITLE : mqtt topics are hardcoded BODY : hello, i really like the sonoff-tasmota projekt and do appreciate your work very much. but there is one issue i came across: i use sub_prefix, pub_prefix and pub_prefix2 values that differ from the default ones. but because they are not configurable i have to change them manually with every new release and compile the firmware myself before uploading it to my devices. i would really like the mqtt topics to be configurable through the web interface and to survive firmware firmware updates. this would be nice to have not only for the three topic-substrings listed above but for any mqtt topics used by the firmware. thanks a lot in advance!
