 URL : "https://github.com/nskins/goby/issues/113" TITLE : less verbose class couple BODY : currently, couple.new a, b is too tedious to write out every time. something nice might be like this: a, b . i know that array s and hash es can be represented in short form: and { }, respectively. maybe we could implement something similar for couple ? we should replace every instance in the codebase with the new notation.
