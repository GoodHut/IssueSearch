 URL : "https://github.com/sneas/ionic-native-http-connection-backend/issues/1" TITLE : put and delete working? BODY : skimming your code i saw that put and delete methods are supposed to work with the native backend. is that true? looking at https://github.com/wymsee/cordova-http/blob/master/src/ios/cordovahttpplugin.h and https://github.com/wymsee/cordova-http/issues/111 i get the impression they don't. would be nice if they work!
