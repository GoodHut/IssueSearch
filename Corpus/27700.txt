 URL : "https://github.com/SpongePowered/Ore/issues/241" TITLE : dumb security audit BODY : have you ever heard of those professional security audits which cost a lot of money ? perfect, forget about the professional part and here you go: a dumb security audit. - we should add all the fancy secure headers; - x-frame-options - x-xss-protection - x-content-type-options - currently ore set three cookies i don't think i missed something : play_session, _stat and _warning. all of them are set without the secure flag - no cache control header is used we should use no-cache, no-store, etc. i'm talking about the page, it's not relevant if we cache certain images like avatar or such - like the home soon , ore should use a csp: something like this: content-security-policy: default-src 'none'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self' https://auth.spongepowered.org/ https://forums-cdn.spongepowered.org/ https://www.gravatar.com/ https://www.spongepowered.org/; font-src https://fonts.googleapis.com/; connect-src 'self'; form-action 'self'; upgrade-insecure-requests; block-all-mixed-content; nb: do not use this, this is just a draft. it should be fixed, for example it doesn't allow img to be loaded in the plugin page people use imgur or such to upload their images ok, i didn't have much time to test extensively and most problems were found with auth.spongepowered.org so maybe i should open an issue there. also, i got an sql error while playing with &token= in the download page, is it checked for invalid character ? i also found some minor things, not really issues, like this https://ore.spongeproject.net/?page=2147483648 i'm not sure i have finished, i will update this tomorrow
