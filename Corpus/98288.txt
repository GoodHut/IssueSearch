 URL : "https://github.com/zendframework/zend-i18n/issues/64" TITLE : ini file format won't work BODY : pl_pl.ini file: application abc = translator works config: 'translator' => array 'locale' => 'pl_pl', 'translation_file_patterns' => array array 'type' => 'ini', 'base_dir' => 'data/lang', 'pattern' => '%s.ini', , , , usage: view <?= $this->translate 'abc' ?> error: each ini row must be an array with message and translation contents of $list var from zend\i18n\translator\loader\ini.php line: 51 array application => array abc => translator works my main question is: why the heck does the ini.php class expects format of 2 values in array like: array 'key', 'value' , where as the correct format is returned by inireader like array key => value ?? either inireader should output correct format or ini.php should cope with that format. anyway the fix which i am curretly using is to put the following two lines inside foreach loop like so: foreach $list as $message { $message = key $message ; $message = array_reverse $message ; this would ensure that proper inireader output is reformated to proper acceptable format of ini.php class. please tell me that i am doing something wrong with setup of translator, cause i don't want to believe that zend company has released such untested and buggy vital part of framework to the public..
