 URL : "https://github.com/rafrex/spa-github-pages/issues/18" TITLE : can't find bundle.js BODY : hey there, i tried your solution but for some reason the index.html can't find the bundle.js. not sure if it's a path thing. i'm using the default domain of my repo my src path directs to /repo-name/build/bundle also copied the script and the 404 page and change the segmentcount to 1. locally everything works fine but the bundle served differently obviously.. any idea what might be missing ?
