 URL : "https://github.com/broadinstitute/keras-rcnn/issues/28" TITLE : r-cnn api design BODY : i think it is the time to think about how the r-cnn api should look like. we have discussed it a bit in broadinstitute/keras-rcnn 7, but there it is more about the structure than the api. from my understanding, a r-cnn framework should include a head, that predicts rois from images, and a couple of tails, that predicts scores, bounding boxes and masks . the idea is to easily attach different heads, resnet s , vgg, fpn etc., and choose to include/exclude the mask tail. do you have an elegant way of doing this in minds? @0x00b1 @jhung0
