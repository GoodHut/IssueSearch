 URL : "https://github.com/fuerbringer/wired-startpage/issues/4" TITLE : migrate to nosql mongodb BODY : this project makes a perfect candidate for nosql since pretty much the entire dataset is based on key-value pairs websitename + url . following steps have to be taken to convert the project from plain json files residing in /data required changes backend - gradually empty and remove the /data directory - translate the json files into a mongodb schema - adapt the model and controller classes to mongoose mongodb - expose the data as restful crud api frontend - allow new columns and entries to be created and deleted on hover and click - calls to the api should be made asynchronously - the view should be updated on the spot - optional angular might be suited for this use-case. why reading data from plain json files is not exactly ops friendly. furthermore it's just not convenient having to add a bookmark by editing a textfile just to add a bookmark.
