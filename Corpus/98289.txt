 URL : "https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/issues/1696" TITLE : ini: merging does not work BODY : description it seems like kdb merge does not work correctly if we use ini as default storage. steps to reproduce the problem 1. configure elektra with ini as default storage: sh mkdir build cd build cmake .. -gninja -dplugins='all' -dkdb_db_file='default.ini' -dkdb_db_init='elektra.ini' -dkdb_default_storage=ini 2. build elektra: sh ninja 3. run the following commands: sh kdb set user/tests/script/mergetest/ours/key init kdb set user/tests/script/mergetest/theirs/key init kdb set user/tests/script/mergetest/base/key init kdb merge \ user/tests/script/mergetest/ours \ user/tests/script/mergetest/theirs \ user/tests/script/mergetest/base \ user/tests/script/mergetest/merged expected result the tool kdb merge should produce a new key user/tests/script/mergetest/merged with the value init . describe what actually happened 1 conflicts were detected that could not be resolved automatically: user/tests/script/mergetest/merged/key ours: conflict_meta, theirs: conflict_meta merge unsuccessful. additional information - elektra version: master - jenkins build job: elektra-ini-mergerequests https://build.libelektra.org/jenkins/job/elektra-ini-mergerequests
