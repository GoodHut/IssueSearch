 URL : "https://github.com/leeoniya/domvm/issues/174" TITLE : rfc event handler changes BODY : while working on eliminating the event listener mem leak in 173, i had a thought. setting ._raw = true on event handlers to avoid domvm's wrapper is a bit awkward. what if events defined by a function were left entirely alone. so, onchange: myfn would only receive event . events that would receive the full argument list ...args, e, vnode, vm, data would be ones defined by array-wrapped functions: onchange: myfn . one implication of this would be that any vm-level and global onevent callbacks would only be triggered for wrapped event handlers, but not native/bare handlers. cc @lawrence-dol
