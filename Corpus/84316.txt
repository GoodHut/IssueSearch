 URL : "https://github.com/snowdd1/homebridge-knx/issues/74" TITLE : creating complex handlers BODY : hi, i'm trying to do the following task and i was wondering if it is possible to do that using a homebridge-knx plugin 1. a physical knx switch is sending some telegram to a virtual address group x/y/z . 2. a handler will listen to this address x/y/z and once it gets the call, it will send several telegrams to few group address not related to the characteristic that was used in the knx_config.json to register the handler i'm trying to use the handles framework in order to program the behavior of physical switches. so they can be used to perform complex scenes. if possible, could you please indicate what needs to be done handler / config to achieve this? thanks nd
