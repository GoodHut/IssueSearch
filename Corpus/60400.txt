 URL : "https://github.com/panavrin/live-writing-osc/issues/15" TITLE : /add text feedback loop BODY : here's one issue, sang, that would be worth looking at; but i can work around it. i send text from my app to lw on port 3333. next, lw mirrors this text entry and sends it back to my app on port 3334. for the moment, i think this is creating a bit of havoc in my max patch, which i can work around. in the future, i could imagine some interesting applications will multiple computers. however, in this case, how about either: disabling this mirrored/returned signal back to the app; or create an osc address for enabling/disabling this feedback feature e.g., /add/feedback 0 or 1 to disable or enable . does this make sense?
