 URL : "https://github.com/MISP/MISP-Taxii-Server/issues/11" TITLE : events with no attributes BODY : hi, i noticed that some events specifically from hailataxii are still producing events with empty attributes as the attributes is not formatted properly. i am sure that the feeds should normalized at the source but i thought that it's not a bad idea to do a check after the adding just incase. note: if yout think this is useful i can request pull. if len package.attributes > 0 : e = misp.add_event package._json_full print 'event ' + e 'event' 'id' + ' added to misp.' if e 'event' 'attribute_count' == '0': print 'event ' + e 'event' 'id' + ' deleted from misp - missing attributes...' misp.delete_event e 'event' 'id'
