 URL : "https://github.com/realfastvla/rfpipe/issues/14" TITLE : saving canddata object BODY : future interest likely for machine classification of candidates. the png is currently the only way the image and spectra are saved, but they are not great input to a machine classifier. saving canddata object may make it easier to add ml in the future. ideally we'd save canddata and generate plots from that. but not clear how to do that. more likely, we need to save both canddata and candcollection and pngs and associate offline.
