 URL : "https://github.com/cefsharp/cef-binary/issues/63" TITLE : appveyor: build on all prs BODY : we should look into changing this setting https://github.com/cefsharp/cef-binary/blob/master/appveyor.yml l9 , so that we build on all prs. this helps us verify changes in build.ps1 more easily. the easiest way to fix this from what i can tell would be to tweak this part https://github.com/cefsharp/cef-binary/blob/master/build.ps1 l49 to set the nuget package version like this $env:appveyor_build_version , unless $env:appveyor_repo_tag -eq true in other words, we will get junk version numbers like 62.0.0-ci34 _until_ we tag the repo; for these builds, we will set the nuget package version to match the tag just like we've done historically. anyone wants to fix this - feel free, it's up for grabs.
