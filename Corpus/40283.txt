 URL : "https://github.com/mike-fabian/ibus-typing-booster/issues/10" TITLE : too slow, not usable BODY : hi i read about this first in the f24 or f25 change log and tried it but forgot about it for some time. today i saw the article on fedora news and thought to give it a try again as i only had to switch layouts. sadly i have to say after 10 minutes i turned it off again. its soooooo slow it can't handle normal typing speed and in at least two apps it doesn't catch the space. have to hit it twice. tried with the tab option on. think when its turn off space is working but every thing is still slow. so nice thing but it needs to be much faster. not necessarily the suggestions but normal input shouldn't have any noticeable delay. for me i can consider the current state only alpha as it's not usable as an daily input method. but still pretty cool thing. and i don't know that much about python but i always thought of it as nice language but never considered it for things which needs to be lightning fast like i would expect from this. just my thought and feedback. maybe i just hit a bug. then i would be happy to see a fix and try it again.
