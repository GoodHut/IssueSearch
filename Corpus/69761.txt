 URL : "https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13334" TITLE : ts aircraft hover logic BODY : currently, the aircraft in ts change their altitude through a full stop and hover up/down cycle depending on the elevation of the next tile. this is causing animation glitches and really weird behaviors in hilly maps. instead of an on-the-spot hover up/down, i think a better method should be implemented like calculating an altitude curve which is easing depending on the target elevation and changes in between.
