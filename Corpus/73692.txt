 URL : "https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper/issues/2052" TITLE : datetime timezone issues BODY : after updating from a very old version, i noticed a change with datetime mapping. even with a datetime converter that changes the kind of datetime, something in automapper changes it to utc time. so for example, let's say i want the datetime to be specified as local time like this: public datetime convert datetime source, datetime destination, resolutioncontext context { destination = datetime.specifykind new datetime source.ticks , datetimekind.local ; return destination; } even with this, the dates come back converted to utc time. i cannot find a setting to stop it from doing this. i do not want automapper to modify datetimes.
