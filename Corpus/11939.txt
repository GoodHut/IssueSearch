 URL : "https://github.com/heroku/cli/issues/637" TITLE : make --app param BODY : hello, i am not sure that this is a right place but: please, make the app argument come before the command, like that: heroku -a appname command it is helpful because you can: 1. apply multiple commands to the same application without retyping the app each time. 2. ability to make an alias, like alias heroku_app= heroku -a appname please do that, it is so annoying...
