 URL : "https://github.com/pysal/pysal/issues/933" TITLE : edge id data structure BODY : in some parts of pysal.network edge ids are a tuple of node ids. however, in the simplified graph it's possible for multiple edges to share the same node pair. this gist https://gist.github.com/jgaboardi/a5a5649f3428bf9408d3f2c08a747eed shows two examples of this issue. it currently arises in the graph_lengths dictionary that uses node pairs as the dictionary key resulting in 150 edge lengths when there are actually 152 edges. this may be affecting other objects in pysal.network . - platform information: 'posix', 'darwin' 'darwin', 'wg-dhcp201d193d095.secure.wireless.fsu.edu', '16.5.0', 'darwin kernel version 16.5.0: fri mar 3 16:52:33 pst 2017; root:xnu-3789.51.2~3/release_x86_64', 'x86_64' - python version: 2.7.13 | packaged by conda-forge | default, mar 20 2017, 14:26:36 gcc 4.2.1 compatible apple llvm 6.1.0 clang-602.0.53 - scipy version: 0.19.0 - numpy version: 1.12.1
