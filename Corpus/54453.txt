 URL : "https://github.com/tomlepaine/fast-wavenet/issues/18" TITLE : generating novel audio BODY : ran your demo, and it worked fine. the generator can reproduce the training sample. now i want to generate some new sounds, e.g., by changing the initial conditions. i tried changing the input sample to the generator, but that didn't change anything---it still reproduces the training excerpt. any ideas? i'm wondering if the model has been overfit?
