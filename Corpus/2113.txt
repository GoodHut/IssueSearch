 URL : "https://github.com/KristofferC/JuAFEM.jl/issues/131" TITLE : stuff to fix BODY : umbrella issue to track things to tweak: - some way for a node to know it is on the boundary. useful for something like this: addnodeset! grid, all nodes on boundary , onboundary x - currently push! is used to add fields to a dofhandler, while for grid we have addnodeset / addcellset . should we have addfield! to be more consistent?
