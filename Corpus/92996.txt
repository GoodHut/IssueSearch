 URL : "https://github.com/bespoken/dashboard/issues/163" TITLE : add ability to link to log BODY : as of right now, you can link directly to a logs page like so: {host}/dashboard/skills/{sourceid}/logs it would be nice to look directly at a selected page via url with parameters. like: {host}/dashboard/skills/{sourceid}/logs&id={convoid} this would allow collaborators to exchange the url and go directly to it.
