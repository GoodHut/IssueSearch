 URL : "https://github.com/deajan/osync/issues/107" TITLE : double master setup BODY : is is possible to use osync in a master-master setup? where there are two hosts that can both add or remove file to/from a certain directory, and every time that occurs on one master, it syncs to the other master. i'm worried about the 600s delay and the file monitoring trigger which may cause an infinite loop.
