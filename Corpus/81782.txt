 URL : "https://github.com/holaymolay/carttools/issues/5" TITLE : 6000 ms might be too long BODY : the settimeout at the end of the script file is 6 seconds long. the reason its there is to give the api calls enough time to finish talking with yelp and push the response to an array. it may only need 3000. i am happy to consider a different approach, but i'm not what that would be.
