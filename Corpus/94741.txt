 URL : "https://github.com/sourcebots/plan/issues/33" TITLE : clarify upstream licensing BODY : some of our repos are forks of sr's repos and don't contain licenses. we were given the impression that it's fine to fork and use them, but it would be nice to have some legal clarity regarding this. sr are aware of this and it's on their list of things to do, though it's probably a good idea to poke them about it every once in a while. for reference, sr's intention is for all of their hardware designs to be licensed under cc by-nc-sa 4.0 or cc by-sa 4.0, and all software to be licensed under a gpl-compatible license mit, i think .
