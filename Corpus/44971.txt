 URL : "https://github.com/adevore/rudy/issues/16" TITLE : get working on stable BODY : currently there are three nightly features: - conservative_impl_trait: i planned on using this with iteration, but can switch to concrete types for now. - associated_consts: stabilized in 1.20, can be removed entirely. - slice_patterns: this was only used as a shortcut because i was already using nightly. the slices patterns can be replaced with more verbose code.
