 URL : "https://github.com/yoe/sreview/issues/34" TITLE : prettier user interface BODY : i got a little bit curious about what it would take to make the review interface prettier, not just cosmetics but making the interactions more intuitive. i quickly skimmed talk.html.ep https://github.com/yoe/sreview/blob/8dad2d197c97600ecfeec1b127ee21b274ab743e/web/templates/talk.html.ep but it wasn't immediately obvious what kind of requests need to be sent from the client side. i was wondering about the feasibility of being able to help with this without knowing any perl and being able to use javascript and html alone?
