 URL : "https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/7077" TITLE : upgrade to wxpython 4.0.0 BODY : hi, robin dunn announced on april 15th that wxpython phoenix will be known as wxpython 4, and an alpha was posted to pypi. in addition to providing an easier way for us to migrate to python 3.x, it modernizes wxpython code. python package index link: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wxpython/4.0.0a1 speaking of wxpython phoenix and nvda: i worked on porting nvda source code to phoenix last year under the project name of heliopolis . due to huge gui improvements introduced in nvda 2016.4, current heliopolis code based on 2016.2 will not work, so i'm porting from scratch. a few things to be aware of: system tray icon class now lives in wx.adv package. the six compatibility layer must be included. wx.spinctrlnamestr is no longer in use, so i replaced the relevant code with a string literal. wx.centeronscreen is unavailable. so far: copying wxpython 4 files to misc dependencies and compiling nvda works. initialization works. log viewer is working, although you may get an error that says, wx.yield called recursively . you cannot press enter after you type code in python console. when you exit a settings dialog and attempt to open another, nvda will say that another settings dialog is open, likely having to do with instance tracking. thanks.
