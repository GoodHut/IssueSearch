 URL : "https://github.com/mprzodala/react-components-form/issues/19" TITLE : onsubmit is called twice BODY : onsubmit handler passed as a prop to the form component is called twice. it's caused by this.submitform being passed to children via context, and then called here https://github.com/mprzodala/react-components-form/blob/master/src/components/fieldconnect.jsx l74 , apart from the submit handler https://github.com/mprzodala/react-components-form/blob/v2.1.0/src/components/form.jsx l122 in form class itself. it's related to changes in v2.1.0 . i can submit a pr to fix that, probably tomorrow.
