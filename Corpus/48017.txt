 URL : "https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/issues/2234" TITLE : reevaluate lock usage BODY : alamofire currently uses a few different locking solutions, including nslock and dispatchqueue.sync . we should use a single pattern, if possible, for these needs. i like the pthreadmutex / protector https://github.com/procedurekit/procedurekit/blob/81c6c6276aa198edf6a82b7dbabde2ae41e368c5/sources/procedurekit/support.swift l67 combo from procedurekit but other options can be evaluated.
