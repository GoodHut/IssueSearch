 URL : "https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate/issues/1677" TITLE : question on saga BODY : in this boilerplate, the generator githubdata defined here https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate/blob/master/app/containers/homepage/sagas.js l33-l42 is meant to listen for the action 'load_repos'. my question is should not we add an infinite loop to the generator so that after the loading completes, it can continue to listen to future action? what i mean is something like this taken from here https://shift.infinite.red/using-redux-saga-to-simplify-your-growing-react-native-codebase-2b8036f650de jsx function foreveralone { while true { yield take 'hi' yield put { type: 'wave' } } } i must be missing something here. thank you.
