 URL : "https://github.com/bogado/file-line/issues/73" TITLE : breaks swapchoice setting? BODY : not sure why this is happening, but i'm pretty sure this plugin breaks the v:swapchoice varaible. i have a section of code in my vimrc like: vim augroup nosimultaneousedits autocmd! autocmd swapexists let v:swapchoice = 'o' augroup end here's some online explanation https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-vim-script-5/index.html . it looks like vim and nvim no longer respect the swapchoice setting when this plugin is loaded. it works for 'q' and 'a' i didn't try others , but not 'o' probably the most common choice . any idea what's going on here?
