 URL : "https://github.com/malucooo/Otxserver-New/issues/504" TITLE : monsters - failure BODY : i notice that scorpion has his poison attack missing. i did noticed before that rotworm is giving 100 gps and probably has a lot more monsters with some issues. really dunno what happened, cause i spent a lot of time fixing all the monsters attacks, loots, xp/hp etc... and someone just re-uploaded the previously ones. really disappointed about that =\
