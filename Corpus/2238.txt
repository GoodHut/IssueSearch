 URL : "https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/1009" TITLE : v150 to v151 BODY : does a new update purposely prevent old versions from working? i have an opi one that was working ok on v150, for some reason i wasn't able to connect to it remotely by it's local ip address the last 2 days. i had to physically connect it to a monitor in order to update it so i could get pi-hole working and connect to it via local ip address again.
