 URL : "https://github.com/srophe/srophe-eXist-app/issues/949" TITLE : icon in browser tabs BODY : when i have a lot of tabs open as i move back and forth between person, place, and work records, it is super helpful that the gazetteer records have a gimel with maroon background. the person and work records currently have the alaph with blue background that is for the syriaca.org homepage. can you please make the icon that appears in the tab, the icon for the module not the volume of which that record is a part. thanks.
