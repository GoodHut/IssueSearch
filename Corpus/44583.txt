 URL : "https://github.com/perliedman/leaflet-realtime/issues/81" TITLE : feature style control BODY : hello, you changed the base type for l.realtime from l.geojson to l.layer. in the process, i lost the style property http://leafletjs.com/reference-1.2.0.html geojson-style . how can i now style and control the change of style of features? i use l.realtime to not only change positions geometries but also appearance style of features. it was working great, but broke when you change the base class of l.realtime. any suggestion for workaround? thanks.
