 URL : "https://github.com/w3c/manifest/issues/555" TITLE : icon shapes and masking BODY : i've been thinking about how vanilla android 7 has largely round icons or at least some new google-flavor android does and thus icons provided in the manifest, even with the platform property will look slightly strange on that os. i heard some developer complain recently that they're not sure how to get the circular shape. taking a broader view on this problem, samsung has their own icon mask shape, xiaomi have their own icon shape etc. thus i wonder if a better solution is to have sites provide their icon as a large square with sufficient padding around the edges and then have the browser apply a mask appropriate for the os it's running on. not sure how that could fit into the spec in terms of platform etc. perhaps we could just use platform: 'android_maskable' or something, but wanted to raise it as an idea.
