 URL : "https://github.com/keybase/client/issues/8543" TITLE : facebook page proof BODY : how does one prove themselves on a facebook page? not your personal profile, but a page you're an admin of? if i use the cli to generate the url i'm supposed to click, it directs to me to my personal profile and not my page. the payload is also not something i can copy/paste into my page so i'm not sure what the contents should look like. is there a way to have the cli output just the payload and not generate a url?
