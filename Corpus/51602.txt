 URL : "https://github.com/mcdermottsolutions/billtracker-flask/issues/6" TITLE : automate bill scraping BODY : - we probably want to automate the bill scraping with a cron job so it checks for new bills like once a week and adds new bills to the database. - this will be complicated by the fact that bills have many different phases and the bill number changes from house to senate, etc. we will need some strategies here.
