 URL : "https://github.com/darrenmoore/GoodIntentionsChatBot/issues/127" TITLE : thinking / reading time BODY : why maybe the user types multiple lines into the bot. the bot should have time to think. what add a config setting for reading time. if the same user sends multiple requests then it's added to the request stack for multiple intents. complicated as hell to do correctly. but will use the same logic as multiple intents on one request. so maybe it appends it to the queue. the queue could handle the reading time.
