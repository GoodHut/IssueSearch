 URL : "https://github.com/Zeex/pawn/issues/203" TITLE : main code stock warning. BODY : we could add a warning for when stock is used in any file not included from under -i directories. it would be nice, but i don't know if assuming that -i denotes only library includes is sufficient. though i suspect it should be - even nicely modular large modes don't use those for their composite parts.
