 URL : "https://github.com/mpetroff/pannellum/issues/401" TITLE : tour direction continuity BODY : hi, i'm building a tour with each area crosslinked by hotspots. currently the view reorients to yaw=0, pitch=0 on each scene load. i'd like to save the compass heading in order to restore that when the new scene loads. my intentions are to use the northoffset saved on the scene along with the yaw in order to calculate a compass heading. from the reference section it looks like scenechange should fire before the new scene loads but it seems to be giving me the values from the new scene, rather than the one i'm coming from. is that the way it should be operating? can you tell me if there's another event i should listen to instead?
