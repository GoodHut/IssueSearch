 URL : "https://github.com/philanc/plc/issues/7" TITLE : prefix all modules by plc BODY : currently, plc does not use a namespace. this is a proposal to move all lua files to the plc namespace, i.e. create a directory called plc and put them inside it, then write for instance require plc.md5 instead of require md5 . the goal of this is to solve conflicts with other packages which have the same name as one of the modules, md5 being a good example. it is also a prerequisite to package plc as a lua rock.
