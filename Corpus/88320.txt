 URL : "https://github.com/bryantran97/Grocery-Checklist/issues/1" TITLE : need to fix naming issues BODY : for the most part, the code is pretty clean, i just need to come back and fix it so that it's not a to-do type deal. i followed tutorials to create this site, original purpose was a to-do application, but i thought i'd try to be at least somewhat original and re-purpose it as a grocery list app . but only fix this when i have time, not a high priority.
