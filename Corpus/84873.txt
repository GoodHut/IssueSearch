 URL : "https://github.com/taniman/profit-trailer/issues/261" TITLE : don't buy brand new coins BODY : can there be something put in place to restrict the bot from not buying brand new coins? like the coin must be at least x days old to enable trading? for example: https://bittrex.com/market/index?marketname=btc-rcn this coin was a bloodletting on release day... and the bot bought on the first candle, which triggered it to dca itself into a rabbit hole.
