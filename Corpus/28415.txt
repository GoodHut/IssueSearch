 URL : "https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum/issues/769" TITLE : gas limit hardcoded BODY : the tester no longer takes a gas_limit parameter, t.chain gas_limit=number is something needed in order for augurproject's tests to run on the new pyethereum. it should make a header with the gas_limit as number and pass it to the genesis_helpers instead of just using none. relevant code below: https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum/blob/develop/ethereum/tools/tester.py l124 https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum/blob/fdfcf69a81a9fec159394db68099d6582201ad6d/ethereum/genesis_helpers.py l113 i'm happy to implement this + make a pr if it'll get approved
