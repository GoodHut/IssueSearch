 URL : "https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/issues/870" TITLE : question about node BODY : hi question about node packages. how is this analysed, and which option do you recommend? let me explain if i send as scanpath just package.json, seems like it analyses only first level dependencies. in my scenario, no vulnerabilities detected if i leave scanpath empty, it analyses all the dependencies in the project, and dependencies of the dependencies it is, all the package.json in my workspace , and then, vulnerabilities are reported having said that... what is the right way to scan a node project? i mean, if i have a dependency a, that uses a dependency b, that uses c, and c has a vulnerability, then, i understand that b has the same vulnerability as c, and also a has the same vulnerability, isnt it? thanks
