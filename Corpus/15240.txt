 URL : "https://github.com/Superbalist/laravel-google-cloud-storage/issues/13" TITLE : custom domain uri BODY : looks like i can only set a domain to go directly to a bucket. because of this, the ->url method will return https://domain.com/domain.com/file.ext. -- the second domain.com being the bucket. if i try to do domain.com/bucket_name/file.ext, i get permission denied even though the file is public. am i missing something?
