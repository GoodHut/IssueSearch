 URL : "https://github.com/zpnk/stage-ci/issues/39" TITLE : docker deployments fail BODY : originally raised here https://github.com/zpnk/stage-ci/issues/34 issuecomment-342667544 . the npm build script isn't being run in docker, it simply installs and then runs. https://github.com/zpnk/stage-ci/blob/408f6a02a09b642b85ab92797c5646eabf1a6a72/package.json l10 https://github.com/zpnk/stage-ci/blob/408f6a02a09b642b85ab92797c5646eabf1a6a72/dockerfile l7-l14 when now spins up a new deployment, it runs the build step automatically. i can see two ways to fix this: 1. update the dockerfile to include the build step 2. rename the build script to preinstall ✌️
