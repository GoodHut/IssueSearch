 URL : "https://github.com/rricharz/pi-top-battery-status/issues/16" TITLE : shutdown if battery low BODY : the rpi needs to be shut down gracefully if the battery level gets low. the lxde lxpanel battery module just gives a warning, but does not shut down. perhaps a script like unix.stackexchange.com/questions/84437 could do the job. the info is at sys/class/power_supply/sbs-1-000b
