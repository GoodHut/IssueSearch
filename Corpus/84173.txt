 URL : "https://github.com/PeterHorsbollMoller/mbLibrary/issues/3" TITLE : create a ribbonfactorylib BODY : create a new module that would use the ribbonlib but be some what easier to use. the absic idea here is that if the user creates a tab, the next action would use this tab. if the user creates a group, a new control would get added to this group. it should also be possible to set the current tab, group, spiltbutton etc. also consider single functions for adding a button. they should contain all information for the button, tooltip, image and handler
