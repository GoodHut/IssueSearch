BODY : hello, thanks for the best theme i've seen to date. i have a quick question, hopefully it can be answered as such. i would love to have the white theme with green accents highlighting, etc. . i know this is a lot to ask, therefore i have no problem doing it myself, but unfortunately i have never created/edited a theme before. a little guidance would be wonderful, thank you.
