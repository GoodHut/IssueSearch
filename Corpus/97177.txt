 URL : "https://github.com/vitmalina/w2ui/issues/1585" TITLE : format date from mysql/php BODY : i tried to display data from php/mysql using render. mysql dates are like yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm and i want to display in dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm i have w2utils.settings.datetimeformat: yyyy-mm-dd|hh:mi so for this, in columns i put: render: {datetime:dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm}. it doesn't work, and when editting the cell it converts again to yyyy-mm-dd hh_mm i can't change my display format dates on rendering, and can't also when editting a cell with date. when sending also i have an error. is this a bug or is there another way to do this?
