 URL : "https://github.com/siddharthkp/bundlesize/issues/32" TITLE : threshold null gzip error BODY : i've noticed that the docs use maxsize in the config, since the tagged release hasn't happened yet to change the internals to use maxsize it uses threshold instead. giving an error like this ./dist/assets/es5.min.js: 65.19kb > threshold null gzip to fix change the property in your package.json to from maxsize to threshold . just popping this here for anyone getting the error.
