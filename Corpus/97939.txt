 URL : "https://github.com/drolbr/Overpass-API/issues/367" TITLE : if: .... - metadata checks BODY : note: i moved this topic over from 345, where it was sort of intermingled in test results. meta data checks missing ------ somehow, meta data checks seem to be missing: we only provide relevant functionality via the newer: filter today, although that could be easily extended to changeset id, object id and version. what's missing here is all the operator logic, in place for if: . in a way, the new if: filter doesn't yet fit perfectly into the existing filters, or i should say, some of the existing filters would probably benefit from being lifted into if: , while at the same time, the whole new filter concept then doesn't need to be called if: anymore. as an example: construction sites, which are older than 2 years. the current way of expressing this is way too complicated. something like @timestamp < '2015-01-01t00:00:00z would be a massive improvement. out:json timeout:25 ; // query part for: “landuse=construction and newer:365days” node landuse = construction newer: {{date:365days}} {{bbox}} ; way landuse = construction newer: {{date:365days}} {{bbox}} ; relation landuse = construction newer: {{date:365days}} {{bbox}} ; ->.neuere; // query part for: “landuse=construction and newer:3years” node landuse = construction newer: {{date:3years}} {{bbox}} ; way landuse = construction newer: {{date:3years}} {{bbox}} ; relation landuse = construction newer: {{date:3year}} {{bbox}} ; ->.aeltere; .aeltere; - .neuere; ; // print results out body; >; out skel qt;
