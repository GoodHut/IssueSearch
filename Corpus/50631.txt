 URL : "https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/issues/2437" TITLE : 400 bad request issues BODY : recently we were bitten by random 400 bad requests to our website due to header values exceeding 4k which is the default in cowboy. it was hard to debug this issue as there were no stack trace shown in the logs. to fix this issue i added this to the endpoint config: elixir http: protocol_options: max_request_line_length: 8192, max_header_value_length: 8192 therefore i would like to propose 2 changes in phoenix: 1. show better logs when 400 bad requests happen 2. increase the default max header values size to 8k
