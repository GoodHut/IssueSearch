 URL : "https://github.com/cooper/ferret/issues/53" TITLE : change the way fail works BODY : i'm thinking fail should not stop event propagation. the reason i made it do that is if subsequent callbacks depend on the one that failed, bad things might happen. but now i thought of something else that might be better. if a callback fails, cancel all subsequent callbacks which refer to the one that failed in an after priority hint.
