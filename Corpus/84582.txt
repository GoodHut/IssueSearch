 URL : "https://github.com/MaryIsbell/TheIllustratedArcticNews/issues/31" TITLE : deletion versus redaction BODY : should i be using the <del> tag for something that seems to be more of redacting information than a mistake? for example, in the letters in the first issue, names are intentionally left out and there will just be a line in place of the name. is that a deletion or something different?
