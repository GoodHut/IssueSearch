 URL : "https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native/issues/1023" TITLE : ios framework sample BODY : hello, i'm looking at kotine/native in terms of cross-platform development for ios and android. the idea, that one can implement ios app using kotlin is nice, but there no more usefulness than guinea pig project. experience of implementing objective-c code on kotlin using ide without code completion for native frameworks is headache, basically. the more interesting approach for practical usage, would be vice-versa - share some business logic, or computational algorithms implemented on kotlin between ios and android applications. in this case, kotlin code must be compiled as either ios static library .a , or, preferably, as ios framework. do you plan to provide such kind of sample either in this repository, either as separate one, as you did for kotlinconf-app and kotlinconf-spinner apps? with regards.
