 URL : "https://github.com/PRX/publish.prx.org/issues/431" TITLE : editable public feed url BODY : there are some cases where it's necessary to edit the public feed url the atom self link in the feed without entering a new feed url. should either: 1. make editable all the time, with a whole ton of warnings 2. make editable until feed has one episode i'm sort of leaning towards 1 , since you could have a bunch of episodes in a non-launched feed, and still be messing around with the public url.
