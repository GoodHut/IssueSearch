 URL : "https://github.com/krlmlr/styler/issues/176" TITLE : bang operator and spacing BODY : https://github.com/krlmlr/styler/blob/ef10c291034c05957c7a9f9d870db604f99f712a/r/rules-spacing.r l189 i was wondering whether this rule is really doing what you expect because it turns r a <- ! !!x into r a <- !!! x which is not the same anymore. @krlmlr probably we should only remove spaces if the token after is not ! ? because we still want r a <- ! false to become r a <- !false
