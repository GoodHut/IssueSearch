 URL : "https://github.com/duckbrain/ldss/issues/2" TITLE : search engine index BODY : search is fast if limited one or a few books, but searching over the entire catalog is time consuming. an index should help with that. this will require that the index be built when the books are being downloaded. there are currently no operations that occur on download of a book. this will have to change. the index should be stored in an sqlite database next the catalog json file. eg: ~/.ldss/eng/index.db
