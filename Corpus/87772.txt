 URL : "https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot-containers/issues/455" TITLE : manage all assigned links BODY : just a suggestion. maybe there should be a place, either in the containers addon preferences or in the main preferences, where you can manage all of your assigned tabs and their containers. sort of like the saved logins button on the security section of the preferences, except with more freedom to edit the assigned containers. ! image https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12703838/25112413/cbb236f8-23a5-11e7-8a12-881d6bd191dc.png
