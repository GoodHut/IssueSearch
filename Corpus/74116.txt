 URL : "https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/3053" TITLE : double click issue in d3 BODY : i implemented tree and force layout using d3. i added url call when double click on nodes. so expected behavior is when user double click on node, given url should open in new tab. but it reproduced some defects like for ie - 11.0.96 when user double click on child node it opens graph in new tab - correct behavior for ie - 11.576 when user double click on child node it opens blank page in new tab - incorrect behavior when user double click on parent node its not opens graph in new tab it just collapse and expands the nodes. - incorrect behavior.
