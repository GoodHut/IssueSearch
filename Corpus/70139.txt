 URL : "https://github.com/rucio/rucio/issues/261" TITLE : upload to local machine BODY : motivation ---------- in the xenon case, we have an origin server from which the files are uploaded to the source rse. the origin server and source rse are the same server. rather than doing a gfal-copy it would be better to do a mv / rsync of the data. modification ------------ add a flag to rucio upload or check the origin hostname whether the start and endpoint are the same machine.
