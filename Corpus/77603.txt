 URL : "https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-bindgen/issues/1131" TITLE : no link to release notes BODY : i couldn't find neither in docs.rs nor in the source tree a link or text versoin of the release notes posted on the discourse forum where you announced new version. it made it hard to find what were the incompatible changes and how to address them. i am talking about that page i had to dig it up from my phone browser history : https://users.rust-lang.org/t/bindgen-automatically-generate-rust-ffi-bindings-to-c-and-c-libraries/12126
