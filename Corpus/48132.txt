 URL : "https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/multipart-read-stream/issues/14" TITLE : remove pez dependency BODY : the latest releases of pez supports only node 8 and 9. i think we should think about removing it and writing our own good implementation of that, as ugly as it sounds. i don't remember why we moved from https://github.com/mscdex/busboy to pez. i recall problems that pez solved. a solution is to fork pez at https://github.com/hapijs/pez/commit/c7ff47dc57b22fd38b73c4fcb313f990e0b79c92 cc @davidmarkclements
