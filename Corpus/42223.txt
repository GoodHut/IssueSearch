 URL : "https://github.com/autodl-community/autodl-trackers/issues/194" TITLE : animebytes sub groups BODY : animebytes lets an upload be tagged by a certain subtitling group. dragon ball z - tv series   1989 :: bluray / mkv / h264 / 720p / aac / softsubs winxbloom1980 || https://animebytes.tv/torrents.php?id=1219&torrentid=312501 || adventure, comedy, drama, fantasy, martial.arts, scifi, shounen, super.power, classic, action, supernatural || uploaded by: sibuna2 it would be softsubs winxbloom1980 in this case. currently, it doesn't look like there's any way to filter by this. it's not in tags, that's separate, and it's not the release group either. looking at animebytes.tracker, it seems like certain strings are extracted then $releasetags is discarded? thanks in advance!
