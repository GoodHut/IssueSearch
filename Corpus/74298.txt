 URL : "https://github.com/matttraynar/Terrain/issues/1" TITLE : english field generation BODY : after doing a lot of research into this topic over the past few weeks i'm ready to start producing fields procedurally. i'll initially be creating the standard open field model with the distinctive ridge/furrow characteristics and three field rotation that can be found regularly in medieval settlements. this is something i'll be able to adapt further down the road to include enclosed fields and pasture grounds.
