 URL : "https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/4209" TITLE : link overlay confusion BODY : this is a more general issue as i would love us to explore a better adding a link experience. to be blunt, i had a lot of issues adding a link and overlaying was rife, for example: ! issue-link-overlay https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/253067/34443566-f25d36fc-ecbf-11e7-9cce-6b17ebc1c93f.png the issues were more it felt clumsy and just not the best. i don't come offering a better solution right now, however i think we need to bring our focus to this after we have iterated on the other experience hitches. right now, it's not as good as it could be.. so let's make it better. i think a good start is to begin looking at other implementations, what do other products do and how can we learn? also, does anyone have any ideas in the form of sketches for now - keep the low-fi and let's think about this issue before diving in.
