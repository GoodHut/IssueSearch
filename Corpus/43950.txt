 URL : "https://github.com/reactorlabs/rir/issues/16" TITLE : documentation general BODY : look at the code of the stable subsystems i.e. the compiler, ir instructions, ir representation from c++ and c's point of view, interpreter, analysis framework, buildsystem, running the tests and for each of them, create a markdown .md document in say the docs folder that would give an overview of the the given system works. these docs should not go into the detail in code comments should go to, but rather provide an introduction to the issues and workflows involved and hints on proper usage. in the future these docs are supposed to be kept in sync with code during code reviews. > this is for more people, each one can pick different system to document.
