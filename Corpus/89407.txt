 URL : "https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/issues/888" TITLE : public key authentication BODY : hi i am having trouble getting public key authentication to work with any other client then paramiko itself. i have a paramiko sftp server and client they work together fine. but it does not work from linux or filezilla, or any other client i tried so far. they all fall back on password authentication, which works fine. the issue seems to be in the authentication request. i always see this in the logs for any other client then paramiko: auth request type=none service=ssh-connection, username=me instead of: auth request type=publickey service=ssh-connection, username=me even though i force pk like this ssh -o preferredauthentications=publickey -i /home/sshtest/.ssh/open_open me@testserver this is done on debian testing: remote version/idstring: ssh-2.0-openssh_7.4p1 debian-6 paramiko: local version/idstring: ssh-2.0-paramiko_2.1.1 am i doing something wrong?
