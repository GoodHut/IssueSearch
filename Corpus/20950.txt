 URL : "https://github.com/DanielOgorchock/ST_Anything/issues/72" TITLE : dht library update BODY : newest stable version for both arm + avr processors same as what you currently have: https://github.com/robtillaart/arduino/tree/master/libraries/dhtstable new version optimized for avr which fixed some of my issues : https://github.com/robtillaart/arduino/tree/master/libraries/dhtlib not sure if you could include both in your library and then in the ps_temperaturehumidity files do a include based on processor architecture. like if arm add in dhtstable and otherwise add in dhtlib or something like that.
