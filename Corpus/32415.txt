 URL : "https://github.com/japgolly/scalajs-react/issues/418" TITLE : upgrade to react 16 BODY : this is going to be non-trivial. hopefully not a big deal either. for those salivating and pining in anticipating for this, i hope to get it done this month but no promises i have a family to support . also it will come out in v1.2.0. before then there'll be a minor release still on react 15.
