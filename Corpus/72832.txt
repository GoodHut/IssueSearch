 URL : "https://github.com/pipedown/noise/issues/51" TITLE : changing order and group BODY : i'd like to propose changing the language a bit to make it a bit more regular/consistent. order clause currently it is is: order .baz asc default=1 i'd like to change it to: order .baz default=1 asc reason: in return values it's: return {baz: .baz default=0, hammer: .hammer default=1} so it's <path> <default> kind of like a tuple . use this pattern for the order as well. grouping currently group is: group .baz order=asc default= a i'd like to change it to: group .baz default= a asc reason: it now has the same shape as the order clause. what do others think about making this change?
