 URL : "https://github.com/taye/interact.js/issues/566" TITLE : npm build is outdated BODY : hi. the latest version available https://www.npmjs.com/package/interactjs in npm is 1.2.9. since it seems there have been some breaking changes in 1.3.0 and i didn't see any mention about it in the docs, guess who've been going nuts wondering why the resizable ignored half of the options. an update would be appreciated ðŸ˜ƒ
