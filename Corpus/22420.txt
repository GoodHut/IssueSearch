 URL : "https://github.com/ysbaddaden/gc/issues/1" TITLE : large object space BODY : immix only describes the usual object space, used when allocating small objects smaller than a line or medium objects larger than a line, but smaller than a threshold . the large object space is left unspecified. looking at immixgc, they use an alternate mmap to bump allocate large objects, and seem to rely on a mark and sweep strategy. maybe i'll simply bump allocate in a mmap then keep a linked list of chunks that are either free or allocated, such an object can be inserted into the linked list, either before the free chunk if some space is left resizing the free chunk, or marking the chunk as allocated if it filled the hole.
