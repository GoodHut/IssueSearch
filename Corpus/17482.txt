 URL : "https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/issues/142" TITLE : plots do not show BODY : after performing a basic installation, i have tried first example at http://poliastro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide.html, having no errors but the plot is not displayed. after some research it seems that plt.show has to be called in order to display the graph. shouldn't that method be called from the plot function?
