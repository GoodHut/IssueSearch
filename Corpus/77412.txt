 URL : "https://github.com/babelouest/ulfius/issues/24" TITLE : need better json example BODY : really could use a simple, isolated example of proper json handling from within callback routines. unclear which data structures need to be dereferenced in the call back routine itself and which data structures should not be dereferenced because you're in a callback routine and they are de-referenced elsewhere. a simple client.c and server.c in which the client formulates a json message to send to the server and the server decomposes it into key-value pairs would probably do it. extra credit if the server response builds a json response and the client does the same with the response. ....or point me to a minimalist example elsewhere. the intended data structure life-cycle is not clearly documented. the api lists the calls but doesn't explain very well how they should be ordered.
