 URL : "https://github.com/go-kit/kit/issues/575" TITLE : add json rpc transport BODY : i found a need for json rpc http://www.jsonrpc.org on an upcoming project, and noticed that go-kit doesn't currently support this. i'd like to add this to the available transports. i notice that an attempt was made at this earlier this year pr 451 . there's a pr on its way that continues @blainsmith's work.
