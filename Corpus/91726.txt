 URL : "https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/2715" TITLE : unregister service worker BODY : just wondering what the easiest way to unregister an existing service worker is. i am on react-scripts : 1.0.7 . i'd be happy to provide more info if that makes it clearer what version of cra i'm using. the readme https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/readme.md making-a-progressive-web-app includes this passage if you had previously enabled service workers in your production deployment and have decided that you would like to disable them for all your existing users, you can swap out the call to serviceworkerregistration.register in src/index.js with a call to serviceworkerregistration.unregister . after the user visits a page that has serviceworkerregistration.unregister , the service worker will be uninstalled. i don't quite understand what i need to change in the src/index.js file to unregister the sw. i have tried importing the unregister func, and running that with no success. i apologize in advance if what i'm missing is very obvious. as a side note, i see the value in the service worker and think adding in as part of cra was a great move. for this particular use case however, i need my updates seen immediately. thanks!
