 URL : "https://github.com/plotly/dash/issues/64" TITLE : component request: table BODY : hi, based on a suggestion in https://github.com/plotly/dash/issues/53, i am calling out a couple of components that are very useful in the shiny world. it would be really useful to have a table component that can take a pandas data frame i believe that is the closest to the r data frame concept or something similar and display its contents in a rich table that allows column filtering and row selection. the dt package achieves this in shiny - https://rstudio.github.io/dt/shiny.html thanks iain
