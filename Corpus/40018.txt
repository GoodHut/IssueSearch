 URL : "https://github.com/probot/probot.github.io/issues/5" TITLE : sync production data BODY : the current website includes number of stars & installs, as well as a list of organizations/users that have the app installed. these will need to be synced regularly via a script. stars will be easy to get from the api. number of installs, and popular installs, may only be available via an authenticated api request from the installation itself. one crazy idea is to build in a /stats endopoint into probot itself that will return this data so every deployed probot plugin makes it available.
