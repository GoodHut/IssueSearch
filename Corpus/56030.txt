BODY : hey there, thanks for this super simple and tiny script, works great! i'm wondering if there's a way to add specific location manually, rather than using geo coordinates for determining the city itself? i found api info here: http://openweathermap.org/current name however i'm having some problems to modify the code to work with this.
