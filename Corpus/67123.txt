 URL : "https://github.com/facebook/osquery/issues/3212" TITLE : osqueryd misses changes BODY : on macos sierra 10.12 , create an osquery.conf file with the following contents: { schedule : { file_events : { query : select from file_events; , removed : false, interval : 10 } }, file_paths : { test : /foo/bar/% } } start osqueryd. if the /foo/bar/ path exists, any changes in bar will be logged as expected. however, if either foo or bar is missing at the time osqueryd launched, and then the full /foo/bar/ path is created after osqueryd is running, then any changes in bar after that point are not logged, unless osqueryd is terminated and relaunched. expected behavior: after the path is created, changes should be logged, without needing to restart osqueryd. from testing, this appears to be how osqueryd functions on linux.
