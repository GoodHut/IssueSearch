BODY : have somebody to sell you a vehicle and go to a dealership and type /viewstock. when you choose a car press enter once for the confirmation window to show up and then press f6 so you can start typing in the chat, enter /accept vehicle and then purchase the fourth vehicle through the dealership. nothing urgent as the /vmenu disallows to have four vehicles spawned at once but is not an intended feature. http://imgur.com/ybbedfx.png http://imgur.com/rsgfx72.png
