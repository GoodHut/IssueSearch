 URL : "https://github.com/tinali0923/Volatility-Prediction/issues/10" TITLE : midterm peer review BODY : this team aims to estimate the stock volatility based on stock fundamentals. overall, the team has done a good job for the midterm report. three things i like: 1. the graphs are pretty. 2. preliminary regression and analysis is meaningful in terms of understanding the topic. 3. the project report is neatly constructed. areas for improvement: i am concerned with the linear regression with all features, because some features have strong correlations between each other. maybe a better way to construct this model or explain it in the future?
