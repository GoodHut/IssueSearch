 URL : "https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-packages3D/issues/171" TITLE : wing pads on connectors BODY : not sure if this belong here or on the forum, let me know if its inappropriate here. how are people handling connecting the wing pads on connectors to different nets typically gnd ? usually i just edit the pads and add the net i want, but this is lost when updating the netlist, which usually makes me forget to change some of the 20ish pads. unless somebody has a good way, we should maybe consider making a standard padnumber for these. this way the user could use a symbol with or without the wings depending on the nescessity. thoughts?
