 URL : "https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-codec-netflow/issues/99" TITLE : redis plugin as input BODY : hello, this is not an issue and more like a brainstorm question, but i doubt someone else would be able to answer this except the developers of this codec themselves. all the examples including this codec use udp plugin as input and i was wondering could i use redis plugin as input? to be honest i have written my own codec using yours as an example because in my case is we are not using netflow but huawei dataflow instead, but those two are kinda similar. so i got the codec working with udp input, but am unable to run it with redis even tho redis claims that they are able to store binary safe strings. any thoughts?
