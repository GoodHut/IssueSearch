 URL : "https://github.com/kartoza/docker-geosafe/issues/53" TITLE : prepare rancher server BODY : we need to have our generic ansible scripts to deploy rancher server and configures rancher-agent for the agents, we probably just needed to setup the requirements . relevant documentations: http://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v1.6/en/quick-start-guide/ - prepare rancher server requirements: - docker ce installed note: we can use the same machine for teamcity for now: 78.47.48.45 - prepare rancher setup requirements: - docker ce installed note: for the agent, i think we just have to add the agent and label it manually and then done. there's not much thing ansible can do besides preparing docker.
