 URL : "https://github.com/google/pprof/issues/112" TITLE : clarify installation steps BODY : as a go newbie, i've been configuring both my $goroot and $gopath as /go . however, pprof refuses to build with this setup. console $ go get github.com/google/pprof warning: gopath set to goroot /go has no effect package github.com/google/pprof: cannot download, $gopath must not be set to $goroot. for more details see: go help gopath i tried mkdir -p /go-special && export gopath=/go-special , but the pprof build/installation process doesn't like that either. could the readme please be more explicit about the right way to do this?
