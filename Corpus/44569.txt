 URL : "https://github.com/dherges/ng-packagr/issues/116" TITLE : feat: more cli config BODY : type of issue - x feature request right now having a ng-package.json appears redundant. i propose that we should optionally be able to configure via the cli both the entry file and output name. for example ng-packagr --entryfile public_api.ts --libname mylibname i have a situation where all i want to use as config is a command line command, no extra files should be needed
