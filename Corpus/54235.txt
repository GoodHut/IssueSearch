 URL : "https://github.com/YaleSTC/vesta/issues/216" TITLE : fix policy consistency BODY : i'm pretty sure we sometimes use the action policy e.g. update? to define the view policy e.g. edit? and sometimes vice versa, especially with recent issues merged in all of the 167 issues come to mind . this should be fixed and i'm pretty sure our original method of using the action to define the view is the right one .
