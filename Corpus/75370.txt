 URL : "https://github.com/FACG2/project-manager/issues/39" TITLE : handlers.js is very long BODY : this project is really ambitious and it's nice to see you trying for something big! really big files can be quite hard to deal with and when reading the code it can be quite complex, when you have hundreds of lines it can just be quite hard to see what is going on. if your handlers.js file is getting long i would probably describe long as 100 or more lines then it can be worth separating your handlers into separate files as well, inside of a handlers directory, each file doesn't have to be for one handler, could have something like getdatahandlers.js , postdatahandlers.js , handlestatic.js etc.
