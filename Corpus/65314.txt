 URL : "https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1957" TITLE : incorrect true anomaly? BODY : i had 2 craft in circular orbits, at the time 180 degrees apart. print ship:orbit:trueanomaly gave about 275 print targetvessel:orbit:trueanomaly gave about 251 the values did change with time, but the difference in degrees was not even close to 180. am i missing something or does :trueanomaly give incorrect values?
