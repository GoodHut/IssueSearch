 URL : "https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/17147" TITLE : add an u int128 type BODY : while i know it does exist biginteger sometimes it would be needed to have a type that is explicit 128 bit and nothing more probably it would be more efficient too at least in a 64 bit machine at it could be represented as a couple of the long . an int128 is the natural type of guid, ip6 addresses and more at low level but nevertheless true x86 instruction cpuid returns 4 integers in 4 registers that need to be concatenated to get the real value, the real intent was to return an int128. i have doubt if an alias could exist if a long is abbreviation of longword and int128 could be octa as abbreviation of octaword ?
