 URL : "https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_LIS3DH/issues/10" TITLE : fluctuating accel. outputs BODY : hi there, i am currently running 4 lis3dh chips in spi configuration, outputting accel data @ 12bit high res 200hz, +/- 2gs configuration. the chips are not moving, and i noticed from the serial output terminal that the x,y,z acceleration value fluctuates in random intervals. the fluctuation applies throughout all of the lis3dh chips, and is consistently scaled up/down by 2 on all acceleration axes output, in the same set of readings. e.g. x:1.01 y:-0.06 z:9.50m/s^2 fluctuates to x:2.09 y:-0.25 z:19.08m/s^2 in the next data set . the raw value seems to have this pattern of fluctuation as well scaled by 2 . e.g. z raw: 15936 to 31424 . am i missing something? anyone have a similar encounter? thanks!
