 URL : "https://github.com/heavenshell/vim-jsdoc/issues/66" TITLE : autodetect params type BODY : there is code-analysis engine for javascript named term http://ternjs.net/ which actually analyses js code very well. one of the feature - it can automatically, based on the code, determine the type of variable/parameter. you can try it out online on this demo page http://ternjs.net/doc/demo/index.html simple . also, there is vim plugin https://github.com/ternjs/tern_for_vim for this. so, my question is: is there any chase vim-jsdoc plugin could be integrated with the term engine to automatically generate/suggest types for @parameters/@return statements?
