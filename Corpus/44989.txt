 URL : "https://github.com/Shippable/support/issues/3329" TITLE : git submodule failing BODY : hi, our git submodule update has stopped working. example build: 588a36c1adf5420f00f35a4b the submodule is also a repo we have set up in shippable so i don't understand why it's stopped working. i've been through and reset both projects to ensure the deploy keys are set but it's still failing. thanks
