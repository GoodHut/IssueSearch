 URL : "https://github.com/quinoacomputing/quinoa/issues/178" TITLE : rename carrier to cg BODY : this will be a better name for expressing what this class does from inline documentation : >cg advances a system of transport equations using continuous galerkin cg finite elements with linear >shapefunctions for spatial discretization combined with a time stepping discretization that is equivalent to >the lax-wendroff lw scheme within the unstructured-mesh finite element context and treats continuities >with flux-corrected transport fct .
