 URL : "https://github.com/w0rp/ale/issues/654" TITLE : errors in preview window BODY : sometimes read most of the times for me the output of a linter is too verbose for a single line of output as we get in the location list or the echo area. i find myself in haskell for example running the linter externally anyway so i can get 1 highlighting 2 nice-formatted messages. neither 1 or 2 have to do anything with the feature i'm requesting, but they aren't possible without it. so this would be the first step to eventually achieving them. the behavior would be the same as that of g:ale_echo_cursor , except instead of the lint message being displayed in the echo area it would in a preview window.
