 URL : "https://github.com/Sloeber/arduino-eclipse-plugin/issues/725" TITLE : multiple .ino files BODY : first, a big thank you to the developers of this project, eclipse is a vastly superior ide vs arduino ide. i am using v4.0 and downloaded the product bundle. i am working on a project with multiple .ino files a mod of https://github.com/goebish/nrf24_multipro i can work on and build the main .ino file, but the moment i open any of the accompanying .ino files or add a new one, multiple errors are thrown. the project still seems to build with the arduino plugin, however errors remain. when project is opened in arduino or other ide, i have no issues with the same multiple .ino files. i'm a noob to eclipse, so perhaps my lack of understanding of how work-spaces are handled, etc are contributing to my issue.
