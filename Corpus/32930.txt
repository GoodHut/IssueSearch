BODY : in .show : void cfastled::show uint8_t scale { // guard against showing too rapidly while m_nminmicros && micros -lastshow < m_nminmicros ; ... that looks like a blocking while loop. would it introduce problems to change this to use the yield function? for an avr, this probably translates to a nop. for devices with other background tasks i'm looking at you, esp8266 , this would allow the wifi stack to get serviced. void cfastled::show uint8_t scale { // guard against showing too rapidly while m_nminmicros && micros -lastshow < m_nminmicros { yield ; }
