 URL : "https://github.com/nunit/nunit.xamarin/issues/87" TITLE : update to android 7.1 BODY : updating to android 7.1 would allow the runner to use the wider netstandard-1.6 framework, and allow updating xamarin forms. it's currently non-trivial due to not being included in the default image for the appveyor ci - but that's in the pipeline to be updated, see: https://github.com/appveyor/ci/issues/1280 @rprouse - how much are we worrying about backwards compatibility here? i've never done much any android development, but it doesn't see too hot on backwards compatibility https://developer.android.com/training/basics/supporting-devices/platforms.html version-codes . i'm not sure on the effects of trying to load a netstandard dll in an older android level - i imagine they could be unpleasant!
