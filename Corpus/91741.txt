 URL : "https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/1830" TITLE : unwanted port redirection BODY : is this a bug report or feature request? choose one : bug report behavior change since 0.9.0 nginx ingress controller version : quay.io/kubernetes-ingress-controller/nginx-ingress-controller:0.9.0 kubernetes version use kubectl version : 1.7.11 environment : - cloud provider or hardware configuration : bare metal, amd64 - os e.g. from /etc/os-release : ubuntu 16.04.3 lts xenial xerus - kernel e.g. uname -a : 4.4.0-96-generic - install tools : kubeadm - others : what happened : when redirecting an url the ingress controller specify the port given by the option --https-port if the port is not the default 443 port for https . this change is due to 1769 . the problem is that my ingress controller is behind a load balancer, and the port used between these 2 equipments 40443 aren't the same as the public port 443 on the load balancer: end user -->443 load balancer 40443-->40443 ingress controller --> some services . so after the redirection the user won't be able to access the website because he will try to contact the load balancer on the closed port 40443. if i use the version quay.io/kubernetes-ingress-controller/nginx-ingress-controller:0.9.0-beta.19 the problem is gone. what you expected to happen : the ingress controller should do the same things as before don't set the https ports in http to https redirections or i should be able to specify the public https port for redirects. how to reproduce it as minimally and precisely as possible : setup an ingress controller with --https-port=40443 , add a http to https redirect rule to an ingress rule. the redirect will specify the 40443 port redirect to https://some-domain:40443/ .
