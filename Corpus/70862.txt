 URL : "https://github.com/nikhil-97/MicroP_Group41/issues/1" TITLE : !! extremely insecure !! BODY : the code written is just for a highly constrained environment, i.e. only one pi, only one user, and just a temporary code for presentation. it is highly insecure and implementing the same code without adding extra security is strictly not recommended if you value your project. : p there is no checking of mac address of incoming connection. anyone can connect to the pi and run it. only this will not suffice, because mac spoofing can be done . have to look into additional checks which can be done.
