BODY : just trying mopidy out right now i admit. but one thing i notice on a first sally and i'm using sqlite local library is the 12 tracks in one album 11 appear in the database in one album and one in another album, of exactly the same name! and i'm bamboozled as to why. if i look in the database album table the single track album has exactly the same name though the artists field is blank in this single track album. if i examine the album in puddletag i see easily that the album and artist are identical. but, here's what i noticed, the one track in the one track album has album artist set the other 11 don't. and it's set to the identical string yes with whitespace checks as artist. but this caused a split. so i'm wondering by what criteria is an album an album? could be a mopidy question if this extension receives it split already not sure who drives the local scan and categorisation . in which case just point me that way and close this. i can move it to mopidy with some learning under my belt.
