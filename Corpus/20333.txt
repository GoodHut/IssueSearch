 URL : "https://github.com/orientechnologies/OrientDB-NET.binary/issues/147" TITLE : cannot set timeout BODY : is there anyway to set the timeout of an insert, update, or select statement other than running the query with ... timeout 30000 exception on the end? it seems like there should be a way to pass a timeout into the api without having to build every query by hand. thank you in advance.
