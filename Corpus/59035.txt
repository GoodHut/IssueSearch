 URL : "https://github.com/mheese/journalbeat/issues/60" TITLE : tail mode not tailing? BODY : i would expect seek_position: head to grab only new journal log lines as they happen. occasionally i want to dump the backlog and just start logging fresh. something like the -f option in journalctl. however, journalbeat appears to be shipping all of my log history in journalctl. i am running an older version of journalctl, so i can't easily use the --vacuum option to delete old logs. can you take a look at the code and check about tail mode? am i misinterpreting how tail is expected to work? does tail mean 'oldest' or 'newest'? log output: 2017/03/31 20:27:09.685509 logstash.go:90: info max retries set to: 3 2017/03/31 20:27:09.685608 outputs.go:106: info activated logstash as output plugin. 2017/03/31 20:27:09.685704 publish.go:291: info publisher name: journalbeat 2017/03/31 20:27:09.686053 async.go:63: info flush interval set to: 1s 2017/03/31 20:27:09.686066 async.go:64: info max bulk size set to: 2048 2017/03/31 20:27:09.688212 journalbeat.go:50: info seek to tail successful 2017/03/31 20:27:09.688291 beat.go:207: info journalbeat start running. 2017/03/31 20:27:09.688304 journalbeat.go:129: info journalbeat is running! 2017/03/31 20:27:09.688523 state.go:119: warn could not read the pending queue: open .journalbeat-pending-queue: no such file or directory 2017/03/31 20:27:09.688533 state.go:121: info loaded 0 events, trying to publish yaml: journalbeat: seek_position: tail cursor_seek_fallback: tail cursor_flush_period: 5s clean_field_names: true convert_to_numbers: false move_metadata_to_field: journal write_cursor_state: false name: journalbeat output.logstash: enabled: true hosts: ${logstash_host} logging.to_files: false
