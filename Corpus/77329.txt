BODY : hello, first off, nice work. i've been able to get everything running, even xdebug. well done. however : there is one thing i'm struggling with atm : i would be much obliged should you be able to help me. i'm confused whether mysql is already installed : i'm trying to log in using the cli mysql command, but i cannot enter using standard root-root user-pwd combo. i then tried installing mysql-server package, but even then i cannot change user credentials for root. i've checked the dockerfile / start script, but i only came across the fact that the php extensiosn mysqli / mysqlpdo are installed, so i was wondering if mysql is installed natively on this image, and if so : how can i retriever root password? as always, should you require more information, don't hesitate to ask.
