 URL : "https://github.com/NagiosEnterprises/nagioscore/issues/379" TITLE : mac os compile errors BODY : i was able to compile by using make -i to ignore all warnings and errors. core only has a few but the plugins compile is in the hundred+ errors. mostly due to deprecated calls or unsigned integers apparently darwin hates that kind of thing. i am attaching a rtf of the console log of the compile of both core and plugins. i don't have the skill to offer up fixes to the source code to the community, but will gladly offer up these logs. compileerrors.txt https://github.com/nagiosenterprises/nagioscore/files/1046500/compileerrors.txt
