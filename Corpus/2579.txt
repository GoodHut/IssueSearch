 URL : "https://github.com/jmosbech/mail-null/issues/12" TITLE : broken on osx BODY : hey, the project appears to be broken on osx: mail-null yields: env: node\r: no such file or directory a quick search shows that this might be related to dos line endings: https://github.com/nwjs/nw-builder/issues/75 and indeed, after i removed the line break in bin/mail-null after the shebang, everything works fine. would you be willing to change your project/git settings to unix line breaks so that this can be used on osx as well? thanks
