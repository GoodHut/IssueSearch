 URL : "https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula/issues/770" TITLE : thousands comma issue BODY : the values in my tables over 1000 have a comma every three digits i.e. 3,000 . when i extract the data for excel it is deliminated using commas. when i open the exported file, i end up with extra columns that have my values split between cells i.e. a column with 3 and another with 000 . is there any way to change the deliminator? excel will allow the user to select a different symbol when importing. thank you for your help!
