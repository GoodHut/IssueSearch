 URL : "https://github.com/lukechilds/keyv/issues/12" TITLE : add increment option. BODY : both mongodb and redis support a way increment variables directly. it would be nice to have something similar here. specifically i am wanting to use keyv to implement a rate limiter but without increment it's impossible to do so. may be out of scope for the module but i thought it'd be cool.
