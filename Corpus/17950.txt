 URL : "https://github.com/viper-framework/viper/issues/538" TITLE : scope of modules? BODY : this is not really an issue... more a question: what is the scope of modules? the reason for asking is that it seems that almost all modules operate on a single file only. but there are exceptions. for example yara scan -a will scan all files in the current project not in all projects . i haven't checked all modules, but i guess there are more modules that don't strictly operate on a single file, right? the reason for asking this is that i'm thinking about adding the possibility to run modules to the django web api i'm working the current api already supports this . i would like the api to have a logical hierarchy also for the modules e.g. .. /project/default/module/pe/ vs. .. /project/default/malware/sha256/module/pe/
