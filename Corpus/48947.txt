 URL : "https://github.com/auth0/wt-cli/issues/159" TITLE : store current profile BODY : overview today wt-cli supports multiple profiles allowing you to specify --profile with each command to use that profile for execution. when doing a bunch of steps or even scripting them, it's annoying to have to pass --profile over and over. proposal introduce a wt profile current name command which will set and persist the selected profile name. if current is set, that profile will be used by default. by default current will be set to default . if a user decides to change to a different profile they can use the new command. this state would be persisted locally like in the .webtask file and not as part of their account. if the current profile is deleted, then an error will be returned if a command is executed. this ensures that the user knows that the profile is gone, rather than automatically falling back to another profile.
