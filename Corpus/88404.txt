 URL : "https://github.com/dingo/api/issues/1399" TITLE : newrelic cannot catch uri BODY : hello, i'm trying to use newrelic but it cannot catch route details. like controller@action. i only see /index.php and /unknown on new relic. it seems, new relic tries to catch by using laravel's default router. but it is null on api requests. so it cannot determine about details. is there anyone facing this problem before?
