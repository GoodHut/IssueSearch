 URL : "https://github.com/arvidn/libtorrent/issues/1592" TITLE : how to debug endless loop? BODY : i could reprduce an issue with non starting client ui because of to expensive process executions. do you have an idea to check at which methods the process got stuck with 100% load? if i use qbittorent client i don't get any output if i reach the code which cause the 100% stuck. i can't even trigger the exit method calls, it just log catching signal: sigint exiting cleanly and is still stuck with 100% load. this does happen with the debug compilation and would like to figure out which checks are to expensive for debugging. this could be related to issues where users don't see ui with an debug build.
