 URL : "https://github.com/pablopunk/microsec/issues/4" TITLE : npm module fetch wrapper BODY : wrap fetch or isomorphic-fetch to fetch all urls through a secure server. something like: js const microsec = require 'microsec' microsec url .then console.log maybe it would be nice to make it so it fetches with custom module: js const fetch = require 'isomorphic-fetch' const microsec = require 'microsec' fetch // factory microsec url .then console.log the last one would mean kind of knowing if the url is passed as an argument or as an object { url, headers, method } but i guess the first one is usually the standard.
