BODY : for some reason, loading in large numbers of spectra seems to take temporarily! an extremely large amount of ram, well in excess of the space required to store the spectra. for example, when running the following, sdb = specdb db_file=db_file qdict = {'z_pipe': 2.09,2.51 , 'snr_spec': 4,1000.0 , 'bal_flag_vi': 0, 'zwarning': 0} qmeta = sdb.query_meta qdict,groups= 'boss_dr12' spec = sdb.spectra_from_meta qmeta specdb claims: staged 26668 spectra totalling 2.48012 gb the ram usage after loading in the spectra is ~3.9 gb; while this is higher than expected, it is not completely crazy. however, _during the loading process_, the ram usage first jumps to ~8.4 gb, drops down to ~3.9 gb, then spikes to 12 gb. that seems a little extreme!
