 URL : "https://github.com/clarkie/dynogels/issues/65" TITLE : pure-js logging package? BODY : i'm a bit frustrated with bunyan as it uses native add-ons. at the moment the pain this causes me is frequent needs for npm rebuild when i switch between node v4 for aws lambda and node v6 where debugging works well . i also just find it annoying when there are native modules without a really compelling reason, and i don't think logging records to stdout justifies native add-ons. i have no need for the d-trace baggage bunyan brings along with it. just starting this issue to see if anyone else is motivated to maybe swap in bole .
