 URL : "https://github.com/Owyn/HandyImage/issues/265" TITLE : hey there owyn! BODY : i couldn't find you on essential mana anymore since the forums were taken down and i couldn't communicate with you there, i wanted to ask for help with your old tera boss hp bar mod, it broke in the new patch since the health number of bosses is just so high, my guildmates have enjoyed your work for the longest time and i couldn't find a way to help them with this issue so i thought that perhaps you could figure something out. if this is the wrong place to speak these things out then i am active on discord, thank you from advance.
