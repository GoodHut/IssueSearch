 URL : "https://github.com/howtographql/howtographql/issues/296" TITLE : graphql 0.10.5 breaks BODY : installing on a new machine, i ran across this as of commit 0000023 message: schema must be an instance of graphqlschema. also ensure that there are not multiple versions of graphql installed in your node_modules directory. deleting node_modules and locking the version to 0.10.3, then running yarn install appears to fix it. e.g. editing package.json so that graphql: 0.10.3 locks the version. i'm going to see if i can track down the breaking change, as we're trying to use this as an educational tool within our company.
