 URL : "https://github.com/uber/react-vis/issues/467" TITLE : canvasseries api change BODY : the current api for making series flip into canvas mode is kind of cumbersome. while it is really pleasant to simply say rectseriescanvas, it is not exactly developer friendly to have each of these broken out into it's own series. it means we have to test and document double the number of components. given this, i propose a breaking api change: - add a new prop to all series: rendermethod - delete all canvas series and move the canvas rendering into the component itself this would significantly deflate the number of series components, and it would leave room for us to add new rendering systems at some point in the future regl? deck.gl? reactnative? . love to hear thoughts
