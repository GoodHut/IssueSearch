 URL : "https://github.com/csete/gpredict/issues/95" TITLE : user's manual - request BODY : charles phillips sent us the following request for user manual updates: > on page 46 of the new version the discussion is about how to update from local files, could alexandru add a specific note that you must select the directory and cannot select the enclosed file? i mainly run command line unix applications and when i run a program that reads a file, i of course include the exact file name in my command. i am a macintosh guy and when i do most things under the gui with files i select the file i want to operate on. > > i am still running 1.3 of course; i plan to move to 2.0 when it is available via macports. > > but with gpredict in this case - if you select the file inside the directory it does not work and there is not a useful error message. this is counterintuitive for me at least. does it still work that way in version 2.0? > > it would be more clear in the user's manual if it said that you cannot select the file. another nice addition would be a message when you select the file, that you should select the directory. another option is to allow the user to select either the directory or the file, i don't know how that might affect other versions. source: https://sourceforge.net/p/gpredict/mailman/message/36153156/
