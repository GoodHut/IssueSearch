 URL : "https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate/issues/13" TITLE : package built wrong BODY : when referencing the package using the import statement: import { machine } from 'xstate' it says it can't find xstate. if i open the npm package.json found here: node_modules/xstate/package.json and change line 5 to this: main : dist/xstate.js , that error goes away. maybe there is a better fix, but hopefully that gives you enough info, here is the package.json after i changed it: package copy.txt https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate/files/1279678/package.copy.txt . thanks!
