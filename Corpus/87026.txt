 URL : "https://github.com/QUVA-Lab/artemis/issues/91" TITLE : integrate version control BODY : it'd be nice for reproducibility to also keep track of the state of the code when an experiment is done. this could be done by one of the following: 1. copying the active code and saving it 2. doing an automatic git commit when an experiment is run 3. just saving the current hash and leaving it up to the user to commit. option 2 looks most reasonable to me, but may pollute the commit history with a ton of tiny commits. maybe a solution is to have artemis keep a separate <current_branch>.experiments branch, so every time you run an experiment, artemis: - stash current branch - checks out the <current_branch>.experiments branch - commits - checks out <current_branch> . - load the stashed state.
