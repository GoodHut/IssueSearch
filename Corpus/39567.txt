 URL : "https://github.com/glitch-soc/mastodon/issues/88" TITLE : site notification ui BODY : initially, this idea was proposed as an automatic notification for when a site update happens, but it could also be given a ui for admins to disable that setting and even send their own messages, to all users or other admins. the idea is to put a space in the site where the site itself tells you there's a new version available for you to refresh, without this getting dug into your notification feed or anything. i've done some mockups of the idea here: ! exclamationpointmockup https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15249812/28431387-2fdc989e-6d52-11e7-801e-313b6dc94e7b.png ! adminnotifmockup https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15249812/28431391-31ab5b24-6d52-11e7-903f-495769639924.png
