 URL : "https://github.com/infusionsoft/infusionsoft-php/issues/119" TITLE : endpoints not working? BODY : using your example for tasks, e.g. $tasks = $infusionsoft->tasks ->all ;, i get the error below which implies there is no tasks method? fatal error: uncaught error: call to undefined method infusionsoft\infusionsoft::tasks my code should be working fine because contacts works ok, i can get firstname back: $contacts = $infusionsoft->contacts ->load 21, array 'firstname' ; i'm trying to list all campaigns, but same issue as tasks. where is there more documentation on how to call the end points? thanks
