 URL : "https://github.com/dweidenfeld/plexdrive/issues/141" TITLE : chunks downloaded twice BODY : - current plexdrive build from git - plexdrive mount with small chunk size 4mb - rclone crypt mount on top with bandwidth limiter 5mb/s - fast reading like a local copy the debug log and bandwidth consumption tells me that every chunk is being downloaded twice. rclone stats & actual copy rate show that it is limited to the correct bandwidth as specified to rclone crypt mount. the resulting consumed network interface bandwidth is roughly equal to double the rclone bandwidth. raising the chunk size 8mb makes this go away almost completely
