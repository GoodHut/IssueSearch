 URL : "https://github.com/raivis-vitols/ghost-theme-willow/issues/12" TITLE : post image sizes BODY : i seen that all of your post image sizes are the same which is why it lines up pretty perfect. is there a way you could make it so regardless of the picture size, make the picture fit some fixed size, and have the rows of post be lined up evenly? tldr - is there a way to keep all posts aligned while not having to worry about post image sizes before hand?
