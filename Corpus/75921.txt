 URL : "https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/900" TITLE : implement shallow clone? BODY : if i want to implement a traverse-and-copy algorithm, but copying only some nodes selectively, my first idea would be to use a shallow clone and traverse the jsoup dom. since the dom is kinda immutable, how can i implement this? a shallow clone eg: exposing doclone i guess would be ideal, otherwise i would have to implement a shallow clone myself.
