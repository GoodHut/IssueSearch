 URL : "https://github.com/sjhuskey/Calpurnius_Siculus/issues/3" TITLE : <note> in <rdggrp> BODY : i have inserted <note>vel</note> between all the conjectured readings in editio.xml where giarratano does something like heins. _lorem_ vel _ipsum_ vel _dolor_ all of those readings are enclosed by <rdggrp>. since <note> isn't currently allowed in <rdggrp>, there are now several errors in editio.xml. in an email exchange on december 8, you suggested that you might regenerate the schema against the release branch that allows <note> in <rdggrp>. once that is done, i think we'll just have to address some of the lingering questions that i have made in comments throughout editio.xml.
