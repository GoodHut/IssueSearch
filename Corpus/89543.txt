 URL : "https://github.com/yunit-io/yunit/issues/86" TITLE : questions about ui and ux BODY : unity7's and 8's ideas and base implementation set a very strong ux story for yunit but i'm curios and a bit concerned about yunit's ui/ux story going forward. are engineers contributing to yunit going to take on the design work as well? is anyone from the original canoical design team involved in the effort? may be the community should request canonical to release all internal design plans and mockups for unity7 and 8 so yunit could benefit from them in the months and years to come. it would also make sense in future to seek help from the members of the team that designed unity to guide yunit's design further.
