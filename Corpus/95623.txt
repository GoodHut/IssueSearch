 URL : "https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-cloud-angular/issues/41" TITLE : deploy.load fails silently BODY : hi guys, trying to get this package running with my angular 2 + cordova app. i have setup everything good so far, and the app checks and downloads updates when available. but after extracting and calling this.deploy.load , the app hangs on the splash screen, without any errors in the console. not calling deploy.load and restarting manually results in the same. i'm testing on a galaxy s7. these are the versions of the specific packages: // cli ionic -v 2.2.1 cordova -v 6.5.0 // ng2 @ionic/cloud-angular : ^0.9.1 , // cordova plugin ionic-plugin-deploy 0.6.5
