 URL : "https://github.com/swisscom/open-service-broker/issues/9" TITLE : mysql or mariadb BODY : as the readme says i can use either mysql or mariadb, i initially used a mysql docker 5.7.18 to run the broker, but was running into an error during provisioning of a service. > provisionrequest.plan.service = null 2017-06-26 14:45:06.629 error 10455 --- nio-8080-exec-8 c.s.c.s.b.controller.basecontroller : uncaught error >java.lang.nullpointerexception: cannot get property 'asyncrequired' on null object today i noticed an update to the readme.txt showing how to deploy a mariadb docker 10.1.24-mariadb-1~jessie and thought i'd try it out and it works. > provisionrequest.plan.service = com.swisscom.cloud.sb.broker.model.cfservice@6c1141a0 no code changes between the two runs. pointing this out for anyone struggling with the same issue.
