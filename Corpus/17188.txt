BODY : hi, i just found this project and it looks great. are releases still being made, or is it recommended to simply use the master branch? looking at the releases page, there seems that in the past ~2015 releases were made with a few weeks or months in between, but then stopped at 2.0.2 may 2015 . thanks in advance for any clarification!
