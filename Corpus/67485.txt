 URL : "https://github.com/seanmtracey/CineList-API/issues/16" TITLE : potential caching issue BODY : hi sean, i've been querying your api to access my local cinema listings today 06/08/2017 and have just noticed that it appears to be returning the results from yesterday 05/08/2017 . if i set the day to 1 it will return tomorrows dates and so i have no way to access the listings today. if you query the faf api directly it seems to return the correct results so i would assume that it must be caching the results somewhere. if it's useful my cinema is vue, hull and has id 9669 and i used the following website to prove that it is displaying yesterday's viewings... https://www.view.co.uk/hull/v/vue-cinema-hull/cinema-listings let me know if there is any other information you need. thanks, rob
