BODY : one thing ma'am... what's the use of it!!! it's only for display of alternate menu items of ninjaforms like manage | submissions | import / export | settings ... what a editor / author / contributor / subscriber will do with manage | submissions | import / export | settings ??? it would have more useful if it would have different option for different user role in submission itself... like... editor can delete / modify any submission... author can delete / modify it's own submission... contributor can modify it's own submission but can not delete the submission... subscriber can only view the submission...
