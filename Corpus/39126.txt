 URL : "https://github.com/juju-solutions/matrix/issues/102" TITLE : resources in testing BODY : we would like to be able to include resources in our automated testing. we want to be able to run tests against local binaries that would be attached to the controller at the time of testing. this way we will be able to verify the correctness of the binaries/resources before we actually upload them to the store. the need for this has come up during development of the ci for kubernetes charms. thank you
