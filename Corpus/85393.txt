 URL : "https://github.com/EFForg/https-everywhere/issues/13536" TITLE : expose popup ui to fennec BODY : type: feature request currently, https everywhere works on fennec but there is no way to disable/enable rules, add custom rules, etc. since there is no concept of a 'popup.' we should expose these options in the fennec ui.
