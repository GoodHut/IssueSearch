 URL : "https://github.com/sketch-city/harvey-api/issues/64" TITLE : todo - delete button BODY : would like to mark something for deletion, or delete. recently contacted by someone requesting we remove their shelter. updated info, but would be nice to just delete the record instead. not sure if deleting shelter name and coordinates would do it?
