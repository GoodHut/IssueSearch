 URL : "https://github.com/AllenCellModeling/torch_integrated_cell/issues/7" TITLE : the reconstruction error BODY : in your work, the reconstruction error is measured by pixel-wise binary crossentropy loss, which is bcecriterion in torch. however, the in the torch documentation for this loss function, https://github.com/torch/nn/blob/master/doc/criterion.md nn.bcecriterion, the output can be between 0 and 1 but the target t i should be either 0 or 1. the target of image reconstruction error is the original image x^r or x^r,s, but it has discrete values between 0 and 1. so why the binary crossentropy loss can work for reconstruction error? thanks.
