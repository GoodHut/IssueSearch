 URL : "https://github.com/choderalab/yank/issues/801" TITLE : bond order preservation BODY : we need to trap bond order information for small molecules. we can do this either through extending the mdtraj topology object in topography, or by switching to the openmm topology in topography. yank will still need to capture this information from small molecules when available, even after the molecule is piped through antechamber. alternately, this information needs to be accepted if not stored at times when it is needed e.g. smarts selection at topography.select , maybe a .select ..., kwargs which get passed down to selector ? if we need to switch to openeye molecules from openmm topology, use the oess/oemmtools repo code for openmmtop_to_oemol which should be permissively copiable.
