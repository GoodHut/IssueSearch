 URL : "https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/issues/15977" TITLE : jform b/c broken BODY : steps to reproduce the issue having a form defined like this: xml <?xml version= 1.0 encoding= utf-8 ?> <form> <fields name= custom_fields /> </form> note: i've only added the fields section to explain how this issue happens. custom_fields is just an empty fields section there to allow field injection. before you could do this to add a field to a form fields section: $xml = '<field type= text name= test-field label= test field />'; $form->setfield new \simplexmlelement $xml , 'custom_fields' ; and retrieve the field like: $field = $form->getfield 'test-field', 'custom_fields' ; which was returning the correct field. after this: https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/pull/14737 it looks like we are now forcing that a fieldset exists on the fields section: //fields @name= custom_fields /fieldset @name= default because the new $fieldset param added to the function: https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/pull/14737/files diff-ed54af5d39d21ed9a84d28eba903bd5fr1082 so the field is never return. expected result i'd expect b/c. so if fieldset was not required before now it shouldn't. before this xml worked: xml <fields name= custom_fields > <!-- fields here --> </fields> actual result now fieldset is mandatory so you need an structure like: xml <fields name= custom_fields > <fieldset name= default > <!-- fields here --> </fieldset> </fields> system information as much as possible joomla v3.7.0 additional comments see https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/pull/14737
