 URL : "https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js/issues/3879" TITLE : documentation / example BODY : hello, i use this lib since the v1/beta and from the v2 i get a bit lost each time i have to reuse pixi on a project after a long time without using it. the api changed each time, and thats good it evolve but at the same time it's annoying to google it and found some pixiv2 doc, outdated infos a lot and stuffs like that. the current stage of pixi make me feel the lib is incredibly powerfull but if you are not fullstack pixijs dev or don't know the right peoples to ask the advanced questions, its painfull to get into it even with good programmation skills & experiences i suggest for the good of the project to re-organize the current ressources with standard url / improving seo of it, and work on some content to ease & improve the use of pixijs: pixijs.com/ manual : introduce the concept basic & advanced, see starling http://manual.starling-framework.org/en/ pixijs.com/ performance : tips about performance, see starling again http://manual.starling-framework.org/en/ _performance_optimization pixijs.com/ docs : official latest doc with all features + micro example , see threejs https://threejs.org/examples/ webgl_postprocessing_glitch pixijs.com/ examples : cover the maximum of features individually not only trivial one, basically one by feature/class + advanced examples , again threejs https://threejs.org/docs/ reference/geometries/boxbuffergeometry i know its work to provide there but with the community pixi have im sure it'll be worth it!
