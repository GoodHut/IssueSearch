 URL : "https://github.com/davidstutz/bootstrap-multiselect/issues/879" TITLE : dropdown will not open BODY : i have copied some sample code into my website to try out your multi-select i am adding the select component via an ajax partial page update. the component is displayed correctly, but clicking on it will not open the dropdown. i tried copying the entire page from google chromes developer tools into a new html page and it worked fine. dropdown and all. it seems that i don't have any conflicts, but the problem seems to have something to be with the partial page update which contains the select component. any ideas how i can tackle debugging this?
