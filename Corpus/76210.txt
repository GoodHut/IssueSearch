 URL : "https://github.com/City-of-Bloomington/OnBoard/issues/202" TITLE : integration install test BODY : we really need to have a test to check if the web application has everything installed as expected. we keep forgetting to set up cron scripts, backups, nagios monitoring, etc. we could write a phpunit integration test that can be run by ansible. it's going to be run on the production server. while we need to it make sure everything is working correctly, we need to make sure it doesn't do any permanent changes to the production data.
