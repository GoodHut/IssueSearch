 URL : "https://github.com/igvteam/igv.js/issues/303" TITLE : handling css and img files BODY : hi jim and co, i've noticed that there are a few css and img files that may or may not be needed by igv.js the wiki recommends hotlinking the css file on igv.org, is that still the correct/recommended practice? https://github.com/igvteam/igv.js/wiki/dependencies --- if igv-gtex.css, igv.css and opentip.css are required, i recommend using grunt to concat and also concat+minify these files to the dist folder on build. i also recommend copying css/img to dist/img on build. i will create a pull request that does this.
