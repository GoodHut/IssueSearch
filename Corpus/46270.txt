 URL : "https://github.com/MadAboutImport/DIFS/issues/6" TITLE : lookup on parent site BODY : hello, i didn't manage to make difs work when uploading items to a sharepoint list having a lookup field associated to a list which is not located in the same web but in a parent web. from my understanding, destinationlistname and lookuplisttitle must be in the same web which is not always the case... did i miss something in the configuration ? thanks!
