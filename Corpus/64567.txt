 URL : "https://github.com/NVIDIA/gpu-rest-engine/issues/21" TITLE : gre output wrong labels BODY : hello, i made my own digits model with googlenet and implemented it in gre, adding the files to docker and changing the dockerfile.caffe_server so that it should use my model-files. after sending one image to gre via curl, it outputs always the same label as the highest-confidence-one, exactly that label that has the first position in the labels.txt . the following confidences are more or less random labels. i already changed the labels.txt to verify this and gre told me the new first label for the exact same image with the exact same percentage. anyone encountered a similar problem and maybe got a solution for this? the same images were identified correctly on digits itself. thanks in advance!
