 URL : "https://github.com/TheMabinogi/Manufactory/issues/58" TITLE : rewrite of facing system BODY : i don't like how confusing the facing system is. i would like a small rewrite to split it into : enumfacing for the direction a block is facing enumside for the side of the block that is being queried currently both of these use enumfacing. nb : the side will transform depending on the facing.
