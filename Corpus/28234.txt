 URL : "https://github.com/sikthehedgehog/indigo/issues/18" TITLE : fix device handling BODY : just implemented the ability to detect any peripheral on any port, but right now it's still kind of quirky and not well tested and this should be fixed before release. namely: indigo doesn't like when two devices of the same kind are present they will constantly run each other . this is kind of a big issue for controllers since having two of them is a very likely situation. detecting a keyboard and a controller at the same time is not reliable - turns out that with the current method, the keyboard ends up passing for a controller whoops! . a better check needs to be implemented to prevent this situation.
