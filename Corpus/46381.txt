 URL : "https://github.com/jeffreykemp/jk64-plugin-reportmap/issues/40" TITLE : make marker draggable BODY : hi jeff, thanks for creating this plug-in. i really like it. and it has got lots of functionality! i was on my way to create the same functionality when i discovered this one. one thing i needed was for markers to be draggable. i keep track of my expenses and use gps to recognize which shop i am in. this is not always accurate, so i want to correct the positions afterward. i took your code and modified it a bit and got the draggable markers. i attach the modified plug-in extension .txt instead of .sql and a word document describing the changes i have made. best wishes, dick dral changes to existing jk64 google maps plugin to add draggable markers.docx https://github.com/jeffreykemp/jk64-plugin-reportmap/files/1389966/changes.to.existing.jk64.google.maps.plugin.to.add.draggable.markers.docx region_type_plugin_com_jk64_report_google_map28422.txt https://github.com/jeffreykemp/jk64-plugin-reportmap/files/1389967/region_type_plugin_com_jk64_report_google_map28422.txt
