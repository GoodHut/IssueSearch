 URL : "https://github.com/lcache/lcache/issues/83" TITLE : improve data serializers. BODY : steps to reproduce an old issue against memcache integration module for drulpal 7 was completed https://www.drupal.org/node/2696129 . expected behavior have the lcache library be as fast and optimal as possible. actual behavior it uses the standard php serializer utilities hardcoded , even though there are better implementations as alternative and compatible extensions - like igbinary. porposed solution add a serialiser utility layer that can abstract that away, so we can have the fastest possible unserialization plush minimalistic storage requirements that will allow switching at any future point with the cost of cache flush. frameworks tested - using lcache/lcache directly
