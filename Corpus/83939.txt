BODY : when ever i add this plugin, my config.xml doesn't seem to work. for example, in my config.xml i disable overscroll glow using the following: <preference name= disallowoverscroll value= true /> if i remove the plugin and rebuild the project everything works and the overscroll glow gets removed, however, when i add this plugin and build the project the overscroll glow comes back. another thing i saw is with my css, i completely remove the scrollbar using: ::-webkit-scrollbar { width: 0px !important; background: transparent !important; / make scrollbar transparent / display: none !important; } but yet again when i add this plugin the scrollbar is visible. any idea on how to fix this?
