 URL : "https://github.com/gnumdk/lollypop/issues/1077" TITLE : smart previous BODY : _this is an enhancement request_ greetings i am not so sure of what this feature is called, but i recall reading it somewhere that it is called “smart previous”. basically, clicking on the previous button places the seek to the start of the song instead of playing the previous song. the next click in a predefined milliseconds will play the previous song. this basically acts as a quick repeat for the same song at least, how i use it . this behaviour exists on gnome music by default. i believe that this may not be the interesting feature for the developer. an additional option to allow this behaviour would be extremely appreciated and be excited upon. all in all, in the end, the choice ends in the hands of the developer. warm regards
