 URL : "https://github.com/omgtransit/omgtransit/issues/5" TITLE : custom docker container BODY : ben, i know you've been dockerizing this app. i like what's been done, but i don't like having to wait a long time for ruby and rails to be installed. i like the idea of being able to reset everything and be back in business in just a few minutes. i use docker in a different manner from most people. for an example of my way of using docker, check out adopt-a-tree https://github.com/opentwincities/adopt-a-tree . i created a custom docker image that includes rbenv, nvm, the specific version of ruby used plus the version we are most likely to upgrade to , the specific versions of rails/pg/nokogiri used plus the versions we are most likely to upgrade to , and other software used. you boot up the docker image, git clone the source code, and then run the build_fast.sh script to set everything up. this takes just a few steps and only a few minutes. i'd like to do something similar here on omgtransit. of course, this will be a bigger endeavor, because adopt-a-tree doesn't involve setting up node, apache, phusion, etc.
