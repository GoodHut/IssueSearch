 URL : "https://github.com/mattn/emmet-vim/issues/379" TITLE : bug when joining tags BODY : hello, i have this: html <button onclick= javascript:console.log date.now % 1000 > 500 >test</button> and joining this tag yields html <button onclick= javascript:console.log date.now % 1000 /> which is obviously invalid html. i fear that it has been implemented with regular expressions which would explain the bad behavior. if it is the case wouldn't it be a better solution to use an xml parser to apply operations on the code ? thank you
