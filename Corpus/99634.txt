 URL : "https://github.com/marmelab/admin-on-rest/issues/476" TITLE : multiselect dropdown input BODY : for a long dropdown list, that could allow multiple values e.g. when filtering - it would be good to provide a multiselect drop down. for instance, similar to the functionality in https://jedwatson.github.io/react-select/ would you see this as a 3rd party component, or something the core should support?
