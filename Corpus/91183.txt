 URL : "https://github.com/RhoInc/Webcharts/issues/119" TITLE : table: simplify data flow BODY : the rarely used config.row_per option routes table data through d3.nest which causes some complications when implementing search and filter. this issue would do one of 2 things: 1 eliminate row_per and just have all table.data sub-objects be standard arrays with one object per tr , or ... 2 rework the data flow so that table.data.nested is created based on row_per at the very end of the data manipulation work flow and can be ignored in most use cases .
