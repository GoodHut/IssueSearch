 URL : "https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/1726" TITLE : how launch multiple vms BODY : newbie question: how to launch multiple vm instances? the doc seems suggesting to use a scale set, but that's overkill also because i would like to spawn a different number of instances for different types, this means i should create many scale set .. . i ideally it should be possible to request a certain number of instances given a vm name.
