 URL : "https://github.com/szarroug3/X-Ray_Calibre_Plugin/issues/99" TITLE : missing cover images BODY : i am using calibre 2.85.1 with the plugin version 3.0.6 on windows 10. after creating/updating the files with the plugin and then sending it to the device, the covers went away. i can fix this by converting the ebooks from epub to epub, but then x-ray is gone again. the only options i changed are the two overwrite options, because the x-ray files didn't seem to get uploaded otherwise.
