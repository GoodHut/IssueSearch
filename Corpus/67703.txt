 URL : "https://github.com/babel/babel-brunch/issues/62" TITLE : publish new npm version BODY : it seems that the package as available on npm is still using babel-preset-latest instead of babel-preset-env , and the readme reflects the same incongruences over at https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-brunch i'm thinking a new npm version should be published so that changes made to the repo 5 months ago? are available on npm.
