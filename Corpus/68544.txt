 URL : "https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/issues/829" TITLE : sc2139 when using $home BODY : for bugs - rule id: sc2139 - my shellcheck version: 0.4.4 - i tried on shellcheck.net and verified that this is still a problem on the latest commit for new checks and feature suggestions - shellcheck.net i.e. the latest commit currently gives no useful warnings about this - i searched through https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/issues and didn't find anything related here's a snippet or screenshot that shows the problem: sh !/usr/bin/env sh alias tree_my_dir= tree $home/my_dir/ here's what shellcheck currently says: sc2139: this expands when defined, not when used. consider escaping. here's what i wanted or expected to see: i don't think that the warning makes sense, since i would not expect $home to change, like for example $pwd. maybe shellcheck could have a whitelist and not trigger the warning if the variable is $home, or are there some scenarios where this warning makes sense?
