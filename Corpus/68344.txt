 URL : "https://github.com/heavenshell/vim-pydocstring/issues/31" TITLE : return type generation? BODY : i was looking at the template multi, apparently there is a line for return type named rtype. the standard doc string is usually :return in python. moreover, it seems i only get :param but not :return or :rtype as in the template . am i missing something here? if not can do a pr for :return generation?
