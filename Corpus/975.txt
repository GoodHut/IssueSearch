 URL : "https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls/issues/810" TITLE : bug in scsv BODY : there seems to be a bug in scsv. since a few weeks probably the grade changes in january , ssl labs no longer reports that my webserver has scsv support. they say it's due to an issue in mbed tls. my bugreport to ssl labs can be found here https://github.com/ssllabs/ssllabs-scan/issues/460 . i already sent this issue to paul, but i heard he's no longer involved in mbed tls development. he said he forwarded the issue to the current developers, but i like to be informed about the progress and hope to receive a patch.
