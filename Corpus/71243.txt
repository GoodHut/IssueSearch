 URL : "https://github.com/Croydon/vertical-tabs-reloaded/issues/127" TITLE : add a tab search feature BODY : there's a chrome extension called quick tab that has a search feature that i'd love to see added to vtr somewhere/somehow. it works like the tab list dropdown, but adds a search field that narrows the list of tabs displayed to just the tabs with titles that match the search text. it's very useful if you have a lot of tabs open and want to find a particular tab quickly without having to scroll through them all reading the titles to find the one you're looking for.
