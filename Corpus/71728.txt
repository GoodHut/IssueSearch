 URL : "https://github.com/africanmathsinitiative/R-Instat/issues/3750" TITLE : adding a new level - bug BODY : using labels/levels, i wanted to add a new level: 1/10 i'm dealing with fractions of 1/10 to 10/10 and at least for now am treating these as factors as this is r's wish. however, if i try to add the level 1/10 or any level with a fraction for that matter! then r-instat automatically makes it 01/10/2017. kudos, r-instat, for using the uk date system. however, these kudos points are retracted since r-instat won't let me put my fraction level in and automatically makes it a factor.
