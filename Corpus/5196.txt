 URL : "https://github.com/silx-kit/silx/issues/1052" TITLE : mca data dtype BODY : when i tried to convert a spec file with mostly mca data, i found that the resulting hdf5 file is 3 times larger than the original spec file. the problem is that i read the mca data into an array of dtype=numpy.double , when the data is integers mostly zeroes and ones . the original c function sfgetmca already stores the data into an array of double . why is that? can mca data be anything else than integers?
