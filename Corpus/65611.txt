 URL : "https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Forum/issues/101" TITLE : ivive workflow in pksim BODY : i recently gave a training and received some user feedback on usability and as far as i remember, this was a topic for almost all trainings : in general it was about scaling/calibrating in vitro results for peff via caco2 for intestinal permeability or intrinsic clearance rates for cyps etc. even though pksim provides all the infrastructure to implement measured in vitro values, it is sometimes hard to understand how my in vitro value should be if at all scaled to be entered for the different calculation methods i can choose from in vitro in presence of microsomes or per g liver biopsy, ... . an additional level of complexity is added when loading relative expression values and defining reference concentrations. so, is there someone in this community with a strong ivive focus and also using pksim who would like to generate / provide a workflow guide and maybe even a set of exercises for self-training for this? ;-
