 URL : "https://github.com/suluke/hfg-particles/issues/58" TITLE : effect set particle count BODY : related: 35 - would be obsolete - i think we can completely remove the particle count inputs and only a default particle count comparable to the default image will remain 49 - could be solved by this. best would be if we could make the effect configuration powerful enough so that the actual particle counts can be dynamically adapted to the current image aspect ratio
