 URL : "https://github.com/waldronlab/MultiAssayExperiment/issues/200" TITLE : add an example dataset BODY : there is complicated code in the examples and vignette for constructing a toy mae, and there is a hnscsample.rds file that depends on the raggedexperiment package. would be nice to have a simple object for examples and testing in the data/ directory, like sample.expressionset in biobase. ideally it would be small but still real enough to get meaningful results from modeling, maybe just hnscsample without the extra dependency.
