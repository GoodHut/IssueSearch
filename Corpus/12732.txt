 URL : "https://github.com/purpleposeidon/Factorization/issues/12" TITLE : repo out of date BODY : hi, i cloned the repo to build a copy that doesn't crash with the latest version of optifine. see: 4 i've got everything working and building successfully but it appears that the repo hasn't been fully updated. the 1.7 branch is missing code from 1.7.10-0.8.108 and possibly more versions back. according to the changelog textfile it hasn't been updated past 1.7.10-0.8.100. any chance the missing code could be added to this repo?
