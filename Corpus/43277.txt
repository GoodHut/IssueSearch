 URL : "https://github.com/den-materials/project-1/issues/23" TITLE : console error message BODY : i have encountered a very strange error that i simply do not know how to handle. the error is: access to image at 'http://img13.deviantart.net/7fc3/i/2012/288/4/7/volt_sprite_sheet_by_kwelfury-d5hx008.png' from origin 'null' has been blocked by cors policy: no 'access-control-allow-origin' header is present on the requested resource. origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access. p5.min.js:31 > p5.js says: it looks like there was a problem loading your image. try checking if the file path http://img13.deviantart.net/7fc3/i/2012/288/4/7/volt_sprite_sheet_by_kwelfury-d5hx008.png is correct, hosting the image online, or running a local server. the only useful resource i found on the subject was https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41965066/access-to-image-from-origin-null-has-been-blocked-by-cors-policy however, as the response details, i have swapped out my file for an online hosted image. yet, the error still remains even after using this hosted file. for reference, the file i am using is a sprite-sheet in my js file to load animation on top of my sprites. function preload { var sprite_sheet = loadspritesheet 'http://img13.deviantart.net/7fc3/i/2012/288/4/7/volt_sprite_sheet_by_kwelfury-d5hx008.png', 171, 158, 10 ; var animation = loadanimation sprite_sheet ; } i am using the p5.play.js library, which is built on-top of canvas.
