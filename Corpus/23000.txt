 URL : "https://github.com/phoemur/ipgetter/issues/22" TITLE : new project altert BODY : @phoemur i just wanted to let you know that i'm using your code in a project i call ipwatch . it uses ipgetter to check the current external ip address of a machine. it compares that value against a saved old ip , and if they differ, dispatches an email to let me know of the change. i use this for keeping track of any ip changes at remote locations. thanks for writing ipgetter. my project is at https://github.com/begleysm/ipwatch
