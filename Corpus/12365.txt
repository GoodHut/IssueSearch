 URL : "https://github.com/fyousufi/prj-rev-bwfs-tea-cozy/issues/2" TITLE : order of classes BODY : i generally like to keep the more important more unique classes to the left since people read left to right. since 'flex-container' is kind of a generic class i would put 'locations' to the left for readability. when scanning a html doc you want the important things to be the easiest to spot. https://github.com/fyousufi/prj-rev-bwfs-tea-cozy/blob/master/teacozys/index.html l47
