BODY : i think this https://github.com/rrdelaney/reasonablytyped/commit/9f987a9161cf9a01e1348ba89303b9dd68005074 commit introduced a number of compiler test failures. not sure of background, but i thought i'd at least register it. since the commit message was stop union types in parameters from generating precode , perhaps the fixtures are just out of date? e.g. duplicate-type-params seems to have dropped: type union_of_number_or_string = | number float | string string; type number_or_string; external number_or_string : union_of_number_or_string => number_or_string = array.prototype.shift.call @@bs.val ;
