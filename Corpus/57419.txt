 URL : "https://github.com/WNPRC-EHR-Services/WNPRC-EHR/issues/25" TITLE : proxy virology imports BODY : using nginx, you can forward imap/pop3 https://www.nginx.com/resources/admin-guide/mail-proxy/ requests to another server. this could be useful for us, because it means we could put another nginx container in our compose config, which would point either to the actual email server hosting the account we want to import virology results from, or we could re-point it to a test server. that would allow us to test the import functionality without touching production's email account. in this scheme, the import code would always look at our proxy, and the proxy would load it's configuration from a .env file.
