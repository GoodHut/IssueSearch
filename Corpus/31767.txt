 URL : "https://github.com/DzeryCZ/Character-LCD-over-I2C/issues/3" TITLE : support for ssd1306 BODY : i was wondering if this would support oled displays, specifically the 128x32 size example https://www.direnc.net/arduino-nano-128x32-oled-lcd-seti-drkit11-20887-89-b.jpg . i would imagine overloading the constructor to something like this: displayi2c lcd = new displayi2c device_i2c_address, i2c_controller_name, scl, sda ; can you tell me if the library can support the aforementioned?
