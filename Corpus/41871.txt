 URL : "https://github.com/OpenMAMA/OpenMAMA/issues/325" TITLE : add openmama to vcpkg BODY : looks like the easiest way to get openmama into nuget may well be to do so via vcpkg https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg . it takes a ports tree approach to build tools and most importantly has an -export option to allow you to upload the results to nuget. definitely worth some investigation. it already has entries for all of our dependencies except for proton, but it's written with cmake in mind so proton would be easily added.
