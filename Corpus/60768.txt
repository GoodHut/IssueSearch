 URL : "https://github.com/InzeNL/InzeUI/issues/2" TITLE : add form input elements BODY : the framework currently doesn't have custom css for form input elements. look at input types and the available attributes for this element. this all includes, but is not limited to, styling the object and checking the input in realtime e.g. checking if a date is really a date . note that not all input types are supported by every browsers. might want to consider just making custom input styles also to override the working input types
