 URL : "https://github.com/publiclab/plotsbot/issues/29" TITLE : add a code of conduct BODY : resolving this issue involves two steps: 1. writing a code of conduct in a file in the root directory of the project preferably named code_of_conduct 2. link the code of conduct to the readme one is not required to write all the code of conduct by oneself. for the most part, content from an existing code of conduct can be borrowed. a few good recommendations would be: 1. publiclab's code of conduct https://publiclab.org/conduct 2. contributor covenant http://contributor-covenant.org/ its a popular code of conduct, major adopters include metasploit, angular, vue, rails, rspec and pretty much the entire ruby/rails ecosystem. @publiclab/soc any suggestions, additions and feedback is welcome.
