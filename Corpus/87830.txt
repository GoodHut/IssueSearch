 URL : "https://github.com/Seddryck/NBi/issues/294" TITLE : matching set - all exists BODY : hi, there is one feature that seems to be lacking and that is where we have set a being compared to set b and that set a resolves to set b but doesn't fail if there are additional set b rows. simple example:- set a 1 2 set b 1 2 3 in this example set a would pass because the data is in the other set. am i missing something?
