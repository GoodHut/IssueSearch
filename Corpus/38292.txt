 URL : "https://github.com/CapsAdmin/pac3/issues/467" TITLE : pac3 permanent trail BODY : i was first trying to add a weapon item when this bug surfaced. i had loaded into a new game and for some odd reason a trail that was meant for the projectile was showing on my character, which was strange considering the item was hidden by hiding the group it was in. i tried clearing my pac to see if it was just a bad pac to no avail, the trail persisted. i tried then restarting my game, and once again, it persisted. then i tried applying a different playermodel and clearing the pac again in the new game. nothing, and once again, it was still there. tl;dr -- a trail in the default position won't come off no matter what i try.
