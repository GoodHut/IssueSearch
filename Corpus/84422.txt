 URL : "https://github.com/josmo/drone-rancher/issues/23" TITLE : custom env variable names BODY : based on drone-secret's documentation i was expecting that i can name my secrets anything i want if i refer to them in my .drone.yml. however, the below snippet presents me with an error: eek: must have url, key, secret, and service definied so my question is: is there a way to use access and secret key names different from rancher_access_key and rancher_secret_key? use case being that different when events would deploy to different rancher environments having different keys along the lines of: rancher_staging: image: peloton/drone-rancher service: my_service url: https://rancher.mycompany.com ... access_key: ${rancher_staging_access_key} secret_key: ${rancher_staging_secret_key} start_first: false when: event: - pull_request secrets: - rancher_staging_access_key - rancher_staging_secret_key
