 URL : "https://github.com/nodesecurity/grunt-nsp/issues/22" TITLE : unable to run in rh6 BODY : hello, i'm trying to run a check on my source code hosted on svn with the grunt module. the check works as expected on my machine win 7 but not on linux server running rh6 , i get this error : info > git-validate@2.2.2 install /var/lib/jenkins_node_slave/workspace/monres_periodic_build_ut_reports_trunk/server/mreseaurs/mreseaurs-appli/src/main/js/node_modules/nsp/node_modules/git-validate info > node bin/install info error warning: unable to find a .git directory for this project, installation aborted. so clearly it has something to do with git-validate dependancy but i can't find anything around it on the net so i came here for help node version is 6.9.0 any help is appreciated. thanks
