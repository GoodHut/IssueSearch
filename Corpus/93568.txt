 URL : "https://github.com/ServUO/ServUO/issues/2676" TITLE : aegis of grace - elf only? BODY : aegis of grace comes in two forms. the circlet which i can see as being elf only and the dragon helm version which is also elf only, but a human graphic? after some research it seems this is incorrect? a human can never equip an aegis of grace? i also can not find any mention to it being elf only to begin with now. if you even do a google search for the images there is no elf only tag. url https://uo.com/wiki/ultima-online-wiki/items/artifacts-minor/ /url url http://www.uoguide.com/aegis_of_grace /url reported by: tasanar report thread: http://servuo.com/threads/aegis-of-grace-elf-only.8262/
