 URL : "https://github.com/airbnb/react-dates/issues/850" TITLE : callback for oncleardates? BODY : i have different options on a dropdown: today , yesterday , custom , etc. - the dropdown flips to become the date-picker holder on the click of 'custom'. - the flip from date-picker back to the dropdown will be handled by customcloseicon by toggling state. i want the date picker to callback my function on cleardates event, i.e. oncleardates could be passed as a prop to the date-picker. accepting a pr for this?
