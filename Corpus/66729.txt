 URL : "https://github.com/LMMS/lmms.io/issues/250" TITLE : new site - footer links BODY : the footer links for the new site should be changed. ! screen shot 2017-10-21 at 10 14 30 am https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6345473/31852621-af6ee438-b648-11e7-9202-409741a3943c.png github - good facebook - good soundcloud - shouldn't link to our service account. we don't publish content there. the live site was changed to https://soundcloud.com/search/sounds?q=%23lmms to load tagged songs, but even that may be a bad idea as our announcement is the first result, which is irrelevant to anything really. youtube - until @cubician takes over our channel and starts publishing content, this link doesn't really have any content. recommend we hide it for now. google+ - remove. on the live site, i've replaced this with a link to discord, which is where most of the chatter is occurring these days.
