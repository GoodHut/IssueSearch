 URL : "https://github.com/EasyinnovaSL/DPFManager/issues/402" TITLE : out of memory-error BODY : while analyzing certain datasets, the program starts to slow down considerably and in the end throws an out-of-memory-error. the program continues to run, but at an excruciatingly slow pace, throwing the same error regularly. - version: dpf manager v3.2 with built-in java virtual machine. called from script as dpf-manager-console.exe - system: windows 8.1 pro x64 | 8,00 gb ram | intel core i7-4770@3,40 ghz - java version of the os not sure if this is relevant : 1.8.0_111 with -xmx1g the error is consistently thrown while analyzing a dataset of 146 gb, consisting of 7871 tiffs and some 2000 other file formats, but has popped up on smaller datasets as wel lowest: 33,4 gb, containing 1117 tiffs . i wonder if this is caused by the maximum heap size of the built-in java set at -xmx512m and if it is possible for a user to change this. thanks in advance
