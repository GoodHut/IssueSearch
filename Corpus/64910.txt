 URL : "https://github.com/firemodels/smv/issues/431" TITLE : hrr not loading in mesh BODY : a more serious issue is that in the effort to speed up the load by not loading hrr or maybe reloading for meshes with hrr under a threshold, somehow we are missing the threshold on occasion. see the attached, you can see the discontinuity, which happens because a mesh block in not loading the hrr. i know how to get around this, but i think it would be good for this to work. thanks. ! screen shot 2017-10-05 at 4 49 58 pm https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4418497/31251929-91769834-a9ed-11e7-9fc3-133c148b904a.png
