 URL : "https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/1847" TITLE : custom retry strategies BODY : a significant amount of gotc failures are due to out of memory / disk errors. design a mechanism that allow to specify custom retry strategies that can modify runtime parameters based on failure modes. for example, “retry on return code x with double the amount of memory and / or disk”. thoughts: - currentattempt wdl function to be used as a variable in a memory / disk formula - monitor the job monitoring script ? to detect disk / memory overflows.
