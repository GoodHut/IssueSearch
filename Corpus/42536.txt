 URL : "https://github.com/oneezy/gtd-trello-card-links/issues/6" TITLE : bogs down the browser BODY : hi, love the idea of this, but i found that on a board with about 50 cards, everything bogged down. the keyboard took 5 to 6 seconds to respond to a key press etc. disabling this extension fixed the problem right away. i'm also use scrum for trello, card color titles for trello, card colors for trello, parent/child management for trello and trello card numbers so it could be a conflict with one of those, if you can't replicate it.
