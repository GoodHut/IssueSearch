 URL : "https://github.com/szagoruyko/wide-residual-networks/issues/39" TITLE : dropout on pytorch BODY : pytorch implementation does not seem to include dropout layer. is there anything special that needs to be considered when adding it? i guess it would be a simple addition between lines 57 and 58 in resnet.py https://github.com/szagoruyko/wide-residual-networks/blob/fde980f/pytorch/resnet.py l57-l58 . from the paper i understood that dropout would improve performance. did i understand correctly, and is that still the case according to your current experience?
