 URL : "https://github.com/cyberhobo/wordpress-geo-mashup/issues/785" TITLE : business view request BODY : not an issue but a request. i would like to see this plugin eventually offer the ability to do google business view. for example i use this for a restaurant directory which has a map but for the header image i would like to pull in the store front address to allow users the ability to see visually what's nearby. currently i have to create a custom map under my maps at google based on the stores address already stored in geo mashup and integrate it directly in to each post. just a friendly request if possible!
