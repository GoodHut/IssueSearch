 URL : "https://github.com/CargoSense/ex_aws/issues/467" TITLE : support for localstack BODY : hi, it'd be great if ex_aws could allow for specification of aws endpoint as is possible in the aws cli , as then our team can use local stack https://localstack.cloud/ which provides a local aws cloud for local development. a potential implementation would be to set the endpoint in the config and thus we can differentiate our dev and a prod config. the endpoint could default point to aws. thanks!
