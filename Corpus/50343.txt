 URL : "https://github.com/CreativeMD/IGCM/issues/24" TITLE : wrong mcmod.info file BODY : i took a look into the mcmod.info file at this repository and the one inside the latest mod version and they are different one. i noticed this cause my self made modpack launcher couldn't detect the mod version. since the gradle files of the project aren't at the repo, i can't take a look into them to see if there goes something wrong. since this isn't a minor issue i would understand if you don't fix it for now.
