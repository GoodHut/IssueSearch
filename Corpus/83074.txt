 URL : "https://github.com/halt-hammerzeit/webpack-react-redux-isomorphic-render-example/issues/25" TITLE : breaks with tree-shaking. BODY : amending babelrc to es2015 , { modules : false } causes builds to fail immediately, complaining about unexpected token import in whatever file is the first to use it as it walks the chain. tried swapping out all imports/exports in all webpack config files to no avail. it just pushes the complaint back further and further.
