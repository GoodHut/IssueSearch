 URL : "https://github.com/valou5940/multi-web-audio-sequencer/issues/4" TITLE : add new tracks BODY : - possibility to add new tracks - how we could implements this : 1. add a new track button in index.ejs and an input with the name of the track 2. in app.js, add a function triggered when click on new track which inserts after the last track the same html code than the previous track. issues => the state must be null in the future it could be interesting to have the choice where the user wants to put the track, or implements a drag n drop 3. we'll have to slightly change toggleselectedlistener and toggleselectedlistenersocket to be dynamic !
