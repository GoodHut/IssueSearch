 URL : "https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/2142" TITLE : tcp metadata propagation BODY : metadata is propagated between client side and server side envoys thru http request headers. source.uid is an example for this meta data. the client side envoy places it in private headers and the server side envoy uses the information to call mixer. we do not have an equivalent mechanism to propagate metadata over a tcp connection. there are several options.
