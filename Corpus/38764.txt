 URL : "https://github.com/krixano/ZeroNet-Dev-Center/issues/15" TITLE : questions edit route BODY : when going directly to the questions edit route, there is a problem where i am not able to access the site_info from the before hook i need to access it to check that the current user is the one who posted the question, if not, i don't let the route resolve - by returning false from the before hook . this is because the before hook is happening before site_info is set. usually this would be fixable by just calling the function that set's site_info before the function that eventually calls the before hook, however this is already the case and it doesn't work because the zeroframe command that set's site_info happens asynchronously - it doesn't wait until it is done before eventually calling the before hook. i could fix this by having the router start init in the callback function from the zeroframe command. however, the routing will lag until the site_info is set only on first load of the zite .
