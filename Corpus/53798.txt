 URL : "https://github.com/GiantToast/language-terraform/issues/30" TITLE : escaping double quotes BODY : it breaks the formatting when escaping double quotes in a string, and the string has a / in it. the resource i'm running into the formatting problem with is a cloudwatch metric filter: hcl resource aws_cloudwatch_log_metric_filter metric-name { name = metricname pattern = { $.key = \ value/ \ } log_group_name = ${aws_cloudwatch_log_group.main.name} metric_transformation { name = metricname namespace = metricnamespace value = 1 } } looks like it may be a bigger formatting problem with hcl, since the github markdown syntax highlighting has the same problem. nevertheless, this is a valid metric filter pattern for aws. and if you try to escape the to fix the formatting, you get the error illegal char escape from terraform.
