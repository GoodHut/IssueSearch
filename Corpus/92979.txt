 URL : "https://github.com/pinax/pinax-stripe/issues/510" TITLE : add a setting for livemode BODY : currently livemode and non-livemode on the same instance is not easy to achieve, since the keys are set on the global stripe module. i could imagine to have a setting pinax_stripe_livemode , which then gets used when validating events - helping to not use the same endpoint/env for both of them.
