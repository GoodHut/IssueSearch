 URL : "https://github.com/ueokande/vim-vixen/issues/56" TITLE : default config suggestion BODY : i'm opening this issue because: - i'll report a bug - x i'll propose a new feature description for users coming from vimfx and probably others , it might be useful to include the following in the default config: x : { type : tabs.close }, x : { type : tabs.reopen }, there may be more, but these were the first that caught me. i was very accustomed to using d/d from my time with vimperator, pentadactyl, etc. but i got used to x/x. now i have both! :-
