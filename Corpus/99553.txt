 URL : "https://github.com/UCSF-HPC/pilot-testing/issues/3" TITLE : mount for software stack s BODY : background the spack https://spack.io package manager build all software from source using rpath to avoic dependency conflicts i.e. such software doesn't rely on ld_library_path being correct . because of this, these software must _not_ be moved after being installed. that is, their installation paths are final. suggestion because of the above, i'd like to settle on a standard directory structure for this already now , but also because it'll be easier for everyone if all software is installed in a well-defined location. note, i'm not talking about system / os-level software. add a mount point /software/ where all site-wide and communal software stacks can reside. with this, site-wide installed software can live directly under this directory, whereas communal once can live under /software/communal/ . different directories can be owned by different groups, but all should be publicly accessible by everyone. for example, /software/spack/ site-wide spack-based software /software/manual/ site-wide manually installed software /software/communal/cbc/ software maintained by cbc at cancer center /software/communal/ihg/ software maintained by ihg /software/communal/johndoe/ software maintained by savvy user /software/ is self explanatory for everyone. an alternative is /apps/ , which is shorter = shorter path s , but a bit less obvious.
