 URL : "https://github.com/mgechev/codelyzer/issues/215" TITLE : warn me when i break aot BODY : hello, i would love if codelyzer could warn me when i do something in my code that will break aot. the current error messages when you try to add aot to an existing app are really cryptic and not useful at all. do you think that codelyzer could check for that? i think that it would make this lib so useful that it would be included in all angular apps :- let's start a list of the things that break aot to see what could be checked correct me if i'm wrong : - private / protected properties used in templates - using external values insides string templates with ${...} instead of class properties - using require instead of import to load angular code that uses decorators, or to load template/styles - not exporting interfaces / types even if you don't use them outside of the current file - using export default for ng modules - using form.controls.controlname instead of form.get 'controlname' - using control.errors?.someerror instead of control.haserror ‘someerror’ - using functions in decorators especially routes / ng modules instead of using the reference to an exported function - using external angular libs that don't include .metadata.json files do you know of any other things that break aot? do you think you could check for some of most of these?
