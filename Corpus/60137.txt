 URL : "https://github.com/cimichaelm/python3-secureconfig/issues/2" TITLE : why is this abandoned? BODY : i don't mean that @cimichaelm has some obligation to be a maintainer. nor does @nthmost the original developer https://bitbucket.org/nthmost/python-secureconfig but the need for a module like this is clear https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33964024/most-secure-storage-username-password-config-file-python https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7014953/i-need-to-securely-store-a-username-and-password-in-python-what-are-my-options https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12042724/securely-storing-passwords-for-use-in-python-script and there is a clear benefit in having an interface that matches https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html instead of handrolling as suggested by the stackoverflow responses but this module seems to be quite different, at the moment i'm bumping into the use of configobj.get section, key, default='foo' secureconfig vs configobj.get section, key, fallback='foo' configparser yet somehow this seems to have virtually no users. maybe this just fell through the gaps during the py2 vs py3 transition, but if so i'd expect at least the py2 version to still have some users, but there is no evidence of that. i have my own fork, and i can add the support for fallback, but i have to wonder if i'm missing some reason why this is so neglected. it is not secure? is there some better approach that is used instead?
