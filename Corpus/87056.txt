 URL : "https://github.com/drsimonj/twidlr/issues/1" TITLE : introduce predict methods BODY : this is a broad idea: for each model exposed by twidlr, add corresponding predict methods to tidy up this interface too. e.g., predict object = twidlr-fitted-model, data = data.frame, ... or reverse order of data and object? some thoughts... - when a model is fit using a twidlr function, append a unique class to it e.g., paste twidlr_ to primary class . - extend predict.twidlr_ to take a twidlr-fitted model, a data frame at least including all relevant variables , and additional arguments, and return predicted values. however, will have to decide whether this extended predict takes the data frame or fitted model object first. - to ensure that the data frame can be translated into data necessary for predict to work, store the formula used by twidlr model as an attribute of the fitted object. this can then be used by model_as_xy to reconstruct whatever variables are needed to make the prediction.
