 URL : "https://github.com/live-composer/live-composer-page-builder/issues/761" TITLE : content duplication issue BODY : 28612, 28220 wp keeps creating pages named like some image in the media gallery, worst thing is that it keeps duplicating itself. for example i have 10 pages created, but after a while i have more than 40 pages all of them pointing to a media file. in few minutes of work i have 30/40 pages more and it's really probable i delete some i need because they have all the same names.
