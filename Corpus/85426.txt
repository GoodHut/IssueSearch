 URL : "https://github.com/fhir-crucible/crucible/issues/269" TITLE : extremely large responses BODY : crucible currently does not save extremely large server responses to the database due to mongo limitations. however, it does not consider the size of entire test runs, where each individual test is below the size limit, but taken together they exceed the size limitations. this line causes the error: https://github.com/fhir-crucible/crucible/blob/de2854124dce802692c2bb402371761b3d953269/app/models/test_run.rb l146
