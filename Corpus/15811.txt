 URL : "https://github.com/SOCR/SOCRAT-issues/issues/150" TITLE : fix worldbank api BODY : we need to fix wordbank api and add few more options for dataset. so far i was using 2000 cells as a soft limit for dataset size to allow clustering/bootstrapping â€“ so number of record to retrieve can be calculated as 2000/ cols. however, user can get more records and then socrat will suggest to uniformly subsample rows. subtasks: - fix education spending - fix out-of-school children rate - add few more datasets up to 10-15 - fix styling of controls: inputs, dropdowns we're using flatui https://designmodo.github.io/flat-ui/docs/components.html
