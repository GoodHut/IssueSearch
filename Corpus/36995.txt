 URL : "https://github.com/ScriptTiger/Hosts-Packages/issues/1" TITLE : is this repo useful? BODY : the purpose of this repo is to continue supporting .zip files in an isolated repo separate from steven black's repo so the .zip file blob history can easily be managed without affecting the rest of the project. as a secondary objective, it also comes with crlf line endings which are more universal to text editors/viewers to make things easier for some users. termination notice this repo will be discontinued if there is no need for it. if you find it helpful, just drop a comment here. otherwise, if things stay quiet, i'll assume it's unnecessary and drop this project. this repo does not take any extra time or effort on my part to maintain and it's continuance is based solely on the community need. so please don't feel guilty in anyway, and if you truly find it helpful please let me know.
