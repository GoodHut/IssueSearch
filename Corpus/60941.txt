 URL : "https://github.com/Pathoschild/SMAPI/issues/215" TITLE : add save-related events BODY : create saveevents with three events: event | description ----- | ----------- beforesave | raised just before the game serialises data to the save file. aftersave | raised just after the game serialises data to the save file. | afterload | raised after player loads a saved game. this deprecates playerevents.loadedgame , which is often confused with gameevents.gameloaded . this is an oft-requested feature, e.g. for mods that create custom content that can't be serialised to the save file.
