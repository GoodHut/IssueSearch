 URL : "https://github.com/Morgan-Stanley/hobbes/issues/74" TITLE : non-unix systems port? BODY : hello! first of all thank you for open-sourcing hobbes, i just stumbled upon it and it looks great! i'd be interested in contributing a win32 port if you are interested. for this, i have the following thoughts: a first coarse review of the code shows you're relying on mman and unix sockets, epoll & kevent respectively. for a win32 port, these should be easily replaced with virtualalloc, mapviewoffile et al, winsock2 and waitformultipleobjects, modulo some worker threads for tasks that don't map 1:1 to the epoll semantics. but, seeing that this would not be the first cross-platform project that needs async io, timers and http , i can't help but think of using a library like libuv to avoid having to maintain this sort of cross-platform code with all unexpected caveats . i suppose avoiding this sort of maintenance burden would be in the interest of morgan stanley, too. as i'm writing this, i'm reminded that llvm should also contain the odd cross-platform abstraction for some of these topics, if not all after all clang's static analyzer includes an http server as well, though i haven't checked the code so far . so... may i get my hands dirty at this? cheers!
