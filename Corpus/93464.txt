 URL : "https://github.com/phetsims/scenery/issues/667" TITLE : add tostateobject to tnode BODY : this came up while discussing how to implement https://github.com/phetsims/axon/issues/137 with @samreid. this issue is part of a larger task to improve the way the tostateobject and fromstateobject are used across phet-io. this will increase the size of the state objects for the state wrapper , but it will also allow us to have the metadata about the node potentially from the wrapper easier, without many async calls to query properties like 'visible' and 'pickable'.
