 URL : "https://github.com/marktnoonan/marta-mobility-component/issues/1" TITLE : various booking issues BODY : bookings with the following statuses cause some weirdness in the data being returned from the api: - cancelled in advance - cancelled late - no show - cancelled customer error also, bookings that have no van scheduled yet seem to give inconsistent results. within the trapeze system they have a start window but not a ready time ... so we should make sure we are always referring to the start window value as the ready time on our end, and only use the ready time to generate the eta. we need to either have the scraping capture and report all these trips, and handle them on the front end. or decide, on the back end, which trips are worth keeping and which are not.
