 URL : "https://github.com/DistributedTeam/MongoDB/issues/4" TITLE : chapter 11 : replication BODY : in mongodb a replica set is made up of a primary node and a number of secondary or arbiter nodes. in replica set terms, a primary is the source of truth at a given moment for your replica set. _it is the only node in the set to which data can be directly written to via your application and from which all other nodes ultimately replicate this data._ a secondary member is a data-carrying nonprimary member, which can barring a few exceptions theoretically become a primary. ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13977235/31853762-d8099992-b6c0-11e7-8520-597fafb83544.png
