 URL : "https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android/issues/570" TITLE : apollo store as submodule BODY : proposal: extract apollo store as separate submodule motivation: apollo store became mature and independent thing with own imperative api, we should consider to move it to separate submodule, so apollo-runtime will be pure for making network calls, apollo-store pure for storing response data. and it will be optional for user in case if he needs only pure network layer.
