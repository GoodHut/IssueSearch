 URL : "https://github.com/Zrips/Residence/issues/15" TITLE : fire isue little bug BODY : when you protect from the spread of fire and ignite with a lighter some slabs of wood, a strange bug occurs when you want to turn it off and then break the block where the fire was. it tells you that you do not have permissions to build and will not let you break the block. but if you put another block anywhere else away from that ultraprotected block where the fire was. the bug disappears.
