 URL : "https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_os/issues/1347" TITLE : physical memory and cache BODY : hi, i am writing some driver in optee that i need to allocate a memory block which is physically continuous. what api i should use? the design doc mentioned something about mobj_phys_alloc but i cannot find that api, is it out of date? also, the reason why i need this memory is to let dma to use it. after cpu writes to it, what api should i use to flush the cache so dma can pickup the data correctly? and vice versa? or is it possible for me to mark a dynamically allocated memory area as non-cached? thanks a lot!
