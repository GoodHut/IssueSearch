 URL : "https://github.com/rbuckton/proposal-throw-expressions/issues/5" TITLE : question return value? BODY : hey. this proposal is almost looks good for ecmascript. but i have question about return value of throw expression that cached by try-catch statement. e.g. javascript let thrownvalue = null; try { thrownvalue = throw new error 'error' ; } catch e { // thrownvalue === null? } in above case, thrownvalue become null or other intermediate value?
