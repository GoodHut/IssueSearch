 URL : "https://github.com/stedolan/jq/issues/1450" TITLE : extending some builtins BODY : i'm using the following filters in my code: not/1: complement for empty and identity filters def not stream : if isempty stream then . else empty end ; length/1: produces length for finite streams def length stream : reduce stream as $_ 0; .+1 ; i kown this can be a dangerous practice because jq developers perhaps have future plans for __not/1__ and __length/1__&hellip; what if my definitions are accepted as new builtins? they do not polute the global namespace... jjor
