 URL : "https://github.com/root-project/rootspi/issues/25" TITLE : root docker group id BODY : when using the root docker container, i get $ docker run -it rootproject/root-ubuntu16 bash groups: cannot find name for group id 2735 sftnight@99a7747425dd:/$ the output of id : uid=14806 sftnight gid=2735 groups=2735 and that group is not listed in /etc/group . besides the warning, it might be causing some issues when i'm making a new dockerfile using this as the base image and then using cmake it can't make some files inside the build directory .
