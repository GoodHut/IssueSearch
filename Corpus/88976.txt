 URL : "https://github.com/osuosl/streamwebs/issues/505" TITLE : pebble count data missing BODY : i discovered that we haven't implemented pebble count data into the application. there seems to be about 32 data entries for this data type like this one: http://drupal.streamwebs.org/data/pebble-count/west-olalla-creek/04-14-2017. i'm not sure whether this was intentional or on the to do list. here is what the input form looks like: http://drupal.streamwebs.org/node/add/data-pebble-count @rensmere any insight on this? does it need to be implemented?
