 URL : "https://github.com/webheroesinc/restruct/issues/1" TITLE : re-design command api BODY : the restruct api should be re-designed so that an object will remain untouched if there are no restruct commands in it. for example, the command value true tells restruct to extract the value based on the key string. the only way to get a raw value of true would be = true . the same goes for any integers, which makes this a very intrusive design. furthermore, we should try and minimize the number of different commands there are.
