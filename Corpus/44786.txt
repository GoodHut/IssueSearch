 URL : "https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost-CLI/issues/170" TITLE : fix update command ux BODY : noticed this when fixing 168 -> there's some odd behavior that's going on with the update command when you pass the --rollback or --force options, or when an version folder already exists. also, if there are no versions available for ghost update to install, a more sensible error should be output.
