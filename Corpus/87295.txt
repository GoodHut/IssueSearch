 URL : "https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/buildfarm_deployment/issues/159" TITLE : keep an eye on hhh-docker BODY : there's an attempt to fork and maintain the docker puppet module we're using to https://github.com/hackerhappyhour/hackerhappyhour-docker the issue that most affects us at the moment is the outdated repository url, which is surmountable without updated but if the community moves to this fork i think it's sensible to follow. the maintenance / release request issue: https://github.com/garethr/garethr-docker/issues/699 as ever, thanks to the authors and maintainers past, present, and future, of these modules. we'd all be in a rough state without your contributions!
