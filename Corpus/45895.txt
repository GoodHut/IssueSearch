 URL : "https://github.com/joezcool02/OurCalculator/issues/58" TITLE : issue 19: minor fixes BODY : - calculator division: division returns a float, and often it's too big for the display. an easy fix for this is to recast it, but maybe increase display? or shrink text? gui.expression.append answer instanceof double ? double answer .floatvalue :answer ; - calculator appends new input to the old: ie sequence 5.+.5.=.1.2 = 1012 - add brackets and decimal - i think this might be as simple as adding buttons, at the moment i can't think of any reason an invalid bracket syntax would pass to the display.
