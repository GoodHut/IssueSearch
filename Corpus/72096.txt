 URL : "https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-app/issues/584" TITLE : autoplay feature request BODY : the issue steps to reproduce 1. open a claim video / music maybe images and gifs too . 2. click on play / open. 3. wait for the content... expected behaviour there should be an option in settings to toggle this feature: i open a claim and then the video starts playing no need to wait or click to play, same for images or gifs and music. content already downloaded / purchased, obviously ^^ also if i left before a video ends, it should trigger autoplay but: > the video should pick up where it left off e.g. starting at 03:55, instead of at 00:00 actual behaviour nothing, there isn't an autoplay feature :stuck_out_tongue: anything else i think this also need in other issues ,so i'm connecting: https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-app/issues/491, https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-app/issues/579
