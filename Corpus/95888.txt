 URL : "https://github.com/pycalphad/pycalphad/issues/139" TITLE : documentation nits for 0.6 BODY : due to a more complicated upstream packaging environment and new dependencies in 0.6, users are more likely than ever to encounter snags when trying to install and use pycalphad. since upstream patches take a while to make it through a largely volunteer-driven qa process, the best thing we can do is try to mitigate the issue in our installation instructions. below is a list of issues users are likely to encounter, and the corresponding workaround. these need to make it into the documentation with the release of 0.6. - problem during calculation : typeerror: argument is not an mpz - solution : once sympy/sympy 13530 is merged and released, users should update sympy. until then, users can remove the gmpy2 package from their python environment to fix the issue. alternatively, users can set the environment variable mpmath_nogmpy to a non-zero value. - problem during installation via pip : src/cyipopt.c:239:29: fatal error: ipstdcinterface.h: no such file or directory - solution : the library ipopt is a new dependency in pycalphad 0.6 and requires installation of an external library not available on pypi. this error message means ipopt is either not installed or not in your path. ipopt installation instructions are available at https://www.coin-or.org/ipopt/documentation/node10.html - however, users especially users on windows are strongly encouraged to use the anaconda installation instructions for pycalphad instead. conda install pycalphad and conda update pycalphad will automatically install ipopt on all platforms. @bocklund we need to wrap up what you started in https://github.com/pycalphad/pycalphad/commit/b67675fad68364224931eea5d7e91fbaaa0a44e3 and include the feedback from 126
