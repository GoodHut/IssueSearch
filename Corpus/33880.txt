 URL : "https://github.com/eurofurence/ef-app_android/issues/125" TITLE : back button behavior BODY : 2.0.6 the back button behaves inconsistenly throughout the application. in some views event detail, dealer detail , it navigates 'back' properly, in others e.g private messages, or login form , it exits out of the application. i assume that's due to the nature of those windows/fragments. my recommendation, to improve the user experience in a quick way, would be the hook into the back button if possible , and - if whenever the back button is pressed and would exit the application, i would redirect the user to the home screen, and only __there__ let them exit out of the application by using the back button. not sure if that' s doable easily, though.
