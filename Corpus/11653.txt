 URL : "https://github.com/camsaul/django-rest-params/issues/1" TITLE : integers in list BODY : when i try to use integers in list, like page_size= 10, 20, 50, 100 , django-rest-params compares it as string and throws an error. is there any way to send a list/tuple of integers and specify that the param takes only integer? right now type of list assumes that it is of str type. the work around i'm using right now is page_size= 10 , 20 , 50 , 100 defining the list as strings and type casting it in the view. it would be nice if we can specify the type of items in the list.
