BODY : found an issue or bug? tell me all about! it's not an issues it's more of a question as i am quite new to vuejs. describe the issue / bug. i am struggling to figure out how to change views? so i created a view in: app/src/renderer/routes.js like so: { path: '/test', name: 'test', component: require 'components/testview' }, i then created the testview component the exact same way as the landingpageview. swapped all the code to match the correct component it is. now i have no way of changing page? i can't use something like window.location? is there a file i need to create to enable this? what am i missing exactly to allow me to have more than one page? how can i reproduce this problem? explained above. if visual, provide a screenshot. ! screen shot 2017-06-01 at 17 35 35 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5339861/26690343/d51f98de-46f0-11e7-9f30-b336434d660d.png tell me about your development environment. node version: v7.10.0 npm version: 4.2.0 vue-cli version: 2.8.2 operating system: mac os x el capitan
