 URL : "https://github.com/RecastAI/Recast.AI/issues/15" TITLE : post issue in /gazettes BODY : when creating a gazette right after creating an entity throws http 400 with a message entity is not present in the bot . i have created an entity with the payload: {name: info-report } and it returns me the following response: { results :{ id :5072, name : info-report , slug : info-report , color : 29b6f6 , custom :true, count :1}, message : entity created with success } then i tried to create a gazette with the following: {entity_id: info-report , is_open: true} which throws http 400 with the following response: { results :null, message : entity is not present in the bot } it seems it requires a certain delay between creating an entity and a gazette based on it?
