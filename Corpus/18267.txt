 URL : "https://github.com/beville/ComicStreamer/issues/47" TITLE : stuck on scanning BODY : i recently deleted a series of about 27 issues. i noticed that chunky still showed the issues, as well as didn't show my new series'. looking at comic streamer, it's scanning. the logs say it's removing the series' issues, but this is after multiple restarts and shutdowns. i even cleared out the cs folder, and did a new git clone. i don't know where the db is stored, or i'd wipe it to and start fresh. any ideas?
