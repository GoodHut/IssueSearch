 URL : "https://github.com/typestyle/csstips/issues/8" TITLE : use harmony imports BODY : change from import as types from typestyle/lib/types to import types from typestyle/lib/types webpack3 has a module concatenation plugin which relies on using harmony imports. i understand this won't work just by changing imports, but if you enable allowsyntheticdefaultimports https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html it'll work. i can create a pr if you're interested. :slightly_smiling_face:
