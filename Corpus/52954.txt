 URL : "https://github.com/AngleSharp/AngleSharp.Css/issues/9" TITLE : css value normalizing? BODY : i realize the devel branch is basically alpha, so this is a is this the behavior going forward? type of question. basically, i'm curious if it's intentional that values such as background: 0 or color: black become background: left and color: rgba 0, 0, 0, 1 , respectively. the end result is functionally equivalent, but given that, is there a reason to convert the source value? i can understand splitting the anglesharp project into separate projects, but my expectation was that the output would be the same in anglesharp.css as it is currently in the combined project. for reference, this question originates from this issue in htmlsanitzer: https://github.com/mganss/htmlsanitizer/issues/117.
