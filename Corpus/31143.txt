 URL : "https://github.com/django/daphne/issues/118" TITLE : runtime metrics api BODY : it would be nice if daphne could provide an api for runtime metrics for things like messages/active connections. i imagine this could be built from 2 api's, one providing a basic http api we could hit and get the current active number of connections in our case websocket for that daphne instance. secondly a plugin/interface we could hook into to emit runtime events, we'd like to emit statsd events for connections opened/messages sent/closed etc, but i would imagine there are other metric systems people would use, so a generic stats interface / plugin system would be better than embedding statsd into daphne directly.
