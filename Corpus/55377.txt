 URL : "https://github.com/NLeSC/Xenon/issues/600" TITLE : integration tests slow BODY : in the last week or two i've seen a significant slowdown of the integration tests. for example, just running the slurm14 test already takes over 20 minutes for only 34 tests. looking at the test results, even a simple test_isembedded takes 52 seconds, while this only creates an object and returns a hard coded boolean.... i'm not sure if this is an issue with my system, if some dependency is broken, or ... will investigate further.
