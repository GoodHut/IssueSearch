 URL : "https://github.com/appveyor/ci/issues/1550" TITLE : artifact name with spaces BODY : discussion http://help.appveyor.com/discussions/questions/3823-deploying-to-github-releases problem is probably because in deployment we allow list of artifact delimited with comma, semicolon and spaces. we can remove spaces from legitimate delimiters, though not sure if many exiting deployment will be broken. or we can disallow spaces in deployment name. it seems that spaces in name are much more common and natural that space-delimited list, so first option looks better.
