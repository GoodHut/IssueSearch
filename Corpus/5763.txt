 URL : "https://github.com/trustlines-network/clientlib/issues/25" TITLE : split up tests BODY : we should split up the tests in at least normal tests and e2e test, where the e2e tests need a running relay server and the normal tests not. even better would be to have unit, integration and e2e, where unit only tests small parts of the code and are fast and short, integration tests the integration of the code with other parts of the code and also external code, so for example together with eth-lightwallet.
