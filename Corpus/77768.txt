 URL : "https://github.com/angular/flex-layout/issues/96" TITLE : npm repo version problem BODY : i'm having some dependency problems trying using flex-layout with my project. in last angular blog post, which announced material beta release, it was stated that flex-layout was also available for angular 2.4.0+. i'm using angular 2.4.1, however when trying to install flex-layout with: npm install @angular/flex-layout which fails because of dependency issue saying that angular ~2.2.3 is required. that's fine, but it doesn't corresponds to what the blog post stated, neither to current master package.json angular version. i also tried by the way, to install it with npm install https://github.com/angular/flex-layout-builds.git to have latest change from master, but still, it says it requires angular ~2.2.3. npm view @angular/flex-layout also shows peerdependency at angular ~2.2.3. also i saw some closed issues where people managed to use flex-layout with angular 2.3.0 which doesn't match ~2.2.3 , so i apologize for the useless issue if the problem comes from my bad understanding, but i think that it is a real issue.
