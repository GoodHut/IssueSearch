 URL : "https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ScriptableRenderLoop/issues/385" TITLE : global shader variables BODY : so... 1 question and 1 request: what's the status of rendersettings and srp? are ambient color fog settings etc still set? i have a weird bug where ambient light color is not the same when i enable srp. it's also not the same in game and scene view! btw, i see that the unity_lightmodel_ambient macro returns glstate_lightmodel_ambient... why is ambient a glstate and not just a global constant? feels like a leftover of fixed function pipeline...? when are global constants set? can we set them ourselves? in the interest of full scriptableness, it would seem fit that we can set everything ourselves, with obviously easy defaults: rendercontext.setdefaultglobals ; but we could also do: var globalcmd = new commandbuffer ; globalcmd.name = custom globals ; globalcmd.setglobalfloat _time , time.time ; globalcmd.setglobalcolor unity_ambientsky , color.magenta ; ... rendercontext.executecommandbuffer globalcmd ; globalcmd.release ;
