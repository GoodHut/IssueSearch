 URL : "https://github.com/pioneers/PieCentral/issues/370" TITLE : hibike batch writes BODY : currently, hibike batches device reads, but device writes are always sent immediately. since device reads gave a good improvement in latency, it might be worth investigating whether batched writes will delver a similar improvement. i think this might be a good issue for a new member, and i am willing to mentor them.
