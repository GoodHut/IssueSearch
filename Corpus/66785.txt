 URL : "https://github.com/Hennamann/Live-Chat-Question-Flagger/issues/12" TITLE : no display of questions BODY : as of 8c1e44007b06de5895e733ce2436885751e7159d, attempting to click the ? in the ui causes no questions to appear on the right hand side. the ui doesn't appear to match what is displayed in the screenshots at all: it appears that the split screen with the questions view in modview.html is not actually what is checked in? any chance you may have a slightly out of date ui checked in for modview.html, or something obvious i'm missing in the setup? the source html doesn't appear to have any handling for displaying questions selected...
