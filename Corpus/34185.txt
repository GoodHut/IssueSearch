 URL : "https://github.com/mrclay/minify/issues/569" TITLE : caching by base path BODY : i suggest to vary cached css files by 'b' get parameter. in \min\lib\minify.php _getcacheid function add something like , array_key_exists 'b', $_get ? $_get 'b' : '' to the array being serialized. this is needed when the same application can be accessed with and without a subdirectory in path using subdomain vs subdirectory . in such case, the base path 'b' parameter changes but the files 'f' parameter are the same. without varying the cache by base path, minifier generates and caches the files using the base path which was used to access the site first time and would incorrectly serve that version for both urls. it breaks url's of images and fonts in the css files.
