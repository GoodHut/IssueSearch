 URL : "https://github.com/CalderaWP/Caldera-Forms/issues/1770" TITLE : total value 0 in emails BODY : caldera forms version: 1.5.2.1 php version: 7.0.21 expected behaviour --------------------- total amount in email should show actual, non-zero, value. problem description --------------------- my form has a set of checkboxes, all of which have their label, value and calculation value set. the label and value are text strings service name . the calculation value is set to a number price of the service . calculations on front-end work perfectly but when the form gets submited, i receive email, showing which service has been selected but shows total as 0. i use {summary} to display the form's content. changing the checkbox's value in the form to the actual price solved the problem, and the total did show a correct amount, but the service name in the email was replaced with the value. ideally, i should see a service name stored in value and the total should show an actual amount based on the calculation values.
