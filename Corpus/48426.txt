 URL : "https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/7354" TITLE : sankey / skip columns BODY : hi, it's very often needed to skip columns in a sankey chart to get better visibility of the different links, respectively to better use the available space. i've done a few workarounds to get close to that function - for that i've inserted a dummy-node with the same width and color of the previous node and removed the datalabel. but it's still not a very elegant solution, even because there is a unnecessary dummy-rectangle visible. here you can see my workaround - the final solution should be, that 1 moves to 2 an replaces it. ! grafik https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32926274/32392187-d913ad64-c0d4-11e7-93f4-3ea491521f1d.png it would be nice to declare the amount of columns to skip in the data-array like: data: {from:'a', to: 'b', weight: 5}, {from:'c', to: 'd', weight: 3}, {from:'e', to: 'f', weight: 4, skipcolumns: 2}, //should skip two columns {from:'g', to: 'h', weight: 2} {from:'h', to: 'i', weight: 3} {from:'i', to: 'f', weight: 3}
