 URL : "https://github.com/StrangeLoopGames/EcoIssues/issues/2092" TITLE : ability to trash items BODY : we need an option to throw away items in inventory. e.g. if you created a lot of skill scrolls but need space, i want to throw them away instead of creating more storage chest to store them. this issue is not a implementation of a trash bin object its for an ui implementation.
