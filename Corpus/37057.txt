 URL : "https://github.com/lwjglgamedev/lwjglbook/issues/45" TITLE : java 9 compatibility BODY : hey, it seems that the code is not working properly anymore with the new java 9 version. they seem to have changed the behaviour of input-streams, so that compiling the input of the shader-files will throw an npe under java 9. java 8 still works fine though. is there any chance of an update on this?
