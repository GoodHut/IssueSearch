 URL : "https://github.com/Zirro/css-object-model/issues/6" TITLE : achieve parity with cssom BODY : the cssom https://github.com/nv/cssom package includes basic support for several interfaces, but only medialist seems to offer methods we still need to implement for parity. we should also add initialization of cssimportrule , csskeyframerule , csskeyframesrule through the parser. it is worth noting that cssom also supports cssdocumentrule , csshostrule , cssvalue and cssvalueexpression interfaces. these are either experimental or deprecated and see little use, so i believe we can leave them unimplemented.
