 URL : "https://github.com/winder/Universal-G-Code-Sender/issues/587" TITLE : 2.0 or platform? BODY : this isn't actually and issue but a question. please let me know if there is a more appropriate venue for this sort of query. i've played with 1.0.9 and 2.0 and platform. i really like 2.0 best of the three but i'd like to know in what direction most of the development effort is headed. to the casual observer, things seem to be headed toward platform. or, are they being developed in parallel and will keep a roughly even level of maturity?
