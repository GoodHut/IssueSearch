 URL : "https://github.com/stedolan/mlsub/issues/2" TITLE : type union position BODY : is there a description on why mlsub chooses {x: t1|t2, y: t3|t4} over {x:t1,y:t3}|{x:t2,y:t4} when computing a type union of {x:t1,y:t3} and {x:t2,y:t4}? i understand that both typings are technically correct but want to know whether it is possible to steer the computation so it would produce the second option union of records instead of record of unions
