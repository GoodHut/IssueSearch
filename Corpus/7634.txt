 URL : "https://github.com/mozilla/web-ext/issues/1043" TITLE : how to get url? BODY : is this a feature request or a bug? feature request what is the current behavior? when i run web-ext build and then load that folder into a firefox browser with xpinstall.signatures.required set to false it is accessible at some url moz-extension://<uuid> . the uuid is, as far as i can tell, randomly generated anew for each profile. what is the expected or desired behavior? i want to be able to make this uuid consistent. i am running selenium tests against my extension and need to have a way of getting it's url so that i can navigate to it. i am using the selenium-webdriver package to create a firefox profile and add an extension: javascript const firefox = require 'selenium-webdriver/firefox' ; var profile = new firefox.profile ; profile.addextension '/dist/dist/' ; profile.setpreference 'xpinstall.signatures.required', false ; it looks like, from this issue https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1271663 , that there might be a way to make the id constant currently, but i cannot figure out how. in my manifest.json i am setting the id like this: json { applications : { gecko : { id : passit@passit.io , but that is not used in the url to access the extension. version information for bug reports firefox version : 56.0b2 your os and version : ubuntu 16.04 paste the output of these commands: bash $ node --version && npm --version && web-ext --version v6.11.1 3.10.10 1.10.1 using firefox from docker image registry.gitlab.com/passit/docker-selenium built from this repo https://gitlab.com/passit/docker-selenium .
