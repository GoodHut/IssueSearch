 URL : "https://github.com/juju-solutions/layer-cwr/issues/73" TITLE : add proxy support BODY : cwr needs to add proxy support if it wants to support flexible lab deployments. i needed to add: http_proxy https_proxy no_proxy variables/proxy config to the following menu items in jenkins to install required plugins and run tests: http://jenkins:8080/configure environment variables http://jenkins:8080/pluginmanager/advanced ideally the charm should just read the 'http_ ', 'no_proxy' environment variables setup by juju and adjust jenkins automatically without user intervention. this could be punted as a jenkins charm issue but i'm filing it here to track.
