 URL : "https://github.com/cemerick/pomegranate/issues/82" TITLE : please tag 0.3.1 release BODY : would it be possible for you to tag the 0.3.1 release? github appears to be missing it. commit: https://github.com/cemerick/pomegranate/commit/ba0a76f79122f0c7668e8b84b2dc0e74bea1e03b this would be helpful as i am attempting to upgrade the version of this package uploaded to debian for facilitating the packaging of leiningen 2, and the current packaging relies on original tarballs being available.
