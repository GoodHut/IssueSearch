 URL : "https://github.com/clue/php-redis-react/issues/67" TITLE : client interface methods BODY : i've been working with react php for a few weeks now and since today i'm trying out this package. so far it seems to work fine but i'm missing a few methods inside the client interface, such as: subscribe , publish , get and set . i don't know if this was intentional but i would like to see it sometime in the future.
