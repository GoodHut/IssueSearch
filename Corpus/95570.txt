 URL : "https://github.com/lago-project/lago/issues/429" TITLE : define ansible role per vm BODY : when https://github.com/lago-project/lago/pull/428 gets in, it will deduce the vm ansible role from the vm-type, this might be good for ovirtlago, but would enforce creating a vm plugin per role. i suggest to add to the vm metadata a 'role' parameter, for example: yaml dom1: .... metadata: role: httpd the role would default to the vm type if not defined. i'm familiar enough with ansible requirements, maybe it should be 'ansible' specific? for instance: yaml dom1: .... metadata: .... ansible: role: ... other ansible metadata params ... some relevant past issue/work done by @ehelms : https://github.com/lago-project/lago/issues/281
