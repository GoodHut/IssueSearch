 URL : "https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate/issues/737" TITLE : clarify placeholder props BODY : hi @ianstormtaylor! in the placeholder docs https://docs.slatejs.org/reference/components/placeholder.html , we have two props: node and parent . my understanding based on the docs is that the former is used to determine what to render and position on the top of, and the latter to determine the node whose content triggers the placeholder . i imagine they are usually the same. i ask because with that assumption, the placeholder doesnâ€™t render. jsx //in the node being rendered <div {...attributes}> <placeholder node = {node} parent = {node} state = {state} > {placeholdertext} </placeholder> {children} </div> it fails in the isvisible function here - https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate/blob/master/src/components/placeholder.js l55 so, i am not sure what to pass as the node prop. the text node of the node for which it is a placeholder? alternatively, i feel this is a place where the firstonly prop that you referred to https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate/issues/66 issue-164915571 can be used. i'm happy to make a pr that checks for the line linked above in isvisible only if firstonly is set to true. thoughts?
