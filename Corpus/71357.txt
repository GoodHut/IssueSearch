 URL : "https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/29853" TITLE : add defattr for copy/add BODY : originally proposed here: https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/28499 issuecomment-270050669 i'm also proposing defattr so that if you use multiple copy or add you don't have to repeat the options: defattr chown=user defattr chown=user:group defattr chown=uid defattr chown=uid:gid chmod is a bit tricky because you definetely want different permissions for files and dirs: defattr chmod=a+rx defattr chmod=a+x these would rise the x bit only if x bit is present for any of the users: chmod 1 : > execute/search only if the file is a directory or already has execute permission for some user x or more clearer directives for different kinds: defattr dir_chmod=0755 file_chmod=0644
