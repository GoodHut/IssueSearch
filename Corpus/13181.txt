 URL : "https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/278" TITLE : tar and symlinks BODY : oftentimes it's necessary to distribute symbolic links withthin a unix distribution. i'm my case i have an uberexec and a number of links to that exec commanda , commandb that would eventually trigger the same behaviour as uberexec commanda or uberexec commandb . due to the considerable size of a go executable and the complexities of a multibinary project e.g: gogland do not support it multiple binaries might not be an option. perhaps it would be advisable to use the deference flag http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/dereference.html in tar or allow the configuration of the flags in a per type basis.
