 URL : "https://github.com/jacobwindsor/pubchem-ranker/issues/11" TITLE : data set manipulation BODY : hi jacob/egon, the dataset from de lacy costello was manipulated first, by checking which metabolites were already in hmdb and/or chebi. perhaps we should include a similar feature, where the data is compared with wikidata, to find out if certain compounds already are entered in here?
