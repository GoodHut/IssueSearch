BODY : step functions error catching looks at errortype field from lambda result. i've tried following code: import apex_fun github.com/apex/apex/function ... // in handler return nil, &apex_fun.invokeerror{type: yandexaccessdenied , handled: true, message: need to update oauth token } but for some reason response only contains errormessage , no type. i could try to return it as successful response. looking for suggestion how to implement this properly.
