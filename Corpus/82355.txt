 URL : "https://github.com/WrinklyNinja/libloadorder/issues/38" TITLE : add support for esl files BODY : needed for loot/loot 816. a summary of the changes: - files with a .esl extension are light masters. - light masters behave like masters unless otherwise noted. - light masters don't count to the 255 active plugin limit: they take up one space the fe load order index in total, but can share it with a non-light-master plugin. - if a non-light-master plugin shares a load order index with light master plugins, any formid conflicts are won by the light master formid replacing the non-light-master formid. - up to 8192 light masters can be active at the same time, and they're loaded in the order they're listed in plugins.txt . - if over 4096 light masters are active, they start to use formids in the ff index. - there are some new implicitly-active plugins that are light masters. esls have been patched into fallout 4 and skyrim special edition, so they're an update to the asterisk load order method for the purposes of libloadorder's implementation. libloadorder needs to: - recognise .esl files as plugins - allow .esl files to appear anywhere in the load order that a normal .esm or .esp file could go. - when inserting .esl files, treat them as masters. - recognise the new implicitly-active esl plugins. - when checking the active plugin limit, exclude esl plugins.
