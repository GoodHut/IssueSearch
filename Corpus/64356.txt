 URL : "https://github.com/robotrs/rust-wpilib/issues/16" TITLE : future of this project? BODY : some other frc devs and myself are interested in using rust for 2018. we found this repo, but weren't sure if it's still being actively developed. are there plans to maintain it for 2018? we would be more than happy to collaborate if so. otherwise, we'll probably fork and use it as a starting point for the future - if this ends up being the case, was there a rough roadmap left over when development stopped? thanks!
