 URL : "https://github.com/django-polymorphic/django-polymorphic/issues/260" TITLE : how to get base class? BODY : sorry for just a basic question - but i searched and did not find answer. i have something like: class project polymorphicmodel : topic = models.charfield max_length=30 class artproject project : artist = models.charfield max_length=30 class researchproject project : supervisor = models.charfield max_length=30 now i create artproject or researchproject via gui, but later in i need to access objects via another gui which lists only base object types. so while i create artproject i need to know base object type to associate base type and concrete object, but there is no way to obtain it because contenttype.objects.get_for_id object.polymorphic_ctype_id gives me current type, but i need base type and there is no something like base_ctype_id
