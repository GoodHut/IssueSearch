 URL : "https://github.com/kauailabs/navxmxp/issues/45" TITLE : reset only resets yaw BODY : the reset function at least in java and c++ only resets the gyro z axis. is there any reason it does not reset all three axes? our roborio is mounted sideways this year, meaning we are using a different axis as our yaw , but there is no easy way to reset it.
