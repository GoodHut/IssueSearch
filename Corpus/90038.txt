 URL : "https://github.com/dionisiydk/Calypso/issues/62" TITLE : rework naming conventions BODY : hi, currently i tried as an interested person in pharo and calypso to look at its source code and tried to understand it. i have currently some annoying issues when doing that: 1. the package names, class names and also the method names are just too long. i use at home an old flatscreen with a resolution of 1024x768 screen and the names are barely readable: ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1078087/27997202-5b7a297e-64f3-11e7-9621-b94774e0c817.png 2. i hope the target of naming each package, class or method this way was to make it understandable, but it doesn't. what should names like clyinheritedmethodgrouphierarchybuilder really mean? just to give a little insight in my perceived frustration with such a name from my point of view of thinking: ok, it's some kind of builder i guess, it should hopefully build the inheritedmethodgrouphierarchy thingy, whatever that means. but why is it written that way? i mean couldn't you do something like some kind of clybuilder and passing in the kind of what you want to be built? anyway i think the general theme of this issue is perceived understandability by the people who may want to contribute to a project. if it's not understandable lesser people may want to help. thanks for your time.
