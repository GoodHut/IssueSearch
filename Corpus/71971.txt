BODY : hi there! thank you very much for your awesome work! i am not on arch so i simply applied the patches to my distros kernel 4.9.9, like it is done in your pkgbuild file. is this enough for it to work? i am asking because i had a higher power consumption after applying the patches. it went up from 3.9 watts to 4.7 and higher. measured with powertop. laptop is xps13, 2016 - same as yours but with i5 cpu.
