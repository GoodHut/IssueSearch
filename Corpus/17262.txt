 URL : "https://github.com/PhantomWolff/GhostlabTest/issues/1" TITLE : npm install fails BODY : you contacted us some time ago regarding an issue with the inspector in ghostlab v3 bundle.js is not showing up for the project you were working on , and you were so kind to set up a repo for us to reproduce the issue. unfortunately, it is only now that i can look at it, and i'm getting back to you regarding this. i cloned the repo, https://github.com/phantomwolff/ghostlabtest, and wanted to install the dependencies, but unfortunately, the install fails due to dependencies that are only available in your company network: $ npm install npm err! code enotfound npm err! errno enotfound npm err! network request to http://repo.release.cerner.corp/npm/mpagefusion failed, reason: getaddrinfo enotfound repo.release.cerner.corp repo.release.cerner.corp:80 npm err! network this is a problem related to network connectivity. npm err! network in most cases you are behind a proxy or have bad network settings. npm err! network npm err! network if you are behind a proxy, please make sure that the npm err! network 'proxy' config is set properly. see: 'npm help config' if you still would like us to look into this, is there a way to get the dependencies so we could look into the issue? thanks, matthias
