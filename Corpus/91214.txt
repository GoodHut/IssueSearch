 URL : "https://github.com/kiswa/TaskBoard/issues/349" TITLE : taskboard on synology nas BODY : i've installed the latest version of taskboard on my synology ds1515. in summary, the login page comes up but i can't login. f12 shows an http 500. my initial problem was that i didn't have mod_expires loaded. got that loaded. now i get the following error: 2017-03-28t20:09:16+01:00 diskstation1515 tue mar 28 20:09:16 2017 error client 10.1.1.100 fastcgi: server /php56-fpm-handler stderr: php message: php fatal error: require_once : failed opening required '/volume1/web/taskboard/api/../vendor/autoload.php' include_path='.' in /volume1/web/taskboard/api/api.php on line 3, referer: http://10.1.1.17/taskboard/ indeed, this autoload.php file doesn't exist. can someone suggest how to solve this? looking at the source code i don't know php to any level of competency it looks to me as if this file should come with the zip but if it was something that obvious, i'd have thought someone else would have noticed before now! :- many thanks many thanks
