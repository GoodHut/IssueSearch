 URL : "https://github.com/eazebu/RSAExploits/issues/1" TITLE : no base exploit class BODY : as said in reamde, each exploit is implemented as a class that extends a base exploit class. the base exploit class only exports one method called run that takes two parameters. the first parameter is a list of rsadata objects and the second is a dictionary that can be used to specify additional information for particular exploits. for example, the franklin-reiter exploit requires a polynomial that specifies the relationship between two plaintext messages that were used to generate known ciphertexts. the presence of the run method provides a common interface that a user can use to call any exploit after the list of rsadata objects has been populated. extracting the required information from the rsadata objects is handled by the run function and any subroutines called from there. however, there is not class named exploit. could you help with me?
