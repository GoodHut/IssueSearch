 URL : "https://github.com/atech/postal/issues/407" TITLE : procodile.log disk usage BODY : i just noticed that there's a procodile.log being written to /tmp/postal, and it appears that's it's never being purged or rotated. and after growing for 3+ months, it's using up most of the disk space on our postal server. what was the intent of this log, and how it would be managed over time?
