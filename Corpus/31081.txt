 URL : "https://github.com/keybase/client/issues/7628" TITLE : revoked all devices BODY : hello, i revoked all devices when resetting my passphrase which has prevented me from logging into any clients until i reset my account. when logged into my account in the browser, the spot to reset the account has been replaced with a notification to install the client, but does not go away after uninstall and reinstallation on all devices. i apologize in advance for any inconvenience, what steps do i need to take to remedy this? username - joshyouuh josh
