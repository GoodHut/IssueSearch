 URL : "https://github.com/code-iai/iai_kinect2/issues/349" TITLE : calibration of kinect v2 BODY : i tried the calibration procedure mentioned in the documentation, but i am curious to know whether i should add the color and ir calibration files in kinect2_bridge package beform i perform the rosrun kinect2_calibration kinect2_calibration chessboard5x7x0.03 record sync and the perform the calibrate process or i should do without them. does the calibration needs to be done repeatedly to achieve efficient calibration because i have performed calibration of kinect camera three times using 5x7x0.03.
