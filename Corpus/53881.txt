 URL : "https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pcf-pipelines/issues/196" TITLE : export opsman settings BODY : not an issue but a suggestion when running opsman upgrade pipeline it would be great if you allow some option to move the export of opsman to an external source ie artifactory . this way if we need the export to recover we have it. current process now is run an export and then transfer that export to a different location.
