 URL : "https://github.com/coala/coala-atom/issues/62" TITLE : fix lint on fly BODY : as i understand, coala atom starts analyse after any edit event, but not after saving of current file. so, i think that it will be better to cache data and not to run new instance of coala cli if file checksum or last change time is the same . or better to rewrite code as indie linter provider and run analyse on custom events not after every change .
