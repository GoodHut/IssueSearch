 URL : "https://github.com/koekeishiya/chunkwm/issues/182" TITLE : dbeaver autocomplete issue BODY : in dbeaver ee, the autocomplete suggestions register as windows which causes chunkwm to freak out any time one pops up during sql query writing which is frequent . i've tried utilizing chunkc tiling::query --desktop windows and chunkid: aliased to chunkc tiling::query --window <id> to find enough information to write a window rule but was unsuccessful. the owner of the autocomplete tooltip doesn't stick around long enough to query window properties with the owner id. a temporary fix is to write a chunkwm rule that makes all dbeaver windows float, but that's less than ideal. i'd rather make just the autocomplete tooltips float. thoughts?
