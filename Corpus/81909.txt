 URL : "https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/issues/6619" TITLE : acrobotplant unit testing BODY : as shown by the fix in 6599, drake's acrobotplant lacks unit tests. at a minimum, we should have test coverage for that one specific bug fix, but in general i think it would benefit drake to have our key examples such as acrobot demonstrate our best ideas on how to write and test systems, and as such it should have more complete functional testing coverage. note that the easiest way to ensure that 6599 has appropriate test coverage is likely by _removing_ code -- by changing the member fields into declared framework parameters per the existing todo, we would be leveraging the framework's infrastructure and not need any acrobot-specific paramters-survive-transmogrification test case!
