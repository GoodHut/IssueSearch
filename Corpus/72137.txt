 URL : "https://github.com/sevin7676/SurvivalArenaTracking/issues/25" TITLE : back to back boss levels BODY : often the random waves will end up sending back to back mini-boss or boss waves, or a ridiculous sequence of bosses and mini bosses. this has been reported since random waves started in 2.1. i just received bosses on level 17, 18, and 20 on crab fest. this is not enjoyable. please ensure that boss waves have a minimum spacing between them and the same for mini-bosses .
