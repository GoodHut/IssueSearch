 URL : "https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra/issues/256" TITLE : unrecognized key warnings BODY : i can't quite tell why this is happening, but quite often when i'm writing the bindings in a defhydra, i'll get lots of warnings like warning emacs : unrecognized key: _q_ . what's more, they happen with every single keystroke that i type. so i might get a dozen of those warnings for any given binding i type. is there any way to turn off those warnings? they are really distracting and don't seem to provide any useful information.
