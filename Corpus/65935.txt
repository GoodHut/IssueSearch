 URL : "https://github.com/flosse/kartevonmorgen/issues/363" TITLE : localize command in url BODY : bio-verbraucher e.v. would like to use our map but wish, that the iframe centralizes to the city of the user. that means, we need a command i.e. kartevonmorgen.org/ /?center= here &zoom=15.85 which makes the user to get where he is. that would be also very nice to use that on stickers etc. so that when you scan a code, the map is more or less close to the shop you are actually visiting.
