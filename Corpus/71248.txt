 URL : "https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/issues/4677" TITLE : add a v4l2 mem2mem hwdec BODY : mpv version and platform 0.26.0-40-g81851febc4, on linux on arm. reproduction steps - have a random arm board. - want to play a video on it. - start it in mpv, with hwdec=auto since you heard it’s useful. expected behavior the video plays fine. actual behavior your cpu is way too slow since you are on a terrible arm board, so swdec can’t keep up with whatever huge video file you gave it. ffmpeg now got a m2m driver https://ffmpeg.org/pipermail/ffmpeg-devel/2017-july/214067.html , which could be used as a copy hwdec by mpv. it is the de-facto api for video decoding in linux, and is implemented for many socs so it shouldn’t be very hard to find supported hardware for testing. log file n/a sample files any hard enough to decode file.
