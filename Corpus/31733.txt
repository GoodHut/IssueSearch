 URL : "https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDAnative.jl/issues/117" TITLE : support for atomics BODY : it seems that device atomics primarily work with the llvm atomics, except for a few special functions. exceptions nvvm atomic add, increment, and decrement for addressspaces: none, 1, 3 declare float @llvm.nvvm.atomic.load.add.f32.p0f32 float address, float val declare i32 @llvm.nvvm.atomic.load.inc.32.p0i32 i32 address, i32 val declare i32 @llvm.nvvm.atomic.load.dec.32.p0i32 i32 address, i32 val atomics with scope only supported on sm_60+ target feature satom see https://reviews.llvm.org/d24944 todo - decide if we want a specific cuatomic/atomicptr type or can we just work with normal deviceptr - port https://github.com/julialang/julia/blob/master/base/atomics.jl - add support for nvvm atomic add, increment and decrement - add support for satomic on sm_60 && chekc which llvm version has support for that.
