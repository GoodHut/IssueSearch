 URL : "https://github.com/SNAS/website/issues/48" TITLE : add components section BODY : we have several components that each have their own set of documents. i'm recommending we remove the docs section considering develop section will be added along with this new section to document each component. instead of using the default list for components, we should create a new list type 'components' for this section that supports organizing list items by category. we can then categorize the components so that it's easier to navigate. for example, core, mrt, data handling e.g. mysql consumer and the topology manager .
