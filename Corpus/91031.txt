 URL : "https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/issues/6" TITLE : support multiple prefixes BODY : originally bazelbuild/rules_go 313 gazelle should recognize directives like gazelle:prefix example.com/my/project . this should define the prefix for the directory where they are defined and subdirectories. gazelle should not require a -go_prefix argument on the command line if a directive like this is found in the top-level build file. this would be useful for monorepos with possibly multiple go subtrees that aren't at the repository root.
