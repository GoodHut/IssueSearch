 URL : "https://github.com/Markup360/graviton/issues/13" TITLE : mysql setup problems BODY : ah it was all going so well... big grin following through with the tutorial vids for the local install, and only after i got various failures when trying to run installer.php, discovered the how to create a mysql database in wamp video. mysql presumably needs to be configured? coming from webplus, and dreamweaver visual designer before that, i've got no mysql experience. so, trying to sort the mysql setup going to phpmyadmin through wamp, i first get a login screen not featured in the video! and if i enter something random, i've got no option at all to add a new database. suggestions welcome! pics attached. -originally asked by digitalbulldog on 09-06-2016, 05:26 pm, migrated from site forum
