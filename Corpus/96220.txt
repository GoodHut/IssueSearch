 URL : "https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/issues/274" TITLE : enhancement: people widget BODY : hi, i am currently trying to set up a new website for my lab, and i truly love the academic theme for hugo! very, very good job! perfect for what i'm looking for. one piece i am missing though would be a specific widget for people. i know i could use a custom widget, for instance based on teaching, but what i want is a layout similar to the projects widget: a grid of people with their portraits, and a toolbar to filter them in my case: all , current and alumni . i have been able to work around it duplicating the project widget and associated html page , as well as the css and js pieces into custom css and js files , replacing every instance of project / projects by people . it almost works, with the same problem as 100, in which filtering in the toolbar seems to be global, and filters both projects and people. in other words, this is redundant to 100 in the sense that the essential problem is to be able to reuse the filter toolbar, but i also think that a people widget makes a lot of sense for an academic website. thanks!
