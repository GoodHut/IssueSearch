 URL : "https://github.com/badges/shields/issues/941" TITLE : size of an npm package BODY : it's quite common that developers want to find out the size of a framework/library before dropping it into their own project. while there's already a badge for displaying file and repo sizes, most library authors don't check in dist files into their repo. i made a heroku app that lets you know the gzipped + minified size of any npm package after bundling - https://cost-of-modules.herokuapp.com was wondering if a badge for the same would be useful?
