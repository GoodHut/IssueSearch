 URL : "https://github.com/facebook/prepack/issues/1085" TITLE : output typed code. BODY : feature suggestion. allow outputting code that has at least all of the type information that prepack understands. currently, types are assumed and come in from model declarations, including automatically with babel-plugin-flow-prepack , but the output code is completely untyped. printing the types would be good for debugging, but most importantly it allows further tools to benefit from the type information, for example - closure compiler.
