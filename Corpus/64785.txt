BODY : im trying my hard to understand how to use this gem properly. as far as i understand, after i use credentials.fetch_access_token! and session = googledrive::session.from_credentials credentials , i have a new googledrive::session instance saved in session that i can use to issue commands. i managed to test some commands and they work. i can open and edit spreadsheets trough that session instance. the issue is: obviously, as soon as my rails action run, that instance of googledrive::session is going to be garbaged collected. it can't be that i must iniciate the credentials process all over since i just received a token with 1 hour expiration, right? but how to persist that instance of googledrive::session for 1 hour or how to re-use that token? i tried saving the return of credentials.fetch_access_token! in the database and then using googledrive::session.from_credentials user.last_token but it doesnt work and returns dailylimitexceededunreg errors.
