 URL : "https://github.com/philsquared/Catch/issues/811" TITLE : question about context BODY : description is there away to make each unit_test case within a _test.cpp file _forget_ the context of already initialized variables? example: uint16_t state = 0 / this test passes because init_module returns 1 - as expected. / unit_test test initialize , test { state = init_module ; require state == 1 ; } / this test passes because the previous test sets state = 1, yet the state is initialized as 0. if this test was positioned above the first test this test would fail, but i would expect this test to fail regardless of where it is positioned. / unit_test test state , test { require state == 1 ; } i know the command line switch to order tests in the random mode could help in getting around this problem and the unit_test -> sections implementation could be helpful. any advice on how i could make the second test fail without going into trouble and writing _de_init_ functions in every _test.cpp file?
