 URL : "https://github.com/jgoppert/pymola/issues/9" TITLE : casadi notebook example BODY : i think the new casadi backend is great, but i don't know much about using it, would be great if we could add a demo notebook of how to use the existing casadi model that is created to do simulation and jacobians of vector functions with respect to vector variables a = df/dx, b = df/du, etc. . i copied the demo casadi notebook and tried to get it running myself but found it confusing, see test/casadi.ipynb. @jbaayen
