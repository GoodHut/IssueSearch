 URL : "https://github.com/brodeau/barakuda/issues/9" TITLE : new configuration at ucl BODY : hi @brodeau , just to let you know that we are installing barakuda on our national cluster zenobe - juste une fois. i have opened a develop branch develop-ucl that i haven't pushed yet, because i don't know if you expect users of barakuda to feed back on the project. in case you do, i'm going to push this branch now. once i'm done configuring, i'll give it a try to see how our ec-earth3.2 run is doing. cheers, fran√ßois
