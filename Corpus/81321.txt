 URL : "https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/issues/1175" TITLE : wiki code review request BODY : i added some code to the wiki that adds a preview to some of the git commands https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/wiki/examples git : - fco_preview - fcoc_preview - fshow_preview these work nicely for me, and might warrant replacing the non-preview versions in the wiki, but since i'm not very well versed in shell scripting, i'd like to request a code-review for them.
