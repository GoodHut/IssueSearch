 URL : "https://github.com/mobeets/mpm/issues/26" TITLE : mpm on and mpm off BODY : once we start managing installations see 24 , we can give mpm a more venv-like functionality by allowing users to enable/disable certain packages from being in the path see 20 . e.g., mpm on matlab2tikz adds the paths e.g., as listed in pathlist if it exists , while mpm off matlab2tikz removes them.
