 URL : "https://github.com/harrytallbelt/verifiable-tests/issues/30" TITLE : custom definitions support BODY : can we allow the user teacher to add their own definitions to simplify the description of the task? for example { precondition : n = n && x = x && equalarrays a, a && contains a, x, 0, n-1 , ... definitions : { name : contains , arguments : a , x , from , to , definition : e k : from <= k <= to : a k = x }, ... ... } would this be consistent with perm - a predicate that we do not define, only describe some of its properties.
