 URL : "https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/1609" TITLE : codedeploy on the bastion BODY : hi, we're looking for a workflow along the lines of: travis-ci builds a git tag. travis-ci does $thing to cause a deployment in kubernetes. we want to use a private cluster with a bastion to achieve this and we don't want to have travis ssh into the bastion to issue commands as that's fairly error prone. we're considering integrating codedeploy into the aws ami for the bastion. it's written in ruby so it would drag those dependencies in, but otherwise is relatively harmless. it listens for connections from the aws codedeploy service and then orchestrates deployment actions for a given repository. we would use this to automatically run kubectl deploy, or helm, etc, for a given service without having to add ssh keys to travis-ci and have it ssh in and try to remotely run commands. we're open to suggestions of a better way to do this if people feel codedeploy is too large a dependency to add.
