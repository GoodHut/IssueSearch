 URL : "https://github.com/stephencelis/ghi/issues/333" TITLE : github project support BODY : github's new projects feature see the help page, about projects https://help.github.com/articles/about-projects/ is a helpful, kanban-like way of organizing issues in a repo. i used ghi open to create a ton of issues to a repo that's been using the project feature, but i don't have an automated way to add those issues to the project other than to tediously drag them one by one into the project columns. please dig into the github api, find out how issues get associated with project columns, and add an option to ghi open , ghi edit , etc. to set or change those associations.
