 URL : "https://github.com/christkv/kerberos/issues/60" TITLE : documentation on usage BODY : is there any documentation available for how to use this package? it gives help with installation and debugging installation, but as far as i can see there's no support for how to actually use the package. a little more than the code is it's own documentation would go a long way towards getting to understand this package.
