 URL : "https://github.com/serge-rider/dbeaver/issues/1325" TITLE : highlight text in results BODY : a good feature from other database clients: sometimes i need to highlight a text in all resultset. similar to browsers when searching for text. the filtering option is forcing me to write sql but i just need to make visible some text in all columns no matter which column that text is located. regards
