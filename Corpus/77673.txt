 URL : "https://github.com/rolandleth/LTHRadioButton/issues/4" TITLE : not clickable by default BODY : hello, essentially a radio button in web development is always clickable. however, your implementation does not provide the basic click funcion, so we need to add a tap gesture on the view and manually set to select state or not selected state based on the current state of the view. i think this initialization should be inside the view, and have a delegate that let us know when the state changed. let me know what you think about it cheers
