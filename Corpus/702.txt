 URL : "https://github.com/riboseinc/rnp/issues/451" TITLE : get rid of BODY : description reworded from @dewyatt . pgp_mem_readfile messages should be eliminated from the function itself, but the messages should be logged at the call site, where there is enough context to determine whether something is normal or an error. sometimes it's perfectly ok for a file to not exist. steps to reproduce https://travis-ci.org/riboseinc/rnp/jobs/273893046 expected behavior do not display pgp_mem_readfile messages if it a file is supposed to not exist. actual behavior pgp_mem_readfile messages shows up regardless if a file should exist or not.
