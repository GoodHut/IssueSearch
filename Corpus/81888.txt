 URL : "https://github.com/mickdekkers/vue-howler/issues/22" TITLE : access the howl instance? BODY : i'm trying to figure out the status of the howl instance i'm working with. vuehowler provides no way for me to get it directly, so how do i properly access the howl-instance and figure out the status manually ? in the vue dev tools, i can see that the <player>-component has a _howl attribute an object in which there is a _status attribute. this is the one i need, but i can't figure out how to get it programmatically. any pointers?
