 URL : "https://github.com/toddams/RazorLight/issues/63" TITLE : .net core 2.0 status BODY : microsoft has rolled out .net core 2.0-preview1 and i thought that it's a good time to start 2.0 version of razorlight. but today got an email from razor repo about another refactoring / breaking changes, like this one: https://github.com/aspnet/announcements/issues/242 . that makes things a little bit more complicated, as i don't know whether microsoft guys will not yet another breaking change before stable release. so i created this issue in order to let you know about the status of the development. so we are waiting for stable release and right after that 2.0 will start it's development.
