 URL : "https://github.com/dgrunwald/rust-cpython/issues/88" TITLE : add class with custom name BODY : currently, you must create a class like: rust py_class! class pyworld |py| { ... } but if i'd like to make the class world rather than pyworld inside of the python program, how can i add_class in the module initializer with the name as world rather than pyworld . i have read the documentation https://dgrunwald.github.io/rust-cpython/doc/cpython/struct.pymodule.html method.add_class and it doesn't seem like it's possible. any ideas?
