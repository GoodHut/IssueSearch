 URL : "https://github.com/HewlettPackard/mpgc/issues/47" TITLE : add regression tests BODY : imported from hpe issue 276 it would be a very good idea if we had a series of regression tests possibly one for mpgc, one for mds, and maybe one for the mds java api that we could run after making a change to determine that at the very least we hadn't broken anything that could be deterministically tested. ideally, this would be a suite that could be automatically run and where it would be easy to add tests to. there are some regression and acceptance test in the current test suit for the mds java api, but we still have to add a lot of tests. mvn test -dtestsuite=suite/acceptance.xml mvn test -dtestsuite=suite/regression.xml
