 URL : "https://github.com/haf/expecto/issues/179" TITLE : test results file. BODY : for projects using vsts as their ci system, it'd be really amazing if expecto could optionally via a command line parameter generate a testresults file in an ncrunch or xunit compatible xml format a la: https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/build/steps/test/publish-test-results ... i realize that as i'm asking for this, that of course a free pony would be amazing, too. but to the extent that it was on someone's radar as well, i figured it worth tracking. : thanks!
