 URL : "https://github.com/circleci/circleci.test/issues/7" TITLE : add global once fixtures BODY : there are some fixtures that need to be performed exactly once per test invocation, for instance database schema modifications don't need to be run once per namespace. having a third category of fixtures such as :once-global which are run exactly once per invocation of circleci.test would enable this test-var , test-ns , run-tests , run-all-tests , dir , -main . we'd shave a couple of 10s of seconds off one of our test-suite's run time.
