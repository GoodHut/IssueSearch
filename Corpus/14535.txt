 URL : "https://github.com/xproc/3.0-specification/issues/116" TITLE : attribute depends BODY : the explanation of depends in 2.5.1 additional dependent connections needs, at least from my point of view, two clarifications: a we have to mention, that the attribute needs to be in xproc's namespace, so it does not mingle with other attributes defined by a user declared step. b the specs say that the value of the attribute has to be a list of step names. i propose to clarify this by saying, it is a list of step names separated by blanks.
