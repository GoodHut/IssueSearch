 URL : "https://github.com/vinhkhuc/MemN2N-babi-python/issues/10" TITLE : supports python 3.x BODY : this repository is really awesome. i usually use python 3, so i modified a little. the modifications of nn.py is probably compatible between python 2 and 3. but pickle's loading func is not compatible. zip does not produce a list in python 3 anymore. and there may be more smart way of loading pickle data in python 3. please see my modification. https://github.com/jojonki/memn2n-babi-python/commit/a10f53da08aa4fe431c592ed54c9e18ead64318d if you are not interested in supporting python 3.x, please close this ticket. thank you.
