 URL : "https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/issues/340" TITLE : way to validate yamls? BODY : it's obviously really easy to make mistakes in our lesson yaml metadata blocks. if you look at the two lessons below, the first uses 'reviewer' to list the editor, and the second uses an 'editor' tag for the same. https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/blob/gh-pages/lessons/topic-modeling-and-mallet.md https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/blob/gh-pages/lessons/editing-audio-with-audacity.md is there a way we can validate these before publication somehow so that editors are prompted when they may have made a mistake? consistency across lessons is obviously what we're aiming for.
