 URL : "https://github.com/jpuri/react-draft-wysiwyg/issues/379" TITLE : reduce bundle size BODY : this is next big task i am planning to do for the editor, i will break it into modules which user can independently install and still use in editor like right now. i want to develop more features for the editor - but doing it in single editor will result in much increased bundle size its much atm even ; this will be breaking change and will be followed by 2.0 release. suggestions welcome.
