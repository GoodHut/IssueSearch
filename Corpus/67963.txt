 URL : "https://github.com/qrtt1/jplurk-oauth/issues/16" TITLE : real time notifications BODY : 1. realtime.cometuserchannel use realtime.cometuserchannel to get data from plurk https comet server https://comet02.plurk.com/comet , which /app/realtime/getuserchannel returns will get: com.google.jplurk_oauth.skeleton.requestexception: org.scribe.exceptions.oauthexception: problems while creating connection if i change comet server url from https to http , no more connection problems occur, but always get weird { new_offset : -1} even if i reponsed to that timeline. 2. getuserchannel string channel & getuserchannel string channel, args optional these two methods always return the same response as getuserchannel . it seems like channel and offset is the get params of comet_server url, like https://comet02.plurk.com/comet?channel=xxxxxxxxx&offset=0 , not for the /app/realtime/getuserchannel api. i'm a newer of comet channel. so there may be some problems in my words.
