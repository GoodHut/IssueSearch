 URL : "https://github.com/donkirkby/live-py-plugin/issues/126" TITLE : pycharm navigation breaks BODY : steps to reproduce: 1. open a long python file in pycharm, and go to the top. 2. from the navigate menu, choose file structure.... 3. confirm that there is at least one method or function defined that is not currently visible on the screen. 4. close the file and reopen it. go to the top, if you're not already there. 5. from the navigate menu, choose file structure.... 6. click on a method or function that is not currently visible on the screen. expected behaviour: the cursor moves to the method or function definition. actual behaviour: nothing happens. if you leave the file open and restart pycharm, navigation works again. it breaks if you open the file while pycharm is open. disabling the livepy plugin stops the problem.
