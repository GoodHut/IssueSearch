 URL : "https://github.com/expressjs/express/issues/3324" TITLE : error: connect econnreset BODY : i have an express server running on localhost through app.listen . it serves images through app.get 'imageid' . the images are read from a db. i have a client application firing 400+ requests at the same time through http.get after the first 300+ requests, i get this error on the client side for each subsequent request: error: connect econnreset 127.0.0.1:8080 there is no stack or any further detail. on the server side, i have these error handlers, but none of them print anything: server.on 'error', function err { console.error 'on error handler' ; console.error err ; } ; server.on 'clienterror', function err { console.error 'on clienterror handler' ; console.error err ; } ; process.on 'uncaughtexception', function err { console.error 'process.on handler' ; console.error err ; } ; my guess is that the server is not able to handle all the requests at once and it starts rejecting the connections until it frees resources, but haven't found a way to prove it. is there a way to specify the number of connections on the server? am i doing something wrong on the server side to handle the error?
