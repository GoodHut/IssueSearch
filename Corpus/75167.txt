BODY : would be useful. i have mingw only so far my dualboot fedora has broken internet for some reason , so i can't debug without mingw support. however, the posix_memalign ... mapping utility is included multiple times, which results in redefinition errors in spite of the common pattern that normally should prevent that. packaging it into a library apparently didn't help either. so if we need that which i would assume , we'll have to think off something.
