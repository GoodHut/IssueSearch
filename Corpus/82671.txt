 URL : "https://github.com/rails/webpacker/issues/400" TITLE : angular cli compatibility BODY : it would be great to use the cli to generate angular components inside a rails app as happen with rails generators. since now i've been able to starting from a fresh rails 5.1.1 project : - x integrate a generated cli project pointing src root to app/javascript /packs - x adjust the webpack config to use external html and css files generated from cli - x compile frontend in development - x generate components using cli - test production env - add aot to webpack - wrap ng cli to a rails generator optional but cool i'm wondering if it would be possible to enhance _webpacker:install_ to generate an angular cli compatible structure ready to work, an hello_word example a little bit more complex with separated html and css or take it out to a another gem, something like angular_rails_cli wrapping/using webpacker?
