 URL : "https://github.com/ronghanghu/tensorflow_compact_bilinear_pooling/issues/2" TITLE : cuda 7.0 support BODY : hi, thank you so much for sharing the code. i am having a problem with the sequential fft and ifft as my cuda is 7.0. i cannot update the cuda since the server is from my uni. could you please give me some hints or suggestions how could i implement it in cuda 7.0? bellow are error log: traceback most recent call last : file compact_bilinear_pooling_test.py , line 5, in <module> from compact_bilinear_pooling import compact_bilinear_pooling_layer file /users/ud2017/hoavt/nli/dynet_tut/tensorflow_compact_bilinear_pooling/compact_bilinear_pooling.py , line 6, in <module> from sequential_fft import sequential_batch_fft, sequential_batch_ifft file /users/ud2017/hoavt/nli/dynet_tut/tensorflow_compact_bilinear_pooling/sequential_fft/__init__.py , line 1, in <module> from .sequential_batch_fft_ops import sequential_batch_fft, sequential_batch_ifft file /users/ud2017/hoavt/nli/dynet_tut/tensorflow_compact_bilinear_pooling/sequential_fft/sequential_batch_fft_ops.py , line 10, in <module> 'build/sequential_batch_fft.so' file /users/ud2017/hoavt/hoa_env/wrath-virt/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/load_library.py , line 64, in load_op_library none, none, error_msg, error_code tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.notfounderror: libcudart.so.8.0: cannot open shared object file: no such file or directory
