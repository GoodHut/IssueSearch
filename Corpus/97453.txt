BODY : loved how you used comments in your html and css labeling groups of elements/styling rules! it makes it easier for reviewers like me to understand your code, and you too if you decide to look back on this code in the future. it's definitely worth the extra effort. furthermore, very wise of you to add alt attributes to your images to make for valid html! wonderful work!
