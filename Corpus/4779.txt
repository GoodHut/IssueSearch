 URL : "https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser/issues/758" TITLE : get rid of <?> BODY : some node types are generic, only to indicate the return type of the setters. this is useless for the user who has to add <?> to all these types. type avoids this with a trick: the setter for annotations returns type and the inherting classes like uniontype override it casting the return type to the correct one. java @override public uniontype setannotations nodelist<annotationexpr> annotations { return uniontype super.setannotations annotations ; } this concerns typedeclaration , bodydeclaration , and referencetype . although this breaks the api, i don't think anybody will complain about having to remove this crap.
