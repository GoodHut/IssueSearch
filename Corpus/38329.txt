 URL : "https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/issues/6121" TITLE : parenthesis and urls BODY : parenthesis are legitimate characters in a url. rfc 2396 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2396 section-2.3 : «data characters that are allowed in a uri ... - | _ | . | ! | ~ | | ' | | » this leads to mastodon considering the following link to end with background instead of including the remaining .html : https://coolguy.website/writing/the-future-will-be-technical/background .html i know that markdown use parenthesis to enclose an url but this is a problematic idea. i think we should include parenthesis and only exclude the closing parenthesis if and only if it is at the end of the string, or before whitespace, or before punctuation and whitespace or the end of the status. something like the following: http://example.com/foo includes all http://example.com/foo .html includes all http://example.com/foo . excludes period http://example.com/foo .html includes all see http://example.com/foo excludes last parenthesis see http://example.com/foo . excludes last period and parenthesis see http://example.com/foo . excludes last parenthesis and period see http://example.com/foo .html . excludes last parenthesis and period - x i searched or browsed the repo’s other issues to ensure this is not a duplicate. - this bug happens on a tagged release https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/releases and not on master if you're a user, don't worry about this .
