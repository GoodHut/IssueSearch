 URL : "https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/1091" TITLE : source for sort.exe BODY : i apologize for asking what i imagine is obvious. i would like to read the source for sort.exe. i thought i might find a file called sort.c. other unix core tools implementations on windows have a sort.c. i could not find it, nor could i find a make target of sort.exe. i have not coded c in 15 years. your kind assistance in helping to set me in the right direction is greatly appreciated. thank you.
