 URL : "https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues/4394" TITLE : add nvidia cloud? BODY : a while back nvidia announced they'd start their own gpu cloud https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gpu-cloud/ . if this gets serverless functionality as well, it might end up getting worth adding here. i'm fairly clueless as to its current state though, as it still seems to be in beta. feel free to close until relevant; just wanted to put the idea out there fwiw.
