 URL : "https://github.com/OpenShot/openshot-qt/issues/943" TITLE : only shows the tracks BODY : i'm not really sure whats going on. i just downloaded openshot, it told me to go through the tutorial, and i did. now i'm stuck on a page that shows just the tracks. when i try to import a video it just doesn't show up. in the beginning of the tutorial it had a little box that shows pictures/videos, i suppose, but now its gone it just shows the tracks. ive re-downloaded it twice. anybody know how to fix it? thank you üëç
