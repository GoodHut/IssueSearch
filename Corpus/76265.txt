 URL : "https://github.com/erikras/redux-form/issues/2649" TITLE : ios chrome form autofill BODY : when the form is autofilled, all the inputs are filled with values i.e., html form is getting updated. but the bind actions are not getting triggered which is preventing the redux form state from being updated. only the first input field state value is being set. when the other input fields are touched, the input is being set to empty, because the form state of the input field is empty. i am facing the issue only on ios chrome. in remaining other browser, autofill triggers all the input bind actions. is it an issue with redux form or its the issue with chrome on ios? thanks
