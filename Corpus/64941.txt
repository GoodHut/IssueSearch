 URL : "https://github.com/YetiForceCompany/YetiForceCRM/issues/5039" TITLE : https encryption emails BODY : all our sites run under ssl of course but still the whole team gets messages like: https encryption your connection to the server is not encrypted. if the connection is not established through the https protocol the communication may be intercepted or altered by third parties. the recommended configuration can be found in the web server requirements article in the documentation. where can we switch this off? it's clearly fault and send to way to many people. not a good idea....
