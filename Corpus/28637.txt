 URL : "https://github.com/cboulay/PSMoveService/issues/418" TITLE : hid_write on mac os BODY : hid_write does not work correctly on mac os while trying to write data to a hid device on windows , we've encountered the same issue as described in your comments: _unfortunately in windows simply writing to the hid device, via writefile internally, doesn't appear to actually set the data on the controller despite returning successfully . in the ds4 implementation they use the hidd_setoutputreport win32 api call instead. unfortunately hidapi doesn't have any equivalent call, so we have to make our own._ on windows , we've fixed this behavior by replacing _hid_write _ with _ hidd_setoutputreport _ however, on mac os, you've specified that _ hid_write _ and _ hid_read _ are working correctly with a ps4 dual shock controller. in our case, we've also tested this code using a ps4 controller on mac os, and the functions do not work correctly: more precisely, the device expects the data as a control transfer , not as an interrupt transfer . on windows, _hidd_setoutputreport _ is used for control transfers, while _writefile _ is used for interrupt transfers, could you please send us more details on your tests and how you've managed to make the code work on mac os? or, if you know any functions that we can use on mac os for command transfers ?
