 URL : "https://github.com/keppelen/react-facebook-login/issues/124" TITLE : making it work on mobile BODY : hi, i have the component set up and working well, however on mobile it doesn't work at all - the facebook popup never appears, and it redirects me to my login and appends a code= some_code &state=facebookdirect string of parameters to the url. it doesn't seem like the provided callback is ever called. i read through the documentation and related issues - could someone clarify how to use the component on mobile? am i supposed to set a redirecturi? if so is that uri then in turn meant to pass the authetication data to the backend and log the user in? for reference here is my current code: <facebooklogin appid='998508906904354' autoload={false} fields='name,email,picture' callback={this.responsefacebook.bind this } icon= fa-facebook size= small cssclass= button-facebook-login textbutton={strings.login_facebook} ismobile={true} /> thanks in advance!
