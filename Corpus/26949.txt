 URL : "https://github.com/PROGRADE-Tech/Tarchivebot/issues/8" TITLE : chat history lookup BODY : in the frontend, have kind-of a search functionality where you can filter through and search for a word in the entire database of your chat. example: in the search input-form, you enter atom editor . through async requests a table with sentences that contain atom editor is shown, if there's any in that particular chat. i'd prefer not to have to reload the site for that. i consider this to be core functionality and thus part of the first milestone https://github.com/prograde-tech/tarchivebot/milestone/1 . especially considering the name of this project is called tarchive. an archive should be easy to search, through, right? thanks in advance for the feedback.
