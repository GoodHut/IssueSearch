 URL : "https://github.com/Daniel12321/AdventureMMO/issues/38" TITLE : suggestion loot variety BODY : adding variety to the things you can get, related to the skills, would for sure add a lot of roleplay value and create dynamic competition. i'm thinking about stuff like adding new fishes even if they're just renamed items and a fish length and weigth value in the item description, for fishing. and maybe extra descriptions like this fish has an xyz pattern on abc. or something. same for farming crops , mining gems , and whatever else fits. though i'm not sure if there is a way to make the items keep their ability to stack in the inventory with those custom descriptions. if it can't be done in a vanilla way, then maybe the plugin could keep track of which different items with different descriptions are in which stack in which player inventory, so neither stackability nor variety have to be sacrificed. even though those items would for now serve no purpose, i'm sure players would compete in getting the biggest fish, and the nicest gems, making gameplay very interesting.
