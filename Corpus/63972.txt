 URL : "https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh/issues/334" TITLE : feature request: semver BODY : we use http://semver.org/. well, we kind of use semver. we number our releases 1.2.3 and we bump the patch every time we do a hotfix and we bump minor every time we do a release. not everyone will use it like this, but i reckon most people that use git flow will be using semver in some form or other. i'd like it if i could do git flow hotfix start --patch or git flow release start --minor . my proposal therefore is to add patch , minor and major flags to both the release and hotfix commands. these flags would remove the need to explicitly provide a version number instead that would be generated by bumping the correct digit from the existing tag list. i'd also like these commands to zero pad the release numbers, so that they sort correctly when printed. we use 0.00.00 since we've never had the major version get over 10 but i imagine this mask would need to be customisable.
