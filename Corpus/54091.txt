 URL : "https://github.com/vgough/encfs/issues/399" TITLE : file holes improvement BODY : hi, here is an idea to improve file holes. when writing blocks full of 0, we could simply avoid encoding them, so that zeros are then written to storage. encfs already knows how to correctly read these 0 blocks them thanks to its _file holes_ feature. some storage fs, such as zfs, have built-in compression zle for example and would then benefit from this. i had a look to the source code, rather simple to implement. not sure however about security concerns. ben
