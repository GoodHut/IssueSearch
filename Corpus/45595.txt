 URL : "https://github.com/HappyZombies/brackette/issues/9" TITLE : improve and update ui BODY : currently the ui uses propeller http://propeller.in/ , which is fairly straight forward to use, but i am thinking that it be best if this app uses some type of front end framework, i am looking into what to use and i am currently leaning towards react. since the site uses cookies which i might change to local storage... , it be straightforward to use and we probably won't have to use redux.
