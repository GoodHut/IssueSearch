 URL : "https://github.com/AsynkronIT/protoactor-dotnet/issues/100" TITLE : code style discussion BODY : i generally try to avoid discussions about code style, i think that the default resharper settings are almost always the way to go. but, being a go developer also, i have started to like forced braces on conditionals. e.g. csharp if x { foo ; } //vs if x foo ; my personal opinion is that it adds a nice symmetri to the code. another thing i personally like to see, is to use c 7 features when possible. e.g. throws expressions for null validation. named tuples etc. thoughts? is this something we can do or am i too damaged by go? :
