BODY : i need to be able to run multiple files on the same work piece at the same coordinates and change tools between. using f-engrave i haven't found a way to energize/lock motors so this can be done without accidentally changing an axis. is there ui for this? i haven't tried tool changes in a gcode file yet. is this supported? if so are motors locked? how to resume etc.
