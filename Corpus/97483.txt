BODY : hi there, thank you for doing linux support for corsair devices! i am owner corsair h110i gtx extreme and i need to monitor and control it from linux. i downloaded opencorsairlink and found that it does not recognize h110i gtx extreme. quickly looking into the code, i found that my cooler does not fall under any of your device definitions. i added a new entry to corsair_device_info corsairlink_devices structure based on the data from lsusb: { .vendor_id = 0x1b1c, .product_id = 0x0c07, .device_id = 0xff, .name = h110i gtx , / h110i gtx / .read_endpoint = 0x02|libusb_endpoint_in, .write_endpoint = 0x02|libusb_endpoint_out, .driver = &corsairlink_driver_asetek, .led_control_count = 1, .fan_control_count = 1, .pump_index = 0, }, so, with this it works fine and i can see some info and some temperature dev=0, corsairlink device found: h110i gtx! vendor: corsair product: h110i gtx firmware: 2.4.0.0 temperature 0: 30.30 and even to change the pump mode: sudo ./opencorsairlink.elf --device 0 --pump-mode 5 also i see that i can change fancurves and led color which is nice, but is there a way to retrieve the rest of information that provided by corsairlink like pump and fan rpm-speeds ?
