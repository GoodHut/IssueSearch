 URL : "https://github.com/AllTheMods/ATM-Expert/issues/100" TITLE : lab blender and sulfur BODY : with the recent update, it looks like all the sulfur i previously had doesn't work, and the only type that does is abyssalcraft's. i haven't even seen it in the game yet, despite having like 3 different types of sulfur dust floating around from the previous version. there's no actual way to get this sulfur dust from the ore either, as despite jei saying it can be created by the aa crusher, the output is really just ic2 sulfur. sulfur compost is still craftable via coal blocks, but since getting the void ore miner that had been a thing of the past, especially considering sulfur is way more efficient and its sole purpose had been going into feeding the hungry blender.
