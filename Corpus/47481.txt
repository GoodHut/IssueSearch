BODY : i swear to god i'm not trying to bug you guys. i want to post a picture with some benchmarks marked in yellow and also red. from my understanding, the multipoolminer will pick should pick the fastest miner for a particular algo. right? for example: in my screenshot, highlighted in yellow the ccminerpalgin for lyra2re2 is the fastest @ 188.70 mh/s, next fastest is ccminerlyra2re2 for lyra2re2 @ 179.38 mh/s. and last was ccminertpruvot for lyra2re2 @ 153 mh/s. as for lyra2z compared in red i show: ccminernanashi for lyra2z @ 7.02 mh/s next fastest is ccminertpruvot for lyra2z @ 5.37 mh/s here is my question: if i have repeatedly done these benchmarks on my system, and the results are the same - showing a clear fastest miner for a particular algo, can i go into the miners folder and delete the slower miners? the only reason i think this would come in handy is if i adjust the overclock settings and want to re-benchmark, with the slower miners deleted, the benchmarking process would take less time. right? i have come to this theory based on the assumption that several miners that can mine a certain algo are provided because everyone's mining rigs are different, and someone else might show a completely different result. the other theory i have is that i am completely wrong in my assumption, and i should not delete any of those slower miners because they may be designed / coded / to mine a different coin, but it's still using the over all master algo. ie: lyra2re2 or lyra2z also, regarding the faq, i think i have found 2 errors. using the resetbenchmark.bat run as admin or not, does not delete the contents of the stats folder. also, the removelogs.bat mentioned in the faq does not appear to be included in the zip package. ! capture https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23691069/32310722-cc370d54-bf6a-11e7-8824-1009235d547c.png
