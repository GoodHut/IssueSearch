 URL : "https://github.com/conan-io/conan/issues/1357" TITLE : improvements for ci BODY : conan info: - way to dump the dependency graph with package ids to be able to import into a ci system - from a consumer, conan info --build missing will tell us the nodes that will be built, but without levels grouped and without package_id. - the general idea is to be able to merge different consumers/profiles graphs to make more efficient builds.
