 URL : "https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-ios/issues/697" TITLE : tvos support cont'd BODY : hi, i noticed you have a closed tvos support issue: https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-ios/issues/440 but i'm trying to import the framework into a tvos project and i'm getting a handful of sharedapplication is unavailable: not available on tvos app extension - use view controller based solutions where appropriate instead. errors. any suggestions on how to proceed? i tried simply commenting out places where sharedapplication was used, eg: + uiviewcontroller seg_topviewcontroller in uiviewcontroller+segscreen.m but that seems like a fairly critical method.
