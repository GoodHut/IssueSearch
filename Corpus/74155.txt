 URL : "https://github.com/dita4publishers/docs/issues/3" TITLE : dt/dd example incomplete BODY : in the user's guide for the docx2dita, i was using the dt/dd paragraph style listed in: http://www.dita4publishers.org/d4p-users-guide/user_docs/d4p-users-guide/word2dita/common-mapping-cases.html i didn't see this topic in the docs, but the example needs @level added to it in order for it to work. the complete example that is working for me is: <paragraphstyle stylename= definition term structuretype= dt tagname= dt dlentrytype= dlentry containertype= dl topiczone= body level= 1 /> <paragraphstyle stylename= definition description structuretype= dd tagname= dd dlentrytype= dlentry containertype= dl topiczone= body level= 1 />
