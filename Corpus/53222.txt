 URL : "https://github.com/WikiLogic/python-analyzer/issues/1" TITLE : detect and flag cycles BODY : they could be huge. so idea 1: each run of the propagator has an id and marks each claim / argument that it has updated with that id. if it comes across a claim / argument that has already been marked - flag it. also build a separate tool that will let us manually analyze cycles - once we understand what's going on, the tool should be updated to deal with similar situations automagically.
