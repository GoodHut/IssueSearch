 URL : "https://github.com/animatedjs/animated/issues/73" TITLE : still an active library? BODY : forgive the impertinent question. i've just stumbled onto this library, and it looks really impressive, but it hasn't seen a release since early 2017. is this still in active development? i'd like to roll it into the app i'm working on, but obviously wouldn't want to use it if it's dormant. thanks! and sorry
