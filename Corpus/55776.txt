 URL : "https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/gogs/issues/233" TITLE : link to about dcs page BODY : the header link, about dcs , should link to the main page that a user sees if they are not logged in e.g. the page shown in https://github.com/unfoldingword-dev/gogs/pull/230 . i think we need to provide a new url for this page so that it functions when logged in, possibly /about_dcs . once that is setup the link in the header and anywhere else the link exists would need updated to point at that location.
