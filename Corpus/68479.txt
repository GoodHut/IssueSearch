 URL : "https://github.com/lmcarreiro/ui5ts/issues/1" TITLE : runtime call generation BODY : i am currently looking for a way of leveraging typescript's advantages on ui5 applications and found your repo. the only drawback on your method seems to be that the necessary code to call sap.ui.define is generated at runtime. isn't there a way of generating the equivalent .js file already with the right call to sap.ui.define ? have you had other experiences using ui5 with typescript?
