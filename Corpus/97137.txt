 URL : "https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues/5105" TITLE : flow v0.57.2 is not stable BODY : for example, i can remove react-redux_v5.x.x.js from flow-typed/npm folder and flow will not complain. but if i'll change something else - for example, if i'll remove passing of a required prop of a react component to check if flow will find the error - flow will start to see that there's no react-redux libdefs. flow 0.56 worked as expected: started to complain right after remove of libdefs.
