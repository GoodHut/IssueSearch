 URL : "https://github.com/jacekelgda/vacation-status-update/issues/88" TITLE : help bot marking messages BODY : i think this functionality might be quite cool. we already have this func. where bot marks the messages he understands with his special vacation bot emoji. side note: adding custom emoji is not supported by api so it needs to be done manually. separate task will be created to support better ux for creating custom emoji after install i would like to have an option to mark a missed message by bot not marked as with emoji with emoji which would be a signal for bot to start vacation request interview. additional function in here might be to store those messages somewhere to improve our database. this is connected with dara confidentiality and privacy issues so possibly this might not be implemented or only implemented after team agreed to send stats data etc. this could be a separate task as well.
