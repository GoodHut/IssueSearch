 URL : "https://github.com/jscas/cas-server/issues/5" TITLE : hapi v17 and jscas BODY : https://github.com/hapijs/hapi/issues/3658 hapi v17 is essentially a completely new framework. it would require significant work to update jscas to use it. therefore, i am likely going to swap the underlying framework to fastify https://github.com/fastify/fastify once v1.0.0 of fastify is released. the intention is to be as minimally disruptive as possible, but fastify has some features that could potentially change the api of jscas. specifically, the plugin encapsulation that fastify supports could be very useful here. given that this project has been relatively stable for some time now, i will likely release such a version of jscas as v1.0.0.
