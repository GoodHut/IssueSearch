 URL : "https://github.com/dradtke/distchan/issues/2" TITLE : add client ack support BODY : when the server sends a message to a client, it should listen for an ack response from the client to indicate that the send was successful, and drop the client / try again with a different one if no ack is received in a reasonable amount of time. this means that communication between the two will need to include an additional piece of information to indicate the type of the message being sent: 1. <signature> + data + <size> + <body> this is what is currently used, minus the data type specifier 2. <signature> + ack + <input received> new message type to indicate that the input was received and is being processed
