 URL : "https://github.com/themosis/themosis/issues/145" TITLE : cannot use input class BODY : i'm trying to capture query-vars submitted through get by a search form through my controller using inputt::all as stated in the documentation. however, input::all can be used in routes.php, but not in the actual controller to capture the values. i'm probably missing something obvious, but can't figure out what. routes.php route::get 'lawyers/search', 'uses'=>'memberscontroller@filterlawyers' ; controller method public function filterlawyers { $data = input::all ; } // throws error: uncaught symfony\component\debug\exception\fatalthrowableerror: class 'themosis\input' not found not sure on how to add the input class to my controller. please advice. best regards tomas
