 URL : "https://github.com/LOVDnl/LOVD3/issues/233" TITLE : deadlocks in viewlists BODY : viewlists can create deadlocks because of their isolation level. after running tests for 2 months on the shared lovd3 instance, removing the explicitly set isolation level causes no more deadlocks while not causing any other known issues at the same time. we now can include this change in lovd3.
