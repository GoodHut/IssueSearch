 URL : "https://github.com/evshiron/nwjs-builder-phoenix/issues/45" TITLE : beautify user interface BODY : currently the progress bar won't display when running in non-tty e.g. test runners and when building concurrently, i have to mute the output to keep console clean. it's not a solution though. but i couldn't find a nice library for this, so this issue will serve as backlog and it will be appreciated if anyone has suggestions for this.
