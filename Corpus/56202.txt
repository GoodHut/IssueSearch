 URL : "https://github.com/e-/Hangul.js/issues/8" TITLE : missing complex vowels BODY : firstly, i'd like to thank you for putting to together and sharing this fantastic tool. hangul.assemble 'ㅅ','ㅓ','ㅣ' ; // results in '서 ㅣ' and not '세'. this issue concerns the following for 'hangul.assemble ': 'ㅏ,ㅣ' 'ㅓ,ㅣ' 'ㅗ,ㅏ,ㅣ' 'ㅘ,ㅣ' 'ㅜ,ㅓ,ㅣ' 'ㅝ,ㅣ' added these to the 'complex vowel' array might resolve this issue, however the triplets, e.g. 'ㅜ,ㅓ,ㅣ' might require this array to be completely reformatted. it seems like 'complex vowels' are only diphthongs and do not accommodate triphthongs.
