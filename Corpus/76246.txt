 URL : "https://github.com/ing-bank/baker/issues/54" TITLE : invalid v8 thread access BODY : hi baker team! i have just tried the latest release of baker 1.1.14 and have noticed one issue with compiledrecipe::getvisualrecipeassvg method. it looks like that because of graphviz-java this method can only be called from a single thread otherwise an exception is thrown: java.lang.error: invalid v8 thread access at com.eclipsesource.v8.v8locker.checkthread v8locker.java:56 at com.eclipsesource.v8.v8.checkthread v8.java:676 at com.eclipsesource.v8.v8.executestringscript v8.java:499 at com.eclipsesource.v8.v8.executestringscript v8.java:483 ... for now the workaround is to use smth like singlethreadexecutor and always call this method using it. but of course it would be nicer if you can handle it. kind regards, sergey ps: here https://github.com/eclipsesource/j2v8/issues/33 you can find some more information about this exception.
