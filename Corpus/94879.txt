sometimes when i'm scrolling through all my devrant notifications i end up scrolling through lots of ++'s thanks everyone! . perhaps it would be a nice idea to colour code them so that we can simply skim through and quickly see what's important. an example,
i see that i have 23 notifications, i click over to that tab, then i see notifications that are coloured due to their importance. maybe yellow for mentions, perhaps no highlight on ++'s, and it would be nice to have a blue tint on comments on your rant. - thoughts?
