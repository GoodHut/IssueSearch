 URL : "https://github.com/ofgulban/segmentator/issues/47" TITLE : gradient magnitude options BODY : gradient magnitude can be computed in several ways: - central differences in the interior and first differences at the boundaries, aka numpy.gradient https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.gradient.html - with sobel operator https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sobel_operator - with prewitt operator https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prewitt_operator we are currently using numpy.gradient but i am planning to change the default to sobel operator because it is less sensitive noise. changes are currently implemented in devel-arcweld branch.
