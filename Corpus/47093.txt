 URL : "https://github.com/bubasuma/yii2-simplechat/issues/20" TITLE : not able to configure BODY : are there any instructions for using this extension without twig? i have read everything, including closed and open issue for several times, and still not able to get this to work...only thing i managed to get is install everything through composer, but that is about it. i am guessing i need to make my own views since these ones are twig? is there any example of that?
