 URL : "https://github.com/artf/grapesjs/issues/136" TITLE : npm run build issue BODY : hi, i am really hoping someone can point me in the right direction. i need to make a couple of styling and functional changes to the core of grapesjs to cater for my requirements.. issue number 1: i am running npm run build . it gets to the webpack command and then fails with a error in ./dist/grapes.min.js from uglifyjs unexpectedtoken: punc ... now i am assuming this has something to do this converting the code to es5 for uglify to compile. any ideas what the issue could be. i haven't really altered the config file and i have installed babel babel-loader and the es2015 present, but it still seems to throw that error. issue number 2: if i comment out webpack.optimize.uglifyjsplugin from the plugins it finishes running, however the code i am left with doesn't seem correct. it has multiple references to __webpack_require__ and if i embed it on the web page i get that error that grapejs is not defined. my environment is: - windows 10. - nodejs 6.9.1 - npm 3.10.9 the help would be greatly appreciated.
