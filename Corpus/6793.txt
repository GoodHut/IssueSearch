 URL : "https://github.com/wackerl91/luna/issues/147" TITLE : can't add host. BODY : - luna version: luna 0.7.0-rc7 - nvidia geforce experience version: 3.4.0.70 - moonlight embedded version: 2.3.0 - osmc version: 2017.03-1 expected behaviour: getting the pair code after entering the ip to be entered on the host computer. actual behaviour: an exception occured.... after entering the ip of the host and then nothing else happens. no pair code or anything the the ip menu closes after clicking error and the error comes up after a couple of seconds. i create this issue for a friend of mine he's not very good at github stuff and he gets this weird error. i post on his behalf and will help him guide through any possible solutions. the error should have been reported to eos. i hope there are a workaround for this, we tried to get luna's inbuilt host pairer working but couldn't get python to work properly. thank you.
