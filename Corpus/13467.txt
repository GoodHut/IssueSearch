 URL : "https://github.com/cooler-SAI/MopCore547/issues/26" TITLE : upgrade to 5.4.8 BODY : its really annoying that we have to use only the wow.exe file from here and force our users to use our file only. and of course we have some other problems such as the character screen don't reload on character creations which i think is related to opcodes. so is there any plan to fix this issue ?
