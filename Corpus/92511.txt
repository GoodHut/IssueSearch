 URL : "https://github.com/Telerik-Verified-Plugins/HealthKit/issues/85" TITLE : xcode build failure 0.5.3 BODY : xcode build fails showing errors in plugins/com.telerik.plugins.healthkit/healthkit.m file. the issue is stable on my environment, reproduces on every build. com.telerik.plugins.healthkit@0.5.1 works just fine. here's the snippet with the error: 1 import healthkit.h 2 import hkhealthstore+aaplextensions.h 3 import workoutac 4 __block healthkit dp = self; 5 tivityconversion.h obviously, the __block healthkit dp = self; line should not be there. it's absent in the healthkit.m from plugin sources. i'm not sure how it gets added, probably cordova makes some internal code transformations. environment: - com.telerik.plugins.healthkit v0.5.3 - cordova v6.5.0 - cordova-ios v.4.3.1 - xcode v8.2.1
