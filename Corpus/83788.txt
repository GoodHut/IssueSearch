 URL : "https://github.com/mnapoli/fluent-symfony/issues/3" TITLE : closure factories support BODY : i use something similar to your component in my internal project, i.e. we have configuration loader which mimics yaml syntax of the di component. i made such a decision for the same reasons as you described in the readme ::class , constants, etc. . however, it is pain in ass that there is no easy way to utilize closures in such configs for factories: php return 'services' => 'logger' => 'class' => logger::class, 'factory' => function string $logfilename { $logger = new legacyfileloggerwithsetterinjection ; $logger->setfile $logfilename ; return $logger; }, 'arguments' => '%log_filename%' ; from technical point of view, it is possible to implement it for context-free closures: without $this and without use statement otherwise you won't be able to compile it . unfortunately, it's hard to do it without changing the core phpdumper my attempt to bring this feature into the core failed in the past: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/12115, https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/11953 . it would be great if you could find some way to implement the feature.
