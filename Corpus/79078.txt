 URL : "https://github.com/wind-python/windpowerlib/issues/4" TITLE : review of actual version BODY : 1. the windpowerlib use some of pvlib's concepts. i like it because it makes it easier for energy system modellers to understand the concept. could you therefore rename the modelchain to modelchain . 2. i would use the text from oemof for the installation. if you have a working python3 environment, use pypi to install the latest oemof version. pip install oemof so far, the windpowerlib is mainly tested on python 3.4 but seems to work down to 2.7 and for newer versions. please see the installation page of the oemof documentation for complete instructions on how to install python on your operating system. 3. i liked the basic usage section from the old documentation. i would at least add an how to use the modelchain to the documentation.
