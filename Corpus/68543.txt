 URL : "https://github.com/XaserAcheron/argent/issues/71" TITLE : sbarinfo doesn't update BODY : if you change the bfg ammotype cvar mid-map, the effects intentionally do not take effect until map-change. but when you do, sbarinfo still shows the previous ammotype on the hud unless you drop+pickup the weapon again. welp! this is frankly probably a sbarinfo bug. just logging it here so i remember to bugreport it at some point.
