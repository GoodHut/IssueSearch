 URL : "https://github.com/Black-Sphere-Studios/feathergui/issues/16" TITLE : wide color gamut support BODY : currently, feathergui simply stores all colors in a standard 32-bit integer. switching this to a 64-bit integer would allow encoding higher precision color spaces for monitors that support this. the new android api has specifications https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/color.html for encoding various color spaces inside a 64-bit integer. because feathergui's fgcolor is already defined as a type, it would be fairly trivial to extend the type into a 64-bit integer with functions for converting between color spaces. for sanity reasons, a default color space would need to be chosen as the base representation handed to the backend. this could theoretically be specified by the backend itself, in the same way the backend currently specifies a default text representation.
