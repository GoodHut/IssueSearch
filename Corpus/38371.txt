 URL : "https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db/issues/239" TITLE : peerpad and orbit-db BODY : peerpad https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/peerpad i would like to understand these two projects more so the ipfs-shipyard projects use http://y-js.org/ for the crdt and orbit-db has its own? orbit-db is a database build on top of ipfs. they both use ipfs pubsub? i am a bit confused so i would like to understand why we have two projects build on top of ipfs. maybe someone can clarify the needs for 2 projects üëç sry for asking so many questions
