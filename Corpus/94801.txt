 URL : "https://github.com/caccavale/joka/issues/2" TITLE : client spawning is archaic BODY : really need to clean up client spawning / make some convenience functions for those of us who don't much care for passing around empty strings. maybe make the init function take in the variable required to spawn and then have spawnclient read those; create a controller kind of environment. otherwise just make some simpler functions.
