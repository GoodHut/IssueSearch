 URL : "https://github.com/rails-oceania/melbourne-ruby/issues/58" TITLE : code forensics analysis BODY : this is a presentation/demonstration talk about alternative techniques to analyse large codebases and detect potential issues with software design or code quality. i'm going demo the use of code-forensics https://github.com/smontanari/code-forensics as applied to our rails monolith in redbubble and how it is helping us to address the growing technical debt. the work is inspired by the book your code as a crime scene by adam tornhill. the talk is for all levels and my purpose is to get more people interested and engaged in using code-forensics to make it a complementary instrument next to more traditional static code analysis tools. 20~30 mins
