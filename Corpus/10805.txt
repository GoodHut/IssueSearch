 URL : "https://github.com/khcnz/Espressif2Arduino/issues/11" TITLE : dio / dout / qio BODY : the defines for respective public images are: define url_qio_rom_2 http://sunlocker.khc.net.nz/static/8266/e2a-1024-2.bin define url_qio_rom_3 http://sunlocker.khc.net.nz/static/8266/sonoff-1024.bin define url_dio_rom_2 http://sunlocker.khc.net.nz/static/8285/e2a-1024-2.bin define url_dio_rom_3 http://sunlocker.khc.net.nz/static/8285/sonoff-1024.bin which suggests dio is used by esp8285 afaik wrong and qio by esp8266 afaik semi-wrong . esp8266 can be flashed using dio/qio - where 'd' stands for 'dual' flash is wired with 2 cables and 'q' for 'quad' flash is wire with 4 cables . as far as i know in sonoffs the flash is wired with 2 cables i might be wrong here so qio for the sonoffs wouldn't make sense. for the esp8285 dout / qout are used instead of dio/qio however since the flash is built-in, you shouldn't have much choice, however i'm uncertain whether it's wired internally by 2 or 4 . from my understanding esps being abled to flash via q and always also be flashed by its respective d method. while out and io are significantly different and that's what makes the difference in terms of flashing for esp8285 and esp8266. as you see i'm not sure in several points myself, however i'm pretty sure the names of the defines lead to false implications both using io .
