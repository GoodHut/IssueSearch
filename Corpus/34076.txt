 URL : "https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues/3750" TITLE : bug in schema regex? BODY : general.xsd contains a file matching component in a regex: <xs:pattern value= program:|preference:|settings:|home:|profile:|file:| a-za-z :|\/ \/|\\| ^/? :;{}\\ + +|https?:\/\/.+\/?. /> xmllint throws a parse error on this though xml validation in jmri is apparently silently accepting it it claims there's a missing escape \ after the ^ and before the /? see a test parse, including an extra \, at https://regex101.com/r/xt7yd8/73
