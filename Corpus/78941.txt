 URL : "https://github.com/garethpdx/blog/issues/6" TITLE : replace with static site BODY : there's not really much need for a server-side component to this project. the only things that's really getting us right now is comments and non-published articles. so far the only use of comments has been for spambots to talk to each other. so they can go the way of the dodo. non-published articles are useful when an article takes a while to write. but there's no reason these wip articles be deployed with the published articles, and just omitted from the index.
