 URL : "https://github.com/Montana-Media-Arts/341-work/issues/49" TITLE : week 8 images not working BODY : this is weird, but i was just poking around my repositories and i noticed my images aren't working in the live version of my week 8 assignment. they were working when i turned it in, and they're working in the live preview of the site, but not the actual live website. i tried some stuff with the code, but nothing is helping. any ideas?
