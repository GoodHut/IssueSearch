 URL : "https://github.com/jianC/android_p6601/issues/1" TITLE : thanks for your work BODY : hi, many thanks for your work! i've been trying to clean up vampirefo's tree and build lineageos for r1 hd too, and it would be nice if we could work together : i've fixed a few stuff on https://github.com/zhaofengli/android_device_blu_p6601, with a minimal set of patches for the rom to at least boot on the device. those can be applied cleanly on an unmodified lineageos tree. by the way, i couldn't get the kernel to work, so i used the boot.img from vampirefo's build.
