 URL : "https://github.com/getsentry/raven-node/issues/331" TITLE : breadcrumbs in raven BODY : hi, i am using raven in my openerp project to log to sentry. during this, i have observed that the breadcrumbs limit cannot be set by the client through the api. i can only enable_breadcrumbs or disable them. i would like to log breadcrumbs for error only. to summarise, i am looking forward to: 1. set the limit for number of breadcrumbs from client. 2. to log breadcrumbs for specific log levels. below is additional information: i have gone through the raven package and understood that we are getting breadcrumbs if below statement is true- insert breadcrumbs if self.enable_breadcrumbs: also breadcrumbs limit is set to 100, in breadcrumbs.py that can't be changed by client. please let me know if we have a workflow to get these items through the api else, can these changes be provided in your upcoming releases. thanks, prasantarmaye
