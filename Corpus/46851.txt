 URL : "https://github.com/gartnera/headunit/issues/84" TITLE : mzd native resolution BODY : i've noticed that it seems like android auto doesn't run at the native resolution of the mzd system lcd panel making things like text seem blurred. i've checked the code and found this in outputs.cpp _ if aspect_ratio_fix axis-left=0 axis-top=-20 disp-width=800 disp-height=520 else axis-left=0 axis-top=0 disp-width=800 disp-height=480 endif max-lateness=1000000000 sync=false async=false ;_ it seems the native resolution is 800x480. aspect_ratio_fix is set to true in another class. 20 is being deducted off the top, so only 20 needs to be added to fill up the screen right? seems like 40 is being added in which would cause the app to run 20 pixels too tall. anybody know why 40 was added instead of just the 20? chris
