 URL : "https://github.com/dimoto95/macspoofer/issues/1" TITLE : some minor notes BODY : 1 on line 16, newmac= echo ${vendorbytes}:${nonvendorbytes} there is no need to echo 2 also the script needs root privileges so, either the commands will run with sudo, or the entire script will be run by root there can be checks for the user that runs it, and exit if it is the wrong one . good job.
