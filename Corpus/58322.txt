BODY : hello, first of all, thanks for this theme, an excellent starting point! i just started an other project that should be multilingual : fr - nl so, since the install came in english, my first move is to set fr or nl as default language. so, i went to 'wp settings > general > site language dropdown' - unfortunately only 'english united states ' is available. yet i read about translation ready. did i miss something? 1. should i do anything to populate the site language dropdown? i try by setting - define 'wplang', 'fr_fr' ; - in wp-config.php too. 2. should the languages folder in the folder be moved to /wp-content/languages/ ? 3. wondering if the french and dutch translations are ready to use? i found this https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-themes/understrap but few languages seems completed. i could help for french. thanks by advance.
