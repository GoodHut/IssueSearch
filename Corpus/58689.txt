 URL : "https://github.com/mapseed/platform/issues/655" TITLE : static site conversion BODY : updates/additions/thoughts to this issue welcome! converting mapseed from a dynamically rendered site dependent on django to a static site would have performance and deployment benefits, and is an important step on the road to being able to offer mapseed as a service. to migrate to a static site, we'd need to accomplish the following: - extend base.html with content in flavor index.html files one possible approach here would be to rebuild all html templates as handlebars templates, then use handlebars partials to insert flavor-specific content - find a replacement for django's localization system possibilities here include creating separate static bundles for different languages, or loading localized content dynamically from a microservice - replicating the proxy functionality found in views.py client-side a natural place for this functionality would be in the routes.js file
