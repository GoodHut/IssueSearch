 URL : "https://github.com/gotthardp/lorawan-server/issues/136" TITLE : can't make multicast work BODY : hello, i wanted to try multicast but i didn't succeed to make it work. i tried to send this: { data : 4546 , port :2, time : immediately } through mqtt topic, the lorawan-server detect it and send the data to the gateway but the gateway can't send the message because of missing field. indeed, when i checked the log, i saw that the coding rate is set to 0 in the data sent to the gateway when i set 4/5 in the server. moreover, i don't know if it is a bug or done on purpose but i can't use the 869.525 mhz frequency with the channel field. currently, the frequencies we can use with the lorawan server for europe are: channel / frequency 0 -> 868.1 1 -> 868.3 2 -> 868.5 3 -> 867.7 4 -> 867.9 5 -> 868.1 6 -> 868.3 7 -> 868.5 8 -> 868.8 thanks, julien.
