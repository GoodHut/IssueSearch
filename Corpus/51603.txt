 URL : "https://github.com/lmco/laikaboss/issues/65" TITLE : automated docker build BODY : would it be helpful to the community to setup an automated docker build for the project? https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/ i suspect the owner of the repo would be the best person to create a special github account with access to this repo that links both the docker automated build and the repo. that way it's not reliant on a community member that may or may not keep up with it.
