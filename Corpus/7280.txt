 URL : "https://github.com/mephux/i3-gnome/issues/3" TITLE : fail, not found BODY : hi! i'm struggling to get this working, maybe you could point out if i am missing something? i installed the aur package i3-gnome-git , and the session effectively appears on the greeter, but when launched it does not work, it crashes and goes back to the greeter. this is the result from .xsession-errors /etc/lightdm/xsession: line 76: exec: gnome-session --session=i3-gnome: not found gdk-message: light-locker: fatal io error 11 resource temporarily unavailable on x server :0. i am using antergos with lightdm 1:1.24.0-1 gnome-shell 3.26.1 i3-wm 4.14.1-2 my best guess is that there is some component failing to initialize. also the gdk-message seems weird to me. thanks in advance!
