 URL : "https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExtreme/issues/494" TITLE : dxform and rails BODY : i am experimenting with rails and devextreme. rails, by default, is expecting name attributes of input elements to be like model field for example name= article caption . at the moment, dxform items ignores name for an item if there is datafield specified, and if formdata contains keys like model field - binding is broken. is it possible to force name of generated input element in dxform? environment details: devextreme 17.1
