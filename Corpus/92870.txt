 URL : "https://github.com/PsychoLlama/mytosis/issues/33" TITLE : ability to stream database BODY : currently there's no way to stream the contents of the whole database. here's why you'd need to do that: - discovery for data dashboards - migration to other persistence engines or servers - data migrations here's the idea: mytosis interface js async => { // uses an async generator to represent the value stream. for await const key, value of db { console.log 'found node:', key } } plugin interface js class storageplugin { // pseudo code stuff async symbol.asynciterator { const stream = this.createreadstream while !stream.closed { yield await stream.once 'data' } } } advantages: - language-standard asynchronous data streams with much easier error handling - queries can be lazily evaluated - encourages plugins to export query utilities perhaps this iterator is just a boundless query disadvantages: - as of this writing, async generators are very new. it adds to the bundle size - requires non-trivial knowledge of the language
