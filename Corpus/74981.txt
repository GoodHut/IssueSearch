 URL : "https://github.com/athombv/org.upnp/issues/8" TITLE : force re-scan of devices BODY : i think homey is supposed to automatically rescans for network-devices once every 5 minutes https://github.com/athombv/org.upnp/blob/master/node_modules/upnp-device-client/index.js l15 but this doesn't always seem to work still trying to replicate . but, to be able to control our devices, it would be good to have an action-card to force a rescan after a device is turned on.
