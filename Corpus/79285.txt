 URL : "https://github.com/jstockwin/EpiEstimApp/issues/80" TITLE : seeds for preloaded data BODY : when using pre-loaded data, the data is saved after the mcmc run, so setting the seed will not change this. there are basically two options: - have a big warning explaining that this is what happens - save mcmc output for say 10 different seeds - run mcmc even when using preloaded data @annecori and @jstockwin think the first option and @robin-thompson things the second might be better. we need to work out what to do about this. we could potentially ask the question specifically do you want to choose mcmc params etc yourself, or just use our pre-run mcmc output? . this might be a bit of a pain to code, though.
