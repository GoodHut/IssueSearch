 URL : "https://github.com/mentdotio/ment.io/issues/2" TITLE : add jwt support BODY : honestly i'm not sure if sessions or jwt's are the way to go -- there's so much back and forth on both sides. the passport-jwt https://github.com/themikenicholson/passport-jwt library seems top notch, and a lot of people are using it currently with postgraphile, for the sake of aligning for community efforts, why not try it out? follow https://github.com/postgraphql/postgraphql/issues/562 for discussion of using passport. ready postgraphile's jwt guide https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/jwt-guide/ for their recommendations and practices.
