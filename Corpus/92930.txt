 URL : "https://github.com/bakery/react-native-navigation-redux-helpers/issues/10" TITLE : action to add child routes BODY : suppose think this is the initialroute. { key: 'main', index: 0, routes: { key: 'home', index: 0, routes: { key: 'list' }, { key: 'detail' } }, { key: 'cart' }, { key: 'proceed' } }; is there a way to append a new entry to homeroutes, maybe like this.props.dispatch push {key: 'test1'}, this.props.navigation.routes 0 .key ; ? my idea was to do a nested navigation.
