 URL : "https://github.com/KaimingHe/deep-residual-networks/issues/52" TITLE : preprocessing tf vs caffe BODY : hello, i'm working on a transfer learning project using resnet-50 as implemented in keras.applications with the tensorflow backend. i've found scarce little documentation on the preprocessing for images to feed into the net. i've found and hopefully i am correct that for the caffe model, it's bgr and mean subtracted across feature dimensions for imagenet mean , but when i look at the preprocess function in keras, it seems that for 'tensor flow' mode, the channels are rgb and normalized differently -1,1 without subtracting the imagenet mean. i've found this discrepancy very confusing, but attribute it to the tf and caffe resnet-50 models being trained on imagenet but with different preprocessing functions. any clarity here would be highly appreciated. regards, aaron long
