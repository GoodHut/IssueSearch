 URL : "https://github.com/optune/meteor-auth0-oauth/issues/1" TITLE : implementation with lock BODY : hi newbie over here , sorry to raise an issue as it is more of a question: i don't understand how to link your code to lock in react native from what i understood - auth0_server is used to manage the user creation within meteor user account - auth0_client is used to provide a front end endpoint for a client to connect like lock --> is it correct? so now i use lock with this code... const lock = new auth0lock {clientid: 'xx', domain: 'xx.auth0.com'}, { auth:{ redirecturl: 'http://192.168.0.12:3000/_oauth/auth0', responsetype: 'code', params: { scope: 'openid email' // learn about scopes: https://auth0.com/docs/scopes } } } ; ...but even though the auth0 connection works great i don't create my user in meteor backend : i don't know if my redirecturl is good nor if my params are good... can you give me a hint on how to do that? thanks for your help
