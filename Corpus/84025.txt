 URL : "https://github.com/Overv/Open.GL/issues/57" TITLE : context settings for sfml BODY : sfml 2.3+ supports using core profile and even the opengl version can be requested. for me, using the simple contextsettings instance given in the articles only creates a 3.0 context with shaders supported upto 130 only. although, everything in the series still works after just downgrading the version at the top, it'd be much better if the context settings were explicitly given to allow opengl 3+ features. the following code is sufficient: sf::contextsettings settings; settings.depthbits = 24; settings.stencilbits = 8; settings.antialiasinglevel = 2; settings.majorversion = 3; settings.minorversion = 2; settings.attributeflags = sf::contextsettings::core;
