 URL : "https://github.com/EpicEricEE/ShopChest/issues/107" TITLE : remove shop if empty BODY : hello, first of all thank you for the awesome plugin! in my server we have a market and it frequently happens that it runs out of free chests due to players not removing or refilling them. it would be really interesting to have an option to automatically remove a shop when it is out of supplies maybe after a certain time . thanks again.
