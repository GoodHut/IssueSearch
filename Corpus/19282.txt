 URL : "https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/issues/16569" TITLE : 4.0 session count? BODY : spotted by @coolcat-creations at jab17 and confirmed now by me after some time working on testing j4 which might include closing and reopening the browser and/or having a session timeout and being forced to llog back in the count of the number of admins just keeps increasing see below for the screenshots of a few hours using both j3 and j4 - the count only goes up in 4 personally i am convinced there is some bug in 4 as i am being logged out much more often than i was in 3 but @wilsonge said there was no issue <img width= 336 alt= screenshotr16-56-15 src= https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1296369/26885315-3ca123ee-4b9a-11e7-9c47-c91c40dfa60a.png > <img width= 260 alt= screenshotr16-56-23 src= https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1296369/26885317-3cc7c878-4b9a-11e7-883d-e19c58522471.png >
