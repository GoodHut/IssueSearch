 URL : "https://github.com/jmwright/cqcad/issues/22" TITLE : finish python code editor BODY : right now the editor window is just an extended qplaintextedit widget. the functionality needs to start being laid out to make it a usable editor. line numbers http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwidgets-widgets-codeeditor-example.html syntax highlighting http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwidgets-richtext-syntaxhighlighter-example.html code completion http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwidgets-tools-customcompleter-example.html proper tab handling tabs to spaces, set variable number in settings, etc in addition to those things, the settings.py https://github.com/jmwright/cadquery-freecad-module/blob/master/settings.py file from cqfm should be consulted for other settings that users have asked for. it is anticipated that the code editor will have hooks that allow it and the 3d view to be linked so that hybrid script-mouse functionality can be enabled.
