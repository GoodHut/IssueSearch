 URL : "https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate/issues/1202" TITLE : get root path of the app BODY : i'm having some trouble looking for the app root directory of the boilerplate on production or package mode. i'm using the file-loader for some json files. i can't use json-loader because the files are huge. i have no trouble on dev, because webpack gives the file on the dev-sever with http://localhost . however in production the files are server on the app.asar. is there any way i can get the root directory of the app?
