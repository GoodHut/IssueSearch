 URL : "https://github.com/openml/openml-python/issues/257" TITLE : string feature support BODY : hi, this is more a question than a bug report. i tried downloading dataset 40748 that includes sting features and i get this error: file /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/openml-0.3.0-py2.7.egg/openml/datasets/dataset.py , line 197, in get_data raise pyopenmlerror 'dataset not compatible, pyopenml cannot handle string features' openml.exceptions.pyopenmlerror: dataset not compatible, pyopenml cannot handle string features given that arff module that is used internally already supports string features is it planned to add support for text datasets to openml-python?
