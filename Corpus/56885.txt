 URL : "https://github.com/jmeas/api-pls/issues/108" TITLE : organize lib directory BODY : previously, i was just throwing things into util pretty randomly. i basically thought, would i conceivably use this thing again? yes, alright in you go. now that i'm rethinking about lib, i think each of the folders in there should be a method in the programmatic interface 106 . everything else should be a util within those method folders. with this in mind, i should be able to do some reorganization in there.
