 URL : "https://github.com/jasonLaster/ship2gecko/issues/2" TITLE : update the readme.md BODY : a good evolution for this would be to add the actual link to the debugger commit on github. even better would be to have a link to the compare view between this commit and the previous release commit. finally this information could also be added to the commit message this way people who don't know about this file could still get the information easily.
