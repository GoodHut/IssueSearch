 URL : "https://github.com/alimanfoo/zarr/issues/149" TITLE : tables - requirements BODY : this issue is a placeholder for gathering thoughts and discussion on requirements for storage of columnar tables a la bcolz . the idea is to explore how the functionalities available in zarr and bcolz might be brought together. this is not necessarily something that will happen in zarr, just a discussion at this stage. requirements below is a list of possible requirements. if you have any thoughts or comments on the requirements, please add a comment below, including if requirements should be non-requirements e.g., if the requirement can be achieved by using zarr with dask . store data from a pandas dataframe without loss. load data into a pandas dataframe without loss. store data from a numpy recarray without loss. load data into a numpy recarray without loss. play well with dask.dataframe. e.g., it should be possible to write a from_zarr function into dask.dataframe, which would allow out-of-core dask computations against the zarr stored data. append a single row. append multiple rows as a block. iterate over rows. iterate over rows matching a query. evaluate an expression against columns e.g., a + b c . parallel query not sure what this means ? parallel append not sure what this means ?
