 URL : "https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk/issues/747" TITLE : dynamic tests for schema BODY : as we are using json-schema library which is returning error messages in the specified format we could automate writing unit tests in every place where a schema is being tested - all api endpoints functions. a schema check can fail when following: - a function is called with an argument of the wrong type - a function is called with object type as expected, but nested parameters of it are in incorrect format - a function is called without required parameters expected behavior set of tests is being generated to check a schema current behavior schema tests are being created manually, which can lead to overlooking of some test cases, is more time consuming and less readable by making test files extremely large
