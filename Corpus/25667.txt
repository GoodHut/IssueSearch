 URL : "https://github.com/nathancahill/Split.js/issues/84" TITLE : a complete example? BODY : hi. this looks very very cool, not to mention useful. i can't get even the simplest example to work though, so i suspect i'm missing a vital part. would it be possible to add a complete working example with both html and js and any necessary css ? to elaborate my situation; i simply have two div's with id's contained in another div with an id, all in a vanilla html page. i import split.js through unpkg and execute split ' id-1', ' id-2' , {minwidth:50} in a script tag in the bottom of my <body> i can confirm that the split method is called as a gutter is added to the markup. the result is invisible, though.
