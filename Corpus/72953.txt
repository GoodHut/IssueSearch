 URL : "https://github.com/jeancochrane/chano4mayor/issues/14" TITLE : clean up the repository! BODY : @jeancochrane @beamalsky can you two make sure you have everything that's in progress saved locally either in another folder or excluded https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/ explicit-repository-excludes . i want to remove anything from the repo that's not actually used for the site and use google drive to share those things instead, so we can avoid any unnecessary headaches from directory case etc. in the future.
