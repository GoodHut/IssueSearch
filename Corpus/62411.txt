 URL : "https://github.com/conan-io/conan/issues/1826" TITLE : cmd refactor export-pkg BODY : same package_files functionality but: - remove the copy all this folder use case. it's needed to declare a package method with a copy to keep the old behavior. - --package_folder won't longer exist - it will perform automatically an export, the path by default, like the export command, will look for a conanfile.py in the current directory or the specified path . if a path is specified, and no conanfile is found, launch an error. if default and no conanfile is found, do not export again will fail if the recipe doesn't exist in the local cache . intended to package multiple times in a script. - reference, complete or partial, like exports - --source_folder , --build_folder will be kept
