 URL : "https://github.com/dolanmiu/MMM-awesome-alexa/issues/28" TITLE : the guides are wrong..... BODY : following this for manual creation: https://miguelmota.com/blog/alexa-voice-service-authentication/ does not take you anywhere near the pages as described on the webpage.... perhaps there's a more clear explanation for this? using your page results in errors -> https://magic-mirror-avs.github.io/alexa-web-helper/ so is there a new updated guide to install this? thank you
