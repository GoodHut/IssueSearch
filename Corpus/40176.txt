 URL : "https://github.com/linuxdeepin/dde-dock/issues/62" TITLE : the dock to be clean BODY : currently the status and plugins icons are placed in the dock, which makes it full of icons. i think that ideally an interface should only show what's needed in the very moment, or constantly, and hide everything else. so changeovers https://www.leanproduction.com/smed.html are as fast as possible. since status and plugin icons are only used punctually, i suspect they would be better placed somewhere inside the launcher. and the launcher icon differentiated from the rest of icons.
