 URL : "https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/17609" TITLE : bug - remove unused usings BODY : try this, write some simple code that compiles but use int rather than int etc. then hover mouse over the usings and you'll see it is happy to remove system if there are no other uses of it . however doing that and committing the code can cause build errors because int, etc are defined in system and it should not consider system safe to remove if the code contains any of these type aliases. this caused a build to break recently because developer assumed it is always safe to remove unused usings.
