 URL : "https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/issues/143" TITLE : white blobs in highlights BODY : i apologize at the start for my lack of knowledge and amateurism in visual machine learning. after running some test images through a model i trained, i get white blobs in some of the highlights. they wouldn't be so bad if they didn't have such a hard edge. is anyone aware of settings that could be changed in training/testing options to combat this? i don't know what additional info would be helpful, but am happy to pass along anything. thank you so much in advance! ! 4t8a7133_fake_b https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4666339/32406360-0c19e3c0-c145-11e7-8547-468fffe97f07.png ! 4t8a7145_fake_b https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4666339/32406361-0c2becfa-c145-11e7-9e78-66e4f45b0195.png
