 URL : "https://github.com/DiUS/pact_broker-docker/issues/32" TITLE : turn on basic auth? BODY : i've had a look through this repo and the actual broker repo and can't seem to find instructions to turn on basic auth and set the credentials. i am guessing its going to be something to do with pact_broker/config.ru ?
