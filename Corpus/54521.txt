 URL : "https://github.com/open-contracting/standard-development-handbook/issues/49" TITLE : github: issue workflow BODY : 1. i see a pattern of closing one issue and then opening a nearly identical issue. this is problematic because: new participants need to diligently read all issues referencing the new issue to rebuild the context. old participants aren't notified of activity on the new issue, and need to diligently subscribe to it. if the old issue is closed in favor of a new issue, but the new issue is not resolved but is closed for whatever reason, like too little interest , a reader of the old issue may assume that the new issue is either open or resolved. they would need to follow the chain to realize that it's unresolved and closed, before adding a comment to say actually i'm interested! . basically, it adds a lot of friction, and i don't see what the advantage is except perhaps for users who are intimately familiar with the entire history of issues, but that is nearly no one . 2. i also occasionally see issues closed without a comment about the closure. issues should be closed with a brief rationale e.g. resolved in above commit if there's a commit referencing the issue that appears nearby, or resolved in this extension with a link to the extension that was created, or closing, because explanation . the comment makes it much easier to understand what happened and affords participants an opportunity to engage with the rationale. i'm very likely to re-open issues if i can't understand why they were closed. i've gone through all issues that were closed in 2017 and added comments explaining their closure where it wasn't immediately obvious, and i opened those where it seemed like the issue was unresolved and in need of resolution.
