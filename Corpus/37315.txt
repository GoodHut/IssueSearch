 URL : "https://github.com/ucam-cl-dtg/isaac-app/issues/807" TITLE : log user role change BODY : we should definitely log when a user's role changes to the logged events table, probably with key user_role_change . we may want to use this information to follow up new teacher accounts and that sort of thing, so it may be sensible to store a teacher_since field in the user object too? both things could be straightforwardly added to the useraccountmanager https://github.com/ucam-cl-dtg/isaac-api/blob/master/src/main/java/uk/ac/cam/cl/dtg/segue/api/managers/useraccountmanager.java l739-l748 . we'd need to check that you couldn't set the field yourself if we added it to the user object.
