 URL : "https://github.com/TheRosettaFoundation/SOLAS-Match-Backend/issues/47" TITLE : create organisation button BODY : we just realised that the create organisation button has disappeared from all the non-admin profiles. for example, @paulina-rosetta can see it from her admin account, but not from her volunteer standard account. the one in the screenshot is a profile of an organisation who is just registered as a volunteer because they can't go any further. thanks! stefania ! create organisation button https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/22887100/22058699/c9a3758c-dd61-11e6-8248-2050722e8913.png
