 URL : "https://github.com/Bionus/imgbrd-grabber/issues/1018" TITLE : automatically create and BODY : note that i'm running arch. this is the only application i know where you have to manually copy some files to your home folder in order to get persistent settings storage according to the wiki . it shouldn't have to be this way. 1. configuration should, by default, be stored in $xdg_config_home/grabber or, as a fallback, in $home/.config/grabber not $home/.grabber . 2. the required configuration file, settings.ini , should be created and saved to automatically by the application and not require user interaction. 3. optional load other resource files from this configuration dir if they exist, otherwise fall back to installation default platform-dependant . i don't know how this is implemented for windows. from how things are dealt with currently, it appears this is mostly designed as a portable application, saving configuration and stuff in adjacent paths, while still having workarounds for installations in program files, which requires admin privileges to write. i suggest to implement a proper portable mode and a default mode, where configuration is read from a user-specific configuration directory, much like i suggested for linux systems. on windows, that would be %appdata%\grabber . btw, 1012 isn't on the master branch yet, which is why everyone installing this from the aur cannot have their settings saved, regardless of whether ~/.grabber/settings.ini exists.
