 URL : "https://github.com/markasoftware/SpecDB/issues/13" TITLE : windows build support BODY : add support for building on windows so it is easier for the filthy windows users to contribute, as fucked up as that may sound. main thing that needs to be done is a batch equivalent of build/build.bash . looked into batsh but doesn't seem sufficient no way to get command line args, no redirection, etc .
