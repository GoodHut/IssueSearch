 URL : "https://github.com/ac2cz/FoxTelem/issues/403" TITLE : rssi wod graph BODY : the wod graph always has labelled on the x-axis uptime and utc rather than uptime and resets even when uptime is selected. worse, when you switch to next display mode or range display mode it asks for the utc time, not the uptime. i think this is tied in with the previous issue, when switching from utc to uptime.
