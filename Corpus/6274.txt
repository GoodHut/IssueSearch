 URL : "https://github.com/manjaro/pacman-mirrors/issues/81" TITLE : a scripting api BODY : one packager @udeved has sent a wish for some kind of scripting api. can it be done without confusing end users with a never ending list of options and arguments? e.g. an api to manipulate branch - though this is very close to the -b argument all that needs to be done is write it to pacman-mirrors.conf. reverse is even easier since this is default behavior - reading the branch from pacman-mirrors.conf and generating the mirrorlist accordingly.
