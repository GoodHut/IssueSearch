BODY : hi, i'm trying to use pragmas in my sqlite interactions. i am invoking rust try! conn.execute pragma synchronous = off; , & ; try! conn.execute pragma journal_mode = off; , & ; however, these lines fail with the error: error: execute returned results - did you mean to call query? . should i be calling query ? if so, i can't figure out from sqlite's docs what the return value is that i should be expecting. thank you for your help in using this library correctly!
