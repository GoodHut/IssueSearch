 URL : "https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/issues/334" TITLE : legacy opengl support BODY : field report, we had everything working briefly on an old apple powerbook g4 running debian 8. only real issue that i can see is limited opengl support. it has an ati card that only has opengl 2 something. but hey! it works! awesome! if you do drop support for earlier versions of opengl, please at least leave a backward compatible version available. thanks
