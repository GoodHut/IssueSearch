 URL : "https://github.com/jt3k/chat-linker/issues/28" TITLE : better xmpp integration BODY : current implementation uses single account to send all messages. i propose changing this behaviour by using multiple connections into a single conference in xmpp with resources matching telegram user names. e.g. js@c.j.r/username so if you have a chat of user1, user2, user3 you should join javascript@conferences.domain.tld three times with nicknames and from resources of /user1, /user2, /user3 and send messages from appropriate resource. on a nick collision add some prefix or suffix. later this may be reworked to create a service when the bot can link two chatroom of different networks by a user command.
