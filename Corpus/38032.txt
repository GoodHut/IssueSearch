 URL : "https://github.com/Vavassor/Tusky/issues/39" TITLE : no longer on f-droid BODY : the author requested for this app to be removed https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/issues/638 on f-droid. inclusion of non-free services prevents some users from installing the app. personally, i don't even have google play installed on my phone at all. hoping you will reconsider this, as everyone is willing to use free software but many people aren't willing to use nonfree software. thank you!
