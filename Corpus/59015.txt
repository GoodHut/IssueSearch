 URL : "https://github.com/davidtheclark/focus-trap/issues/29" TITLE : tab issue in edge/ie11 BODY : i am having an issue on edge and ie11 where pressing tab is not cycling the focus around the elements in the focus trap as it does in other browsers. it doesn't move focus outside of the focus trap, but remains at the last element. going back works fine until it gets to the first focusable item in the focus trap and then it won't cycle to the last. i am just wondering if it is possible that i am doing something wrong for it to do this? as i said, it works fine in firefox, chrome, and safari. thanks!
