 URL : "https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/issues/2973" TITLE : icon gif bad resolution BODY : resolution issues for icon we recently switched to react navigation. we are using the same icons png for unselected/gif for selected like in our own old custom tabbar component. in the react-navigation the resolution for the gif is quite poor, however. the tabbar is not displaying them with their full potential. is this on purpose? we would have hoped that we could control the quality of the gifs ourselves thanks in advance. tabbaricon: { focused } => focused ? <image source={require '../../images/nameoficon.gif' } style={styles.icon} /> : <image source={require '../../images/nameoficon.png' } style={styles.icon} /> icon: { height: 35, width: 35, }, | software | version | ---------------- | ------- | react-navigation | ^1.0.0-beta.15 | react-native | 0.49.3 | node | v6.11.0 | npm or yarn | v0.24.5
