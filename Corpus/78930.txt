 URL : "https://github.com/justinludwig/jpgpj/issues/6" TITLE : replace j-u-l with slf4j BODY : great library - one minor suggestion - the code uses j-u-l java.util.logging - _slf4j_ is widely used in most frameworks and seems a more natural choice. if you really want to make this optimal, provide a pluggable logging manager with default implementations for j-u-l, _slf4j_ and _log4j_.
