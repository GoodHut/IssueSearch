 URL : "https://github.com/hneemann/Digital/issues/44" TITLE : issues with rom component BODY : in attributes dialog address bit size takes effect after closing dialog. that is confusing when edit is used before closing the dialog. before the edit button opens the data dialog a message box should allow the user to accept the current setting. can not work with 32 address bits. only one line of the memory is shown in data dialog. with data bits 25 and address bits 25 edit do not open the data dialog. the data dialog shows only 6 chars per cell. so working with data bit sizes greater 24 is a pain. each time the data dialog is opened the column size of the interested cells have to be changed manually.
