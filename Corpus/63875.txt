 URL : "https://github.com/yogstation13/yogstation/issues/2307" TITLE : extended is screwed up. BODY : there's no admin logging or anything. if you late join, there's no way to easily see what the crew objective is. sounds pretty simple to just add it to the check-antags verb. the bsa is screwed up somehow, it seems. people report it being unable to fire, thus never getting the objective done. not sure what's up with that.
