 URL : "https://github.com/rigor789/nativescript-vue/issues/77" TITLE : suggest : v-show BODY : as i know, v-if is not working properly. so i made this custom v-show with simple directive. only problem it has is sub components' conditions are evaluated. vue.directive 'show', { inserted: function el, attr { el.setattribute visibility , attr.value ? visible : collapsed ; }, update: function el, attr { el.setattribute visibility , attr.value ? visible : collapsed ; } } ;
