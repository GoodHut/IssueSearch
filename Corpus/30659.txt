 URL : "https://github.com/SoftwareMansion/jsc-android-buildscripts/issues/12" TITLE : public maven repos? BODY : thanks to everyone for working on this. it alleviates a huge pain in the rn community right now. is there any reason not to just run regular builds and publish them to public maven repos rather than have to build the deps at npm install time? if there's no reason not to, maybe we can run a job in a public ci tool like travis that builds and pushes a new versioned package every week or somesuch?
