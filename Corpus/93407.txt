 URL : "https://github.com/cursive-ide/cursive/issues/1847" TITLE : add support for macrovich? BODY : macrovich https://github.com/cgrand/macrovich lib allows defining macros for clj/cljs/self-hosted cljs platforms all in the same .cljc file. unfortunately, in its wrapper macros deftime and usetime cursive cannot recognise variable definitions, e.g.: clj ns being-john ? :clj :require net.cgrand.macrovich :as macros :cljs :require-macros net.cgrand.macrovich :as macros net.cgrand.being :refer add macros/deftime defmacro add a b + ~a ~b being-john/add will not be recognized by cursive as a variable i.e. it will be highlighted as unresolved symbol in other namespaces . i guess one of the general solutions can be allowing resolving specific macros as do in resolution intention since cursive has no problem with parsing defmacro s inside of do blocks: clj do defmacro add a b + ~a ~b ; add can be resolved here
