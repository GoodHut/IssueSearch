 URL : "https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/8462" TITLE : sensors status ideas BODY : piecing together sensor issues from logs is often more difficult than it needs to be. i was thinking of expanding sensors status to include the device id decoded , rotation, internal/external, mapping between uorb numbering and cal parameters, etc. then sensors status could be appended to the log preflight and postflight just as as perf and top are now. alternatively we publishing a few of the key details that are missing and do more work on flight review to decode and summarize. a snapshot of the sensors status table can also be helpful for debugging sensor rotation issues. @davids5 @priseborough @bkueng
