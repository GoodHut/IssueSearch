BODY : i am getting a warning in console that i dont get from other plugins using mysql. from what i have read, it may be fixable by adding &usessl=false without the quotes to the end of line 25 of mysql.java after ?autoreconnect=true like this: ?autoreconnect=true&usessl=false 17.03 19:39:59 server warn fri mar 17 19:39:59 edt 2017 warn: establishing ssl connection without server's identity verification is not recommended. according to mysql 5.5.45+, 5.6.26+ and 5.7.6+ requirements ssl connection must be established by default if explicit option isn't set. for compliance with existing applications not using ssl the verifyservercertificate property is set to 'false'. you need either to explicitly disable ssl by setting usessl=false, or set usessl=true and provide truststore for server certificate verification. thanks
