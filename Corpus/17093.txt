 URL : "https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/83" TITLE : new guides wanted BODY : we revamped the docs, but there are a few guides that are missing and that i think are essential. - community section with good resources e.g. https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/7117 - @mrscobbler glossary similar to virtual dom terminology that is now gone, but more friendly. check http://redux.js.org/docs/glossary.html for inspiration. - troubleshooting there are ~5 common issues we should explain right away, like wrong element casing, not loaded dom container, missing react in scope, etc. see http://redux.js.org/docs/troubleshooting.html for inspiration - accessibility - @madhug manipulating children using cloneelement and children https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/6942 - portals useful for modals - animation with react motion - @jamesknelson routing no need to use react router here, just show how to use setstate with html5 history api and point to rr as a component-based api for it once v4 is out - ajax just show how to use fetch in lifecycles, mention cancellation issues - reactperf should include a basic usage example, not just reference https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/6174 - snapshot testing https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/7431 - publishing a component https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/7882 if somebody wants to work on this please comment here and let's figure out a plan. help wanted!
