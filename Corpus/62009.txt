 URL : "https://github.com/Discordius/Lesswrong2/issues/142" TITLE : can't edit display name BODY : i notice that some users have a name that is different than their username. for example, https://www.lesserwrong.com/users/benito appears as ben in his user profile and as the author of posts rather than as benito. and 32 mentions a display name. i assume that is the same thing, but there doesn't appear to be a way to edit. it doesn't appear on the account edit page.
