 URL : "https://github.com/containous/traefik/issues/1832" TITLE : feature: web-01 support BODY : i'm trying to deploy traefik behind a reverse proxy that doesn't support tls-sni-01, instead i want to use a challenge that works over http. in the code it appears traefik currently only supports explicitly dns-01 and tls-sni-01. is this correct? for my setup to work, i need either web-01 or http-01. sadly i couldn't find anything related in the issue tracker. what did you do? configure traefik to acquire certificates with acme. what did you expect to see? valid certificate from let's encrypt what did you see instead? traefik default cert output of traefik version : version: v1.3.2 codename: raclette go version: go1.8.3 built: 2017-06-29_04:52:35pm os/arch: linux/amd64
