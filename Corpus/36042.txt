 URL : "https://github.com/DirectoryLister/DirectoryLister/issues/164" TITLE : force download files BODY : index.php line 99: <a href= <?php echo $fileinfo 'url_path' ; ?> class= clearfix data-name= <?php echo $name; ?> > adding <?php if strpos $name, '.' !== false && $name !== .. { echo download ;} ?> to the end makes sure unrecognized filetypes, like .flac, are downloaded instead of opened. probably not the best way to force this, but it's a bit annoying when a browser tries to open 2.3gb of flac into memory.
