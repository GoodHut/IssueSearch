BODY : it seems that there is something wrong with the lava cooling. i watched lava while flowing over a river water source. but instead of clearing the water source the lava builds some kind of igloo around the water source. is that the desired behavior? ! screenshot_20170124_183731 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16163058/22259222/c2e02562-e264-11e6-8cd8-180d6354865b.png
