 URL : "https://github.com/subgraph/subgraph-os-issues/issues/310" TITLE : consistent network issues BODY : i really want to use subgraph on a regular basis, but it seems like i run into the same issue every time. a few reboots after installing it, i lose internet functionality. i did a fresh install this morning and now it's night time and i already have network troubles. the logs seem fine from what i can tell, but nothing works. i can't even ping anything, because i get destination port unreachable , even 127.0.0.1 with the firewall disabled. the most i've done is change my hostname i've tried changing it back but it didn't make a difference , installed tor browser, and installed a few network-manager packages for openvpn that never worked. any help would be greatly appreciated.
