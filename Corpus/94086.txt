 URL : "https://github.com/sighmon/mjml-rails/issues/19" TITLE : blank emails on production BODY : hi, can't find any solutions so far for this, hope you could have some ideas about it. our mjml powered emails work perfectly when we use deliver_later, come out empty when we use deliver_now. if we try the same methods from console, everything works. everything works fine in developments, but i could find any references about env in the gem, am i wrong? thanks
