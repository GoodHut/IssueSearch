 URL : "https://github.com/joefitzgerald/go-plus/issues/718" TITLE : fuzzy import search BODY : prerequisites x have you tried launching atom . from the terminal in your project's directory? x have you verified the output from go env is correct? if it is, please include the output in this issue. x have you updated atom to the latest version? x have you tried using atom beta https://atom.io/beta , which can be run side-by-side with atom stable? is the behavior the same, or different? x have you updated your atom packages to the latest versions? x have you read the faq https://github.com/joefitzgerald/go-plus/wiki/faq ? x have you searched the issues https://github.com/joefitzgerald/go-plus/issues?utf8=%e2%9c%93&q=is%3aissue to see if others are experiencing the same issue? description fuzzy search for imports, primarily because it's difficult to remember usernames. expected behavior typing uuid for example would show all uuid packages locally. it would be potentially even cooler to list godoc.org's as well. actual behavior nothing nothing critical but could be pretty handy if anyone is interested haha.
