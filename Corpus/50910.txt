 URL : "https://github.com/Hireology/erlen/issues/15" TITLE : add enum functionality BODY : summary of issue a common use-case for erlen will involve an erlen attribute that is a list of items, those items of which should all come from a set of acceptable item options. currently, we can achieve this functionality with a validation: accepted payment method definition. most likely not defined in a schema file class constant accepted_payment_methods = credit card , debit card end schema definition class accountschema attribute :payment_method, string, { |pm| constant::accepted_payment_methods.include? pm } end in the above code, we'd like to guarantee that the payment_method attribute has an acceptable payment_method value either 'credit card' or 'debit card' since a standardize value is important to the consumers of the schema. although the validation syntax works well, the issue of applying constraints on schema values, such as is the case with enum is something worth considering. suggested steps: 1. determine if enum support is worth introducing into erlen and whether it can be implemented gracefully 2. implement enum into erlen
