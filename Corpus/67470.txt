 URL : "https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/issues/1007" TITLE : possible race condition BODY : hello - just talked to @jbaxleyiii on slack and he asked me to open this issue. i've ssr'd my app and i need to refetch a header component once it loads in the client, since that is when i have the jwt. the problem i'm running into is that if i call refetch on componentdidmount, the user data doesn't make it into props. this is easily fixed by setting a 1ms timeout, which makes it work. in both cases - with and without the settimeout - the network panel shows the correct data coming back, so this isn't an issue with the token being grabbed before it's available. here is the code: js import { component } from 'react' import { graphql, compose } from 'react-apollo' import { current_user_query } from '../queries'; class header extends component { componentdidmount { // this fetches the new data, but doesn't populate the user via props // this.props.currentuserquery.refetch ; // this fetches the new data, and populates the user via props settimeout this.props.currentuserquery.refetch, 1 ; } render { console.log this.props.currentuserquery.user ; const user = this.props.currentuserquery.user || {}; const { email = '' } = user; return <div> <p>{email} i'm the header!</p> </div> } } const userenhancer = graphql current_user_query, { name: 'currentuserquery' } ; export default compose userenhancer header version - react-apollo@1.4.14
