 URL : "https://github.com/Solution10/auth/issues/2" TITLE : missing method: haspackage BODY : the method haspackage as used in the last example of the managing the packages on a user https://github.com/solution10/auth/wiki/permissions managing-the-packages-on-a-user section does not exist in the auth class. i'd love to open a pull request with a fix, but i'd need to know if this is a mistake in the docs or simply a missing method.
