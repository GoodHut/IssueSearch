 URL : "https://github.com/fabtools/fabtools/issues/345" TITLE : redis v3.2.x require BODY : redis v.3.2.x has changed the name of the redis-check-dump https://github.com/fabtools/fabtools/blob/master/fabtools/require/redis.py l24 binary to redis-check-rdb https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/145473acc5798a499a0f37e42df48a014a3955c1 , which causes installation_from_source to fail during its final steps of copying redis binaries to a separate folder.. possible solutions would be to keep different multiple versions for the binaries config variable, or explicitly handle the v3.2.x case since it's probably exceptional.
