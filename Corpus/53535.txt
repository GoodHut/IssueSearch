BODY : hey there guys, a few days ago i asked @kytrinyx twitter if creating bundles docker images with everything you need to start coding would be a good idea? if i manage or someone else to create those docker images, i.e.: bash docker run --rm -it -v $ pwd :/code -w /code exercism/rust bash and you can run your test or something else and not worrying about installation and stuff. perhaps it's not a big deal but well i'm scientist, i gotta doubt everything. if this is not a great idea, please just close/remove this post. many thanks for all your hard work!
