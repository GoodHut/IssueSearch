 URL : "https://github.com/scala/collection-strawman/issues/152" TITLE : add throw annotations BODY : add @throws annotations to relevant methods, such as iterator.next and arraylike.apply int . i don't know if this is a priority right now, but for both of the methods above and there may be others , implementations should in most cases have a check which throws an appropriate exception, and @throws annotations might help to make that more obvious.
