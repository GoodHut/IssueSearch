 URL : "https://github.com/ArduCAM/Arduino/issues/143" TITLE : arducam mini 2p and spi BODY : hello, i'm trying to build an application on an stm32f207 using the arducam documentation. i have wired the camera and verified the timing of the spi signals using an oscilloscope. the camera does not output the proper values when reading from registers such as 0x00 or 0x40. miso is often asserted as 3-4 bits during the address phase and whatever it asserts in the address phase is what it outputs for the output phase as well. this behavior persists irregardless of which spi phase/polarity is asserted. i have read through the software and hardware datasheets, following their specifications, and have been unable to resolve this issue. spi spi pb_5, pb_4, pa_5 ; // mosi, miso, sclk digitalout cs pa_4 ; serial serial usbtx, usbrx ; int main { spi.frequency 100000 ; spi.format 8,0 ; int data = 0; while 1 { cs = 0; spi.write 0xff ; wait_us 50 ; spi.write 0x00 ; spi.write 0x00 ; cs = 1; wait_ms 5 ; } }
