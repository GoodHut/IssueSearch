 URL : "https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix/issues/1299" TITLE : add entry object BODY : just recently have updated laravel-mix and faced with one problem. on the previous version that i had before v0.12.1 , in webpack.mix.js i've been using entry through mix.config to add some custom assets, it looked like so: javascript for let file of glob.sync './resources/pages/ .njk', { ignore: ' /_ ' } { mix.config.entry .entry.add 'mix', path.resolve file ; } since v1.0.0, the entry https://github.com/jeffreyway/laravel-mix/blob/v0.12.1/src/mix.js l49 method was removed from mix class. what is the proper way to call and add entry object on the latest version?
