 URL : "https://github.com/PandaWood/Simple-MAPI.NET/issues/1" TITLE : info: html body BODY : nice project! for anyone like me who needed to send html body content to the email client, there is a quite simple way. example: mapi.attach filepath: c:\mymail.html ; mapi.send subject: a subject , notetext: null ; this seems to be a hack from older outlook express times. put your html content into an html file and attach it; set notetext to null; done. have not tested with outlook, but it works with em client.
