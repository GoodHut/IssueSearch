 URL : "https://github.com/MISP/MISP/issues/2638" TITLE : object level tagging BODY : dears, just a suggestion: it would be great to have the option to add a tag at object level and that the tag reflects on all attributes below. for now, i have to update every attribute with the appropriate tag for further back-office processing. if that feature would make it to an upcoming release, it would be really great! thanks a lot in advance! br's irving
