 URL : "https://github.com/jean-emmanuel/open-stage-control/issues/64" TITLE : question: svg support BODY : hey jean-emmanuel, in its current state does osc support creating controls based on svg shapes? if yes, when you have some free time which i know doesn't come easy can you provide us with an example? if no, would it be a huge change architecture-wise if you add support for svg that might be calling javascript functions and react to javascript callbacks coming back from osc?
