 URL : "https://github.com/LightsHope/server/issues/872" TITLE : nefarian druid call BODY : as a feral druid who goes cat on nefarian i have noticed multiple times that the druid call seems not to be working appropriately. if i am in cat form when druid call happens instead of staying in cat form the call takes me out of cat form, thereafter i am free to shift into whatever form i want or stay in caster form. i am not sure what happens if i were in bear on nefarian call, but if i am in caster form on call it seems to work as intended.
