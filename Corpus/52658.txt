 URL : "https://github.com/ethereum/viper/issues/591" TITLE : convert num sec to num BODY : i want to use the block.timestamp in an arithmetic expression for arrays index calculation. let's jump straight into the example: arr : num 2 @public def test : self.arr block.timestamp %2 = 1 i've got an error: cannot use positional values as modulus arguments! ok. let's try something different: arr : num 2 tmp : timestamp @public def test : self.tmp = 0 self.arr block.timestamp - self.tmp %2 = 1 now i see: typecasting from base type num sec to num unavailable actually, there is a way to do what i want: arr : num 2 tmp : timestamp @public def test : self.tmp = 0 some_var = block.timestamp - self.tmp %2 if some_var == 0: self.arr 0 = 1 else: self.arr 1 = 1 could you please clarify me the positional value restriction? and is there any way to solve my problem more humane way? viper version: 0.0.2
