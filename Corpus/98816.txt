 URL : "https://github.com/systemd/mkosi/issues/197" TITLE : libosinfo metadata support BODY : gnome boxes https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/apps/boxes uses libosinfo https://libosinfo.org/ to search metadata and automatically identify what operating system an iso image is for. this allows boxes to name a new box with a sensible name, like debian-9 . if a file is without metadata, the box will be named boxes-unknown . this is also the name visible in virsh, e.g.: $ virsh list --all | grep unknown - boxes-unknown-2 shut off i've just made a test on an image i've built with mkosi and here's what i get: $ osinfo-detect my-file.raw error parsing media: insufficient metadata on installation media
