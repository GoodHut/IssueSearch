 URL : "https://github.com/elementary/photos/issues/110" TITLE : add folder view BODY : couldn't shotwell just use the folder structure as events ? i usually have my pictures sorted in folder as events already, in this way i don't need any special program to easily access and find them. i find it the very best way, why should i want pictures sorted in one way in the photo viewer program and in another in my folders?
or at least add the possibility to use the folder structure in shotwell. it's really the only thing that makes me not use shotwell for my pictures. it's a great program, but i don't want to be stuck to it to organize my pictures. all the people i know access pictures through the file manager, it's just the simplest way, make a folder, call it whatever, and put the pictures there! if shotwell could use the folder structure it would simply be a plus for photo viewing, and i guess more people would use it. if you think about it, there are several ways to access pictures, either through programs or through the file manager. if the program you use needs special information that it stores somewhere and can't be read by anyone else, it's a very big impediment, especially in these days of cross-platforming. with folder structure you would be able to do just the same as now, and be accessible universally by everyone, just plain simple folders. launchpad details: lp1496908 https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1496908 ghoppa - 2015-09-17 15:37:28 +0000
