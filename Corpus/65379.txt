BODY : after getting a lot of great mileage out of react-mapbox-gl i just wanted to say thanks for your awesome work! i also wanted to share something i've been working on that might inspire a few changes here. basically i started with the component/context philosophy of this library, and tried to strip it down to be as close to the mapbox-gl-js api as possible. i also took the opportunity to abstract out some basic building blocks into components such as <mapevent> , <layerevent> , <hover> , etc. i was also able to clean up the map initialization bit by splitting it out into a couple components such as <mapgl> , <mapoptions> and <mapevents> which just delegates to a bunch of <mapevent> . anyhow, i totally recognize how difficult it is to manage refactors on a library as widely used as yours, and that's largely why i set out to experiment in my own space. hope it gives you some ideas. it's still going through some major changes but feel free to take a look. https://github.com/terraeclipse/react-stack/tree/master/modules/react-mapbox
