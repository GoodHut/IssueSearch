 URL : "https://github.com/Macrophage001/Dig-1.12.1/issues/1" TITLE : digging on speed BODY : mc 1.12.1 forge 2485 dig 1.1.7 alright this is hard to explain, but since the new update, it is like i am digging on speed/with haste. i did a small test to make sure it is not a mod interaction and even though i defined a durability of the grass block of 10, it took only 2-3 digs until it was broken. script: https://pastebin.com/yjb68rti but you can remove the botania entries and try it with only vanilla. thanks for making an issue tracker btw.
