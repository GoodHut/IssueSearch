 URL : "https://github.com/getsentry/zeus/issues/5" TITLE : first ui pass BODY : using this ticket to document some ui things. @ckj has already landed some skeleton, though i think we'll have to rethink the list of builds view as it likely needs to be full width. what we likely want is a build/repo view similar to changes, and then a drastically overhauled build details view. the core goal of the build list is to understand how quality is changing at a glance. the goal of the build details is to understand the result, and quick access to reports coverage, tests, screenshots . here are a few snaps from changes: list of builds <img width= 1431 alt= screenshot 2017-07-04 10 13 27 src= https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23610/27843188-eaf74168-60c5-11e7-91fe-1140d1ebb6e7.png > list of commits <img width= 1430 alt= screenshot 2017-07-04 10 14 09 src= https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23610/27843189-eaf84798-60c5-11e7-8433-ce0e5a48a2d8.png > build details <img width= 1424 alt= screenshot 2017-07-04 10 14 57 src= https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23610/27843190-eb0bb94a-60c5-11e7-941e-f5af980208d2.png >
