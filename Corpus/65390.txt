 URL : "https://github.com/fgeorges/mlproj-core/issues/31" TITLE : install from repository BODY : not sure how well this fits into the mlproj roadmap but i'll throw it out there anyway. let's say i'm in an mlproj project and i want to add a generic component which i've saved to github or similar. it would be nice to be able to run something along the lines of: mlproj get username/some-project this would pull the project, store the code under xproject/modules/ , and deploy automatically when running mlproj deploy . perhaps the package could be saved into the project.xml file as a known dependency. in keeping with the rest of mlproj capabilities, you could run mlproj install username/some-project -p 8080 and install some component e.g. a diagnostics tool into any existing project.
