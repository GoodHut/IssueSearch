 URL : "https://github.com/TF2PickupNET/TF2Pickup/issues/6" TITLE : add esea integration BODY : we can try checking if a user has an account on esea by just requesting the normal site and then looking in the returned dom. though last time we tried this, they were checking for real users and redirected which was a problem. we will need to investigate if this is still the case and if so maybe try creating a workaround.
