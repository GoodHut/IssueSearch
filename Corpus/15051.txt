 URL : "https://github.com/mebjas/CSRF-Protector-PHP/issues/87" TITLE : cookie path issue BODY : hi, i have come across an issue where, in a page that is mostly updated via ajax, the token expires on the 'main' page. this is because in my setup the ajax calls are made to scripts in a subfolder, e.g. /ajax/ajaxscript.php whereas the main page is served at the root, /app.php . i propose to work around this in my installation by setting the 'path' parameter on setcookie in the refreshtoken method of csrfprotector.php to be '/' rather than being blank. this will mean that csrfprotector now only issues one cookie per application, rather than multiple cookies for each subfolder in use. my question is, should this behaviour be the default? or is it undermining the security of the approach?
