 URL : "https://github.com/cznic/ql/issues/182" TITLE : where and aliased columns BODY : hello, i have a query that uses aliases for columns that would normally work on other sql databases: select id as id, name from artist where id < 100 order by id desc limit 15 but it doesn't work in ql: 2017/06/28 11:34:57 unknown field id: begin transaction; the problem seems to be on the where statement, order by works just fine: select id as id, name from artist order by id desc limit 15 is it possible to use column aliases in where statements without using this subquery syntax? select from select id as id, name from artist where id < 100 order by id desc limit 15
