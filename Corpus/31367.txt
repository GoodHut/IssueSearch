 URL : "https://github.com/BosNaufal/vue2-autocomplete/issues/36" TITLE : set url to variable BODY : my project needs to have a configurable url for the autocomplete api. is it possible for me to set the url equal to a string variable declared in the app? i've tried all the permutations of using/not using brackets and quotes that i can think of and they all either error out or take the variable name as the literal value of the api . any ideas would be appreciated. <autocomplete url= {{autocompleteurl}} @ url= http://localhost:61481/autocomplete/queryln @ :on-select= autocompleteselected anchor= name class-name= input-group-field > </autocomplete>
