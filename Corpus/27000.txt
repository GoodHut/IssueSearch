 URL : "https://github.com/mbeddr/mbeddr.build.docker/issues/3" TITLE : clean gradle caches BODY : currently the gradle caches aren't cleaned at all. we should have script or something that cleans the gradle artefact cache to not get into diskspace problems. i think supervised which we already use has support for periodically running scripts. we would simply need to do a rm -rf /root/.gradle/cache
