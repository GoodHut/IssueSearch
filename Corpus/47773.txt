 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTK/issues/74" TITLE : provide cmake support BODY : i hope you can provide the cmake support. reference here: https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/pull/538 > in the long them i think this library as well as directx ones should be switched to possibly pushed upstream cmake builds. it shouldn't be hard as all of them are rather simple. this could allow us to: > > easily support more than one vs version and uwp builds. > possibly enable dynamic build with cmake's autoexport as long as there are no data symbols in public interface > support static builds with either static or dynamic crt. currently dynamic one is always used and -windows-static triplets fail post-build checks complain about mismatch . > alternatively we could pass some flag to msbuild to fix crt linkage i didn't try this, but i think it's possible and maybe implement some logic to find correct project for example for vs2017 , but i find this solution inferior as it's possible there won't be project available for given configuration for example directxtk seems to be missing vs2017 uwp project . with cmake all configurations that make sense will just work. by switch build from msbuild to cmake, directxtk can easier to port to dynamic linkage,i created a test cmakelists.txt here: https://gist.github.com/sdcb/8ee863c79a70406d4ed8a9e3f10019a2 but it's still not done yet because the dllimport/dllexport is not specified.
