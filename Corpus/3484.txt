BODY : we should create a plugins api under init. this can allow for merging store middleware, setting up models, etc. js init { plugins: plugin , plugin2 } plugins may be: a an object b a string that internally references an existing local package c another possible api to consider, as used by dva: js const app = init // sets up plugin app.use plugin regardless, we should decide on a plugin api with some reasoning. some things to consider: 1 the plugins are more efficient if they run on startup, which leads me towards a & b. 2 if we are to hold all packages locally, i'd lean towards b. if users are able to create their own packages, or add config settings to a package i'd go with a. personally, i'm leaning towards a. what are your thoughts?
