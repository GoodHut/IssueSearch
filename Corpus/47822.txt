 URL : "https://github.com/thewca/tnoodle/issues/232" TITLE : put time stamp in pdf BODY : this was requested by @luis-j-ianez, via email about another subject > could we have not only the date but also the generation time, accurate to seconds, printed in the sheets? that would help detect possible abuses by replacing the legal scrambles with others. or does this sound crazy? @jfly answered in the same email discussion: > that's certainly possible, luis. however, it really only protects us from people who are not competent enough to spoof the pdfs which is a very easy thing to do . the only secure solution would be for the wca website to start generating scrambles, which might be a good direction for us to go, but would be a ton of engineering effort. i decided to open this issue to help in this discussion, see pros and cons.
