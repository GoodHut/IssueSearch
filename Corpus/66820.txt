 URL : "https://github.com/AndlyticsProject/andlytics/issues/745" TITLE : no published apps found BODY : i was checking my google account security settings: https://myaccount.google.com/permissions i noticed that andlytics had full access to your google account , which is more than any other app has except chrome . i thought hoped that perhaps andlytics may have needed this in the past, but has since made improvements to only request minimum permissions to access play store app data. so, i removed this access in the security settings. then i uninstalled andlytics from my phone and reinstalled it from the play store. i opened andlytics and selected my google account: the only one on my phone, and the same one i was using before. it's not a google apps for business account, and not linked to multiple developer consoles. it displays no apps, and says no published apps found . any clue how i can get this working again? i saw one other issue https://github.com/andlyticsproject/andlytics/issues/735 where somebody had to remove and re-add their google account on the phone, but i'm hoping i don't have to do that.
