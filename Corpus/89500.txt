 URL : "https://github.com/webmaxru/pwatter/issues/1" TITLE : question about datagroups BODY : i see in your ngsw-config.json that you have a datagroups section with what seems to be relative paths: /favorites and /timeline . however, these are api calls to https://pwa-workshop-api.herokuapp.com . can you explain how this works and why instead of referencing relative routes like the /favicon.ico , it matches a url like the font urls? thanks!
