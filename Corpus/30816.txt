 URL : "https://github.com/Kwoth/NadekoBot/issues/1000" TITLE : ready check request BODY : a feature requested by one of my clan members - a ready check system. simply put, someone uses a command to start a ready check and everyone else has to respond either in the affirmative or negative. i've attached a screenshot set up using .acr's to better demonstrate what i mean. if this could be limited to only the people in the voice channel of the person who started the check and with an optional variable for a timer, that would be awesome. not sure how doable this is, or how sought after it is, but it would be nice. : ! readycheck https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25179530/22269817/e09a1174-e284-11e6-8522-acea1dd1138e.jpg
