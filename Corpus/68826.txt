 URL : "https://github.com/BytemarkHosting/symbiosis/issues/46" TITLE : simple database creator BODY : a typical usage scenario for symbiosis is a user creating a new site, then uploading a php webapp and expecting it to work. the problem is, once they've uploaded the php content, they need to create a mysql database, which can only currently be done over the command-line or phpmyadmin. an interesting feature would allow a user to create a database file in the /srv/domain.tld/config directory, containing a user and password. symbiosis would detect the presence of this file, and if a database named after the domain didn't already exist, would create a new database, and grant the right permissions to it allowing local access with the username/password in the file. the user could then install say, wordpress with only sftp. > originally reported on bytemark's gitlab https://gitlab.bytemark.co.uk/open-source/symbiosis/issues/26 by @jiphex on 2016-08-10t11:39:18.395z
