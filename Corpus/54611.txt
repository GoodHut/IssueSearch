 URL : "https://github.com/rajdeepv/parallel_calabash/issues/30" TITLE : group by feature files BODY : hi @rajdeepv rajdeep, does this support running the tests group by feature files ? i am aware that this does not hold good if the feature file tests sizes are different. but in my case, i have relatively same number of scenarios in each feature file. i can't divide the scenarios in one feature file across more than one device and run in few functional modules of our app only .
