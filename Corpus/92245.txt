 URL : "https://github.com/WoWManiaUK/Redemption/issues/1929" TITLE : warrior 4 piece set bonus BODY : i know this issue has been posted many times but it is still not fixed even though your list of changes from your previous patch says otherwise. the issue is, that the 4-piece set bonus from t10 for fury warriors http://www.wow-mania.com/armory/?item=51225 gives you a 20% chance, that you will get 2 stack of bloodsurge http://www.wow-mania.com/armory/?spell=46913 , which makes your slam ability http://www.wow-mania.com/armory/?spell=47475 an instant instead of a cast. the problem is, that when you get 2 stack of bloodsurge , your slam ability consumes 2 stacks instead of 1.
