 URL : "https://github.com/citizenfx/fivem/issues/3" TITLE : failing to mute player BODY : this is more a question than an issue, sorry for the misuse, i thought you guys would be more reachable here. have you implemented the capability for a player to mute/unmute voice chat another one? if not, can a player lower the volume of another player voice chat again ? or isolating some player in some sort of channels? have a good day, best regards,
