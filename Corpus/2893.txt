 URL : "https://github.com/MeFisto94/openjdk/issues/4" TITLE : fix awt build BODY : so currently the awt build does not work. this leads to the lack of awt.dll and fontmanager.dll. it's possible to use the openjdk windows build's awt.dll, however for the fontmanager.dll i got an error no exports in the dll , so it's also preferable that our build just works. btw i used the unofficial build https://github.com/ojdkbuild/ojdkbuild because i did not want to sign up for a redhat developer account, plus they didn't have a zip distribution for now, we just disable awt, it doesn't make sense in real apps anyway and i don't know if it would work anyway, however it wouldn't harm at least for debugging and some other corner cases awt provides more than just it's windows, like image loaders, ... , to have it working.
