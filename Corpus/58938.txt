 URL : "https://github.com/grassator/pama/issues/3" TITLE : support regex matching BODY : it's pretty common to be able to match on regexps, so there should be some support of this in pama . one way would be to just support regexps inside is : js when 'fun', _ => is /fu.+/ ? 'f -like' : 'the rest' ; this means that you can't match on regexp as a value, which probably is fine. another way is already there by doing something like: js when 'fun', _, x => is x => /fu.+/.test x ? 'f -like' : /fu.+/.test x ? 'f -like' : // the same 'the rest' ; i think in this case the second version is better to not introduce another exception and implicit rule.
