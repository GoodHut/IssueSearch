 URL : "https://github.com/swdyh/goodbye_chatwork/issues/21" TITLE : behavior of -x option BODY : first, thank you to release the app let me download chatwork's log so much easily. now i'm archiving the current log with -x option and figured out that the app seems to download same files repeatedly. as far as i saw, it seems do loop over 40 times per one file. i'm not sure whether this behavior is correct or not and so want to question on this issue. thanks.
