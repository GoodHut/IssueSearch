 URL : "https://github.com/mh-cbon/go-bin-rpm/issues/13" TITLE : add source0 to rpm.json BODY : source0: the full url for the compressed archive containing the original pristine source code, as upstream released it. source is synonymous with source0 . if you give a full url and you should , its basename will be used when looking in the sources directory. if possible, embed %{name} and %{version}, so that changes to either will go to the right place. preserve timestamps when downloading source files. if there is more than one source, name them source1, source2 and so on. if you're adding whole new files in addition to the pristine sources, list them as sources after the pristine sources. a copy of each of these sources will be included in any srpm you create, unless you specifically direct otherwise. see source url for more information on special cases e.g. revision control . reference: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/how_to_create_an_rpm_package
