 URL : "https://github.com/servocoder/RichFilemanager/issues/133" TITLE : drag and drop BODY : the drag and drop feature appears to limit this feature to staying within the container, i.e. you can only drag and drop on one side of the splitter. is this by design, and is there a config option to allow the items to be appended to the body to allow the files to escape their folder. fyi: i'm not asking this to be able to drag and drop between views, but to do this to drop files on a div outside of the file manager. thank you!
