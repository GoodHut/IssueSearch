 URL : "https://github.com/jlund/streisand/issues/974" TITLE : cant get root access BODY : when i try to get root access after deploying streisand i get a permission denied publickey . error. i'm not sure how to ssh into root. i deployed my vps in vultr and used the localhost option since it was a brand new cloud server. when i was asked for the ssh key i simply left it blank and hit enter. streisand is working. i haven't tested everything yet, but i can't ssh into the server to make small tweaks.
