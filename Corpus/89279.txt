 URL : "https://github.com/lomereiter/sambamba/issues/280" TITLE : problem with cram parsing BODY : we first noticed this on version 0.6.4, but it appears to exist in 0.6.5 as well. running a command like: ./sambamba_v0.6.5 view -c -f bam file.cram -l 0 eventually results in an error like: glibc detected ./sambamba_v0.6.5: corrupted double-linked list: 0x00000000013f1430 if instead we output to sam, i get a slightly different error: sambamba-view: failure in cram_decode_slice samtools is able to parse these crams without issue so i don't believe that the issue is with the files themselves.
