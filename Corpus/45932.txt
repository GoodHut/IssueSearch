BODY : so i have two different sprites, one is an image of my dog and the others are obstacles. i can't get the obstacles to behind my dog and not in front. the code for my dog is before the code for the obstacles i'm pretty sure but it's still not right. also, when the dog hits an obstacle, all the obstacles are supposed to turn red but they're not for some reason. do i have a problem with the if statement? here is my code: http://alpha.editor.p5js.org/paigem/sketches/hjwbgoqaz
