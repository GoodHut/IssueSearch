 URL : "https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA-Resources/issues/301" TITLE : censorship for map names BODY : openra is a serious project, and map names like these: http://resource.openra.net/maps/14673/ or this one http://resource.openra.net/maps/14561/ or even this one http://resource.openra.net/maps/20459/ have a negative impact to the game. in the player base of openra there are people that don't like this kind of naming and will get offended, also female players might get alienated as well. adding a blocking filter of bad words in the openra resource center it will be advisable.
