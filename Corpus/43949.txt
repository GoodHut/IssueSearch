 URL : "https://github.com/h2o/picotls/issues/69" TITLE : documentation for hrr BODY : i am trying to find how to implement hrr in quic, and i am not sure how to do such things as: 1 tell picotls to not accept the client hello and generate a cookie instead. 2 tell the client to consume the cookie: is it sufficient to just send the tls message through the normal handshake api? 3 tell the server to verify the cookie. again, is it sufficient to pipe the messages through the handshake api? if picotls does not in fact support hrr, i suppose that the server application could generate the hrr and the cookie, and that the client could parse it and extract the cookie extension. then, client and server could use the handshake extension mechanism to send and verify the cookie. but that's quite a bit of work, and i would rather not have to do that...
