 URL : "https://github.com/dssg/triage/issues/105" TITLE : investigate hashing bug BODY : in a project we're seeing reports of diverging matrix hashes when the metadata seems like it should produce the same hash. try and reproduce this with an integration test: run a full pipeline, and then just model training and on with the same config. it should be able to use the matrices that are already there.
