 URL : "https://github.com/bluzi/name-db/issues/198" TITLE : add features to the api BODY : currently, all the api can do is to search an exact name/alias in the database and return its meaning and translations. we need more features, such as: - search /search/:term - should return a list of matches by a partial term search in both aliases/names - get translation /:name/:language - should return the translation of :name in :language anything else you can think of : you can easily run the api just by cloning the repo and run npm install && npm start , then you should be able to browse to http://localhost:3000 and see the api is running. your clone will connect to the actual production database, however the user supplied there is only able to select , and is limited by its number of queries per hour. if you need help or have any ideas, feel free to comment here.
