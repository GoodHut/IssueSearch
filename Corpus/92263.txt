 URL : "https://github.com/JuliaEditorSupport/julia-vscode/issues/427" TITLE : weave command not working BODY : when i try to use any weave command, the julia weave console pops up but remains empty. no files or previews are generated. this happens with both 8.1.0 and 9.0.0-beta . i have the weave package installed and most weave commands short of pandoc, as i don't use that work from a repl. did i miss any configuration or are you able to reproduce the issue?
