 URL : "https://github.com/TNRIS/flood/issues/160" TITLE : global sign out? BODY : we currently implement the use of 'global sign out' when clicking the sign out button within my gage alerts. this invalidates the tokens used which means that if a user is logged into the app from 2 browsers/sessions simultaneously and then signs out of one, the other one will still show they are logged in and all functionality will fail without notification. is this the correct behavior? should we not use global sign out in favor or a local sign out, or instead, continue to use global sign out but handle this with a notification that the user was signed out from another device?
