 URL : "https://github.com/archimatetool/archi/issues/242" TITLE : quantity characters limit BODY : hi all, all long element names in the diagram in the main arch window are displayed without cropping. however, when exporting from jasper to .pdf or .doc, part of the text is clipped - the entire table looks one-line. all that one line does not fit into the report is not included. to us, the conclusion in the reports is extremely important and the inferiority of the generated report makes further work impossible. can we hope that the limit on the number of characters displayed in jasper's reports at least the word, even in the pdf will be removed? ! 2017-05-30_10-32-31 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/29094130/26628782/a09189f0-4629-11e7-91e0-59067d3e9a61.png ! 2017-05-30_15-05-55 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/29094130/26628790/a738110c-4629-11e7-81aa-fd72cebf16dd.png
