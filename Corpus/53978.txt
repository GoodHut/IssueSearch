 URL : "https://github.com/sensu/sensu-omnibus/issues/214" TITLE : fastly api key changes BODY : from https://manage.fastly.com/account: migration to personal api tokens on may 15, 2017 to enhance security, we are replacing the account api key with personal api tokens. personal tokens support more detailed access control and allow the creation of multiple tokens per user. further: this account api key will be migrated to a personal api token on may 15, 2017. after this date it will no longer be visible. to store it for future use, copy the string to a secure location. for now, i'll collect this key while it's visible- possibly this won't involve many changes at all, but it popped up.
