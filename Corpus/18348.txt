 URL : "https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs/issues/2634" TITLE : survey tool popup BODY : there has been significant interest in knowing why and how the users use the data that a terriajs map makes available. one way of collecting this data could be to have a simple survey tool pop up and ask a user some very brief questions about a particular dataset they enabled. the tool would be very simple, have at most 1-3 questions, and take less than say 1 minute to complete. we would have to work out some heuristics probably customisable for when to pop up the survey tool such as: the user has a 10% chance of being selected at all the specific layer has been enabled for at least 3 minutes the user has been actively moving the view for 2 minute etc some example customisable questions that may be interesting for datasets, of which we may ask only one or two at the time to keep things fast and simple and more likely to get a response: you have been using layer x, how is that data useful in solving your problem today? is there another dataset that would be useful to combine with data x? what is the problem you are trying to solve with the data you are currently viewing? <log the datasets> what functionality should we add to make using this data easier? etc @kring @philipgrimmett @hilarycinis and others, comments?
