 URL : "https://github.com/mapd/mapd-core/issues/2" TITLE : improve literal hoisting BODY : currently, we generate memory loads from the literal buffer when the literal node is visited and rely on loop invariant code motion pass to hoist these loads outside of the query loop. this is a heavy-handed use of licm and might sometimes not be optimized. we should collect the constant expression with a visitor and generate the loads in the entry block.
