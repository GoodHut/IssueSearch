 URL : "https://github.com/anrodon/nem-microwallet/issues/6" TITLE : add different wallet types BODY : right now microwallet only supports simple wallets prng wallets but the nanowallet supports also brain wallets directly from your password/passphrase and private key wallets can only be created if you already have a private key for a previously created nem address . would be good to include this other kind of wallets to give full support to people already using them.
