 URL : "https://github.com/babyron64/vim_settings/issues/1" TITLE : .vimrc path error BODY : in .vimrc file, the path added to runtime path is started with ./.vim... , but it works badly, at least, on windows. on windows, when vim is executed outside of home directory, vim settings are not loaded probably because the . directory in the path is expanded at runtime and isn't replaced with home directory's path.
