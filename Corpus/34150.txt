 URL : "https://github.com/theCrag/website/issues/2787" TITLE : bulk edit of ascents BODY : adding proper bouldering types is means people what to change their historical ticks. it would be good to be able to apply a change across many ascents and/or a bulk edit interface. i think the bulk edit is probably not worthwhile, but applying a change across multiple ticks would save users a lot of time.
