BODY : some words can appear as more than one class i.e. noun, verb, adjective within a given line of text. i am not sure if someone has mentioned this already but it may be wise to create a new function to handle/categorize these kinds of words. an example can be seen in the pcm body.hs in the s4_intro paragraph with the line s instance +:+ phrase $ model ^. term +:+ s ode that models the solar water heating tank. . note that model is used as both a noun and a verb.
