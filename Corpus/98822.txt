 URL : "https://github.com/CCI-MOC/hil/issues/908" TITLE : libvirt obm driver for hil BODY : having a libvirt obm driver for hil can be of greatly benefit the efforts for projects like bmi. developers can set up hil in a dedicated physical server and have vms for nodes which can be used for bmi development. to elaborate, one of the time consuming part for doing development on bmi is troubleshooting the workflow of pxe booting a physical server. physical servers also take few minutes to boot, which adds to the lag during troubleshooting and development of new features. having such a driver, can have multiple use cases that can help speed up the development work. @zenhack @naved001 @apoorvemohan feedback.
