 URL : "https://github.com/cfpb/hmda-platform-auth/issues/101" TITLE : slim docker images BODY : it it likely worthwhile to remove what can be removed from the dockerfiles for keycloak and auth and externalize these build steps to either the local dev setup or jenkins depending on whether you are building locally or for deployment . alternatively and perhaps preferably , the installation/configuration of external dependencies ie maven, etc could be guarded by a build-arg so we can both create slim images or fully featured no-dependency images for a simpler dev setup. see hmda-platform-ui's dockerfile https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cfpb/hmda-platform-ui/372c16a237f2311fe9091571055db87807ce33e9/dockerfile for the build-args approach
