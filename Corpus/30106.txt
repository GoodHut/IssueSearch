 URL : "https://github.com/zJelly/nfancurve-amd/issues/1" TITLE : not an actual issue BODY : hey, just thought i'd pop over and say holy crap! this is so cool! :d i'm so happy you're doing this, and if you need any help understanding my current/future code feel free to contact me i always use nan0s7 on the socials . i'd also like to give you a heads up that i'm working on multi-gpu support in the next update, and i've also optimised the method the script uses to calculate the new fan-speed. still ironing out some weird issues with the multiple graphics card support but we're pretty close. but yeah, good luck with what you have planned for this. i look forward to seeing what you do
