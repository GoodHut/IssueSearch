 URL : "https://github.com/jbaysolutions/vue2-bootstrap-table/issues/3" TITLE : compile rendered html BODY : hi, not sure if i am able to formulate this issue correctly, as i am pretty new to vue. i loved how easy it was to render a column content following the instructions: i have my stats column, so i did { title: stats , renderfunction: renderstatscolumn } and the function let renderstatscolumn = function colname, entry { return <div class= btn-group role= group > <button type= button class= btn btn-sm btn-primary @click= showmodal = true ><span class= glyphicon glyphicon-stats aria-hidden= true ></span></button> </div> ; }; which worked perfectly and created the button in the proper column. however, the vue event handlers don't work. is the reason that the vue bootstrap table component is missing an option to compile the rendered content? in which case i would like to raise the issue or is it simply that i did something wrong and the component can already render html with vue event handlers? thanks in advance
