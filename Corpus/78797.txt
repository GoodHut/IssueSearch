 URL : "https://github.com/wg-perception/people/issues/51" TITLE : release 1.0.12 or higher BODY : 1.0.11 https://github.com/wg-perception/people/releases/tag/1.0.11 was made in 2016, but it didn't seem to have reached rosdistro as of today 1.0.10 for indigo http://repositories.ros.org/status_page/ros_indigo_default.html?q=people and 1.0.10-1 for kinetic http://repositories.ros.org/status_page/ros_kinetic_default.html?q=people . can we make a new rosdistro release soon? under currently available binary 1.0.10 some launch files are not runnable due to the fix https://github.com/wg-perception/people/pull/33 is missing. also i strongly suggest to use different version number schema between indigo and kinetic, since they are to be released from separate branches ref https://discourse.ros.org/t/maintainer-best-practices-handling-changes-through-ros-releases/771 , e.g. indigo and jade are same branch for now so keep 1.0.x , and for kinetic 1.1.x .
