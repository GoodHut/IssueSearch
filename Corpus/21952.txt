 URL : "https://github.com/NagRock/ts-mockito/issues/23" TITLE : how to mock fields BODY : is it currently possible to mock field values? unfortunately, not everything is using get and set functions and exposing the field instead. export class foo { isbar: boolean; } let foomock = mock foo ; when foomock.isbar .thenreturn false ; throws the error: > typeerror: cannot read property 'methodstubcollection' of undefined at methodstubsetter.thenreturn webpack:/~/ts-mockito/lib/methodstubsetter.js:18:1 at object.<anonymous> webpack:/footests.ts:25:33 is there a cool way without using: let inst = instance foomock ; inst.isbar = false; ?? if not, are you open for a pull request with an suggestion? if yes does it have to be similar to the java mockito way of doing it if there is one ?
