 URL : "https://github.com/googlesamples/unity-jar-resolver/issues/56" TITLE : gradle prebuild fails BODY : i get resolution failed. when trying to resolve jars after enabling prebuild with gradle . any ideas how i can resolve this? i'm way over 64k references, so i need to strip the unused and was hoping prebuilding with gradle could do that. heres the error from console error somewhere in the process of creating the gradle build, executing it, and copying the outputs. this will break dependency resolution and your build will not run. see the output below for possible gradle build errors. the most likely cases are: an invalid bundleid which you can correct in the android player settings , or a failure to determine the android sdk platform and build tools verison you can verify that you have a valid android sdk path in the unity preferences. if you're not able to diagnose the error, please report a bug at: https://github.com/googlesamples/unity-jar-resolver/issuesa possible work-around is to turn off the gradle prebuild from the jar resolver settings. error -1 : traceback most recent call last : file <string> , line 468, in <module> file <string> , line 459, in main file <string> , line 446, in process_args file json\__init__.py , line 338, in loads file json\decoder.py , line 366, in decode file json\decoder.py , line 382, in raw_decode valueerror: invalid \escape: line 24 column 12 char 863 generate_gradle_prebuild returned -1 unityengine.debug:logerror object googleplayservices.<rungengradlescript>c__anonstorey0:<>m__0 result googleplayservices.progressreporter:update commandlinedialog googleplayservices.commandlinedialog:update unityeditor.editorapplication:internal_callupdatefunctions
