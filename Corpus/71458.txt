 URL : "https://github.com/piwik/github-issues-mirror/issues/9" TITLE : add link to github issue BODY : often when googling for an issue i come across the issue mirror. but when i want to interact with the issue, it's quite inconvinient having to copy the issue id and looking for the original issue. it would be convenient if the issueid in the h1 would directly link to the original issue.
