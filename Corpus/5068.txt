 URL : "https://github.com/STIMALiU/BayesLearnCourse/issues/5" TITLE : lab 3 problems BODY : - many students are having problems in implementing the gibbs sampler for the probit model. maybe we should try to make them implement the different parts in steps? my guess is that it is mostly due to bugs in their code. - many students just look at the mean of the posterior when they assess convergance. how can this be made more clear?
