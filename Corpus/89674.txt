 URL : "https://github.com/ColinDuquesnoy/MellowPlayer/issues/176" TITLE : redesign service settings BODY : in order to correctly add network proxy support 170 , another service specific settings must be introduced. there are more and more settings and less and less room for them. i propose to change the service settings radically, we would switch to a grid of service tile with a settings button wheel . clicking the wheel would open a service settings dialog with tab/categories user scripts, network proxy, general . implementing this should also fix 175.
