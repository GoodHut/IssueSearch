 URL : "https://github.com/opentrials/opentrials/issues/763" TITLE : save airflow logs on s3 BODY : currently we store the logs inside the docker container, which uses an ephemeral filesystem. we could setup a docker volume to save the logs, but then we'd start having to take care of the host machine's backups currently it doesn't hold anything important . because of this, i think s3 is the best solution. tasks - setup connection and a place to put the logs on s3. it is sensitive information, so make sure to treat it as such i.e. it shouldn't be publicly accessible - alter the airflow.cfg with the new configuration it must come from env variables, so it'll be a bit more complex than simply changing the file
