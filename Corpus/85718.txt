 URL : "https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/issues/3148" TITLE : fix namespace declaration BODY : hello. symfony encourage us https://github.com/symfony/symfony-standard/blob/8065d0e2526bf973e316d82336a5543103274e43/composer.json l13 to put our tests in the tests folder. and the tests maps to a tests namespace. but actually you can do anything in this folder because theses classes are runned by phpunit. so you can omit the namespace, or you can use a not-related namespace. i would be cool to add a new fixed that would fix the namespace in a file a bit like the fixer that change the class name according to the file name and basically, here i'm talking about tests, but it could be the same for all folder / namespace.
