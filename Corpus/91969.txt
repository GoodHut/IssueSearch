 URL : "https://github.com/buildout/buildout/issues/421" TITLE : use importlib2 on python2 BODY : on a message in distutils-sig https://mail.python.org/pipermail/distutils-sig/2017-october/031752.html nick coghlan mentioned that python 2 scripts that use importlib2 https://pypi.python.org/pypi/importlib2 can alleviate significantly some of the performance symptoms of the long sys.path generated by buildout that happen in certain cases like network disks or other high latency filesystems. it might be a good idea to provide at least the option of adding the following call in the beginning of the preamble of scripts generated by buildout and zc.recipe.egg: import importlib2 importlib2.hook.install i wonder if we can achieve it in an extension.
