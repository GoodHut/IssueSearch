 URL : "https://github.com/kav2k/fl_favourites/issues/15" TITLE : delay first sync to cloud BODY : when a new instance of the extension is installed, it may happen that a race condition between default options being set in local and real options being received from sync result in clobbering of the storage by default values. it seems unlikely in extension-installed-by-extension-sync scenario, but may happen in development. and i don't like losing my settings! chrome storage sync mechanisms are a bit of a mess, but at least this can be partially mitigated by disallowing local->sync transfer within a short time after extension is launched. that way, sync has a chance to receive actual values and write them over the local storage.
