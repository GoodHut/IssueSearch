BODY : saving is broken? i'm playing new 3d golf simulation: waialae no kiseki https://www.segaretro.org/new_3d_golf_simulation:_waialae_no_kiseki on mega drive. if it's easier to test feel free to use the only western release in that golf series pebble beach golf links https://www.segaretro.org/pebble_beach_golf_links . after loading the game: - create data - register - change the name - end - press b to go out of that menu and then go back in - you should see the saved name you previously entered this is just one example, other things that should save in the game also do not. any ideas?
