 URL : "https://github.com/dadi/api/issues/371" TITLE : revisit default paths BODY : in config.js : js paths: { collections: { doc: 'the relative or absolute path to collection specification files', format: string, default: __dirname + '/workspace/collections' } } because __dirname refers to the path where the file is located, the default collection path will be node_modules/@dadi/api/workspace/collections when you're using api as an npm module, which is never what you want is it? . in practice, this means that unless users override this path in their configs, they won't be able to add collections. the same applies to custom endpoints and hooks. should we change this so that the default becomes {user_directory}/workspace and not {node_module_directory}/workspace ? /cc @jimlambie
