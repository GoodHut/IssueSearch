 URL : "https://github.com/caseyg/americanethnologist/issues/65" TITLE : image broken links issue BODY : for several interviews pages i created, the images i had embedded and verified to be working in the pages now have broken links. i've gone and changed them. what i had to do was copy and paste the image link again. they exhibited a very slight change in the link, which is think is attributed to that particular pages ranking. so when i re-order any pages, they lose their image links. if possible, can the image links that are generated not include the ranking number? here's an example: old, broken link http://americanethnologist.org/content/8-features/1-interviews/ 1-de-leon /jason-de-leon.png new, working link http://americanethnologist.org/content/8-features/1-interviews/ 3-de-leon /jason-de-leon.png i'm not 100% that these are due to the page rankings, but it is my first guess. what do you think?
