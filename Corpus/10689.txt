 URL : "https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura/issues/2618" TITLE : cura 3.0 updater BODY : cura 3.0 prompted me there is a new version. pressing download did nothing. after restarting cura 3.0 and rechecking for updates cura prompted: no new version was found . checked help for version number: still on 3.0.0. so - autoupdater does not work for me. what i did next was to download 3.0 again. i should note the latest version is named: 3.0 and not 3.0.3. when download starts the file reads 3.0.3.exe. i clicked on it to install it and a message poped up: ! ice_screenshot_20171018-120313 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30949968/31710325-4efc77de-b3fd-11e7-9e6d-ae65ee64ca3a.png since i have both 2.7 and 3.0 installed side by size i did not know which cura will get uninstalled so i skipped the install. please guys - we are in a transition between two versions of cura. you need to give us more accurate information what is going on under the hood. thank you.
