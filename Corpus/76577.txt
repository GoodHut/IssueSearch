 URL : "https://github.com/mozilla/thimble.mozilla.org/issues/1988" TITLE : line height is too small BODY : ! screen shot 2017-04-12 at 2 03 53 pm https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5816130/24972338/21bd8000-1f89-11e7-863b-e2dd09c4f3dd.png the bottom of the g in the url is cut off because the line height is set to the same value as the font-size we're using. i think we probably just need to either remove the line-height or set it to something bigger. if we want to maintain the same space in the blue box, we can reduce the padding. cc @flukeout
