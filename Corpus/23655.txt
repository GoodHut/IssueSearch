 URL : "https://github.com/json-schema-org/json-schema-spec/issues/349" TITLE : question about $id BODY : perhaps this has been covered elsewhere, but i couldn't find it. i found the definition for $id at http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-core.html rfc.section.9.2 a bit confusing; specifically this part: > to name subschemas in a json schema document, subschemas can use $id to give themselves a document-local identifier. this is done by setting $id to a uri reference consisting only of a fragment. the fragment identifier must begin with a letter a-za-z , followed by any number of letters, digits 0-9 , hyphens - , underscores _ , colons : , or periods . . > > the effect of defining an $id that neither matches the above requirements nor is a valid json pointer is not defined. the example that is provided is: json { $id : http://example.com/root.json , definitions : { a : { $id : foo }, b : { $id : other.json , definitions : { x : { $id : bar }, y : { $id : t/inner.json } } }, c : { $id : urn:uuid:ee564b8a-7a87-4125-8c96-e9f123d6766f } } } the specification says that $id is a uri reference consisting only of a fragment, which i assume is anything starting with a . it then goes on to say that the effect of defining an $id that doesn't match the above requirements, or is not a valid json pointer, is not defined. doesn't that mean that other.json and t/inner.json don't meet this criteria? neither of those are fragments. also, what does it mean when the fragment can be a json pointer? can you have an id like foo/bar/baz ?
