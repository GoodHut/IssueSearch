 URL : "https://github.com/qooxdoo/qooxdoo/issues/9471" TITLE : unify npm package names BODY : currently we have: qooxdoo-sdk qx-cli qxcompiler this doesn't feel very streamlined. long version: qooxdoo-sdk qooxdoo-cli qooxdoo-compiler or short version qx-sdk qx-cli qx-compiler or something else? publishing it as qooxdoo-sdk when it becomes qx-sdk will not make sense. except it's possible to remove these entries again.
