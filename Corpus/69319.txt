 URL : "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/issues/5245" TITLE : support thread grouping BODY : currently we do not group by the threads interface if there is a single thread. this was done intentionally because we do not want to group by threads normally however for a single thread case and no exception we do want to do it since clients can send thread data long on ios for log messages.
