 URL : "https://github.com/cszn/DnCNN/issues/7" TITLE : blind color denoiser model BODY : hi, i see that you include the pre-trained model for blind denoising on color images under model/specifics/gd_color_blind.mat i have noticed that this model does not include the parameters of the batch normalization layers. did you change the weights of the convolution layers after the training by scaling and shifting them with the batch norm parameters or did you just remove the batch norm layers from the model? i would like to use your model to initialize my network and either i need the full model or i need to have the same training dataset to be able to train it. may i ask you please for your help? thanks, caner
