 URL : "https://github.com/jelmervdl/kennissysteem/issues/12" TITLE : improve error reporting BODY : some errors, like some malformed xml documents, cause the linter to crash instead of giving a sensible error. these cases should be found and fixed. there are some places in the reader where assert instead of logerror is used. i'm not sure why, and maybe these need to be converted. there are also still some places in the reader that don't check for correct input. one common error is a space for a <! cdata ... > element. we can check for that or be smarter about such cases?
