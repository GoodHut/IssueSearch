 URL : "https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/issues/1629" TITLE : sort by title? BODY : i'd like to be able to sort by title rather than date as i have some feeds that are better suited to be read like that. i don't see any existing options to be able to do that as i suppose it goes against the nature of reading the most current news first. i've been experimenting slightly at implementing such a feature and the closest i've been able to do has been to change the function sqllistwhere in entrydoa.php from . 'order by e.id ' . $order to . 'order by e.title ' . $order or a variation like . 'order by e.id asc' this works well for one page of news articles but it does not scroll and load any more articles, it only says the feed is done, when it's not. basically this change loads one page at a time in title-sorted order. i'm not a good enough php coder to track down and fully understand all the points that exist to load the feeds so i'm stuck here, but i'd like to be able to continue and get this to be a working option, perhaps by adding a new navigation menu option sort by title / sort by date but i fear that it would take quite a bit of work. any ideas or help on how i can get this working? or could a more knowledgeable member or developer get this implemented? thanks in advance and i hope to see this as an official feature.
