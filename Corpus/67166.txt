 URL : "https://github.com/mushorg/tanner/issues/154" TITLE : padding oracle emulator BODY : padding oracles are famous in cookie-based attacks. the problem is that we need to send an encrypted cookie first to implement this type of attack. thus this emulator doesn't fall under the category of normal detect and emulate category, so what i'm thinking is that we'll send an encrypted cookie if user sends us some login data and we'll encrypt that data maybe username and some user id something like that to make it look real , we'll detect attack only on that cookie. once we found tampering invalid padding , we can send invalid padding type of responses. it's good to send the encrypted cookie only if some login type data is given, because sending a random encrypted cookie, won't make it look real. @afeena please review and provide suggestions.
