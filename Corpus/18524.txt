 URL : "https://github.com/Facepunch/garrysmod-issues/issues/3199" TITLE : think hook jitter BODY : for some reason, things like applyforcecenter are not consistent in the think hook. i've made a plot of d/dt-curtime vs systime and also a video showing this periodic jitter. pretty much all e2 creations are affected by this. if we could get it consistent then things would be much better. the spikes here seem to be periodic every 0.5 sec. ! jitterplot https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/cgvctvh6hk2soop/jitter.png?dl=0 the physics jitters seem to be every 1sec. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0oyg6k0jjs
