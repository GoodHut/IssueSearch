 URL : "https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl/issues/928" TITLE : % unsanitized for pgfplot BODY : % in strings is written to latex, where it acts as a comment. mwe: julia using plots pgfplots p = plot 1:5, 1:5, title = unsanitized % savefig p, /tmp/x.pdf i would be happy to contribute a pr, possibly for a general latex string escape function, but need a bit of guidance: 1. which function should call it, 2. does it belong in plots.jl or pgfplots.jl?
