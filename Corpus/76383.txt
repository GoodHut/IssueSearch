 URL : "https://github.com/luigirizzo/netmap/issues/282" TITLE : ixgbe statistics / linux BODY : hi, guys. i've noticed that when using ixgbe drivers optimized for netmap, that the statitics for packets & bytes sent, aren't processed anymore, they're 0 all the time, while netmap hooks the nic. is there any way that these counters could keep working ? when using netmap in freebsd this used to works without any issues, but after i moved to linux i've noticed this difference. if this is not possible then it's not a real problem, but since i missed it, i wanted to let you know. üëç
