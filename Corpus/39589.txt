 URL : "https://github.com/rubyide/vscode-ruby/issues/119" TITLE : slim ruby completion BODY : your environment - vscode-ruby version: 0.10.4 - ruby version: 2.3.3 - vs code version: 1.9.1 - operating system: macos 10.12.3 - hardware optional : make sure you have ruby , ruby-debug-ide and ruby-debug-basex19 installed before submitting your issue -- thank you ! not sure whether this is the right place, but i'm using https://github.com/sianglim/vscode-slim, which has correct syntax highlighting for ruby code in slim templates. perhaps this is based on a wrong assumption, but i'm wondering why code-completion doesn't work there even though i have vscode-ruby installed.
