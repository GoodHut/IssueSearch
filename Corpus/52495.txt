 URL : "https://github.com/simon-weber/gmusicapi/issues/591" TITLE : command line interface BODY : i saw a bunch of cli clients for gmusicapi, but some of them were outdated and the rest offered purely command-based interface. as i was looking for a lightweight easily navigatable tui for quite some time, i decided to make my own. here's the project: https://github.com/and3rson/clay it's using gmusicapi, urwid and python bindings for vlc. ! screenshot https://raw.githubusercontent.com/and3rson/clay/master/images/clay.png the main goal is simplicity of usage. i'm currently actively developing it and am looking for devs interested in contributing. thus i just wanted to say hi and check if anyone is interested in this. thanks! feel free to close this issue if it's not applicable here.
