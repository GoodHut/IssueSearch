BODY : browscap has the apusbrowser defined here: https://github.com/browscap/browscap/blob/master/resources/user-agents/browsers/apus-browser/apus-browser.json which appears to have been added because of some uas from 712. i've searched through our logs from this year for apusbrowser and this is the only ua that comes up: >mozilla/5.0 windows; u; windows nt 5.2; en chrome/37.0.2049.0 khtml, like gecko version/4.0 apusbrowser/1.1.720 safari/ which is similar to the uas in the test suite: https://github.com/browscap/browscap/blob/master/tests/fixtures/issues/issue-712.php l1012 https://github.com/browscap/browscap/blob/master/tests/fixtures/issues/issue-712.php l2231 this is the earliest snapshot of the apus website apusapps.com at archive.org: https://web.archive.org/web/20141025041329/http://www.apusapps.com/ apus which is from october of 2014. it seems that from the beginning they've always focused on android apps. their current site only provides an android download link for the browser: http://www.apusapps.com/en/browser/ unfortunately i don't have an android device handy to test what the android browser's ua is, but i'll try to get my hands on something and give it a test. that said, should these uas be trusted? was there ever a windows version of this browser?
