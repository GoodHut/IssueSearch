 URL : "https://github.com/ChrisAdderley/NearFutureSolar/issues/27" TITLE : niv-10 and niv-30 no ec BODY : thanks for the great work on the update. seems i've found a bug with the 2 non-deploying curved solar panels. they don't generate ec no matter how much sun shines on them! discovered this in my modded career, double checked on a vanilla install. all other panels working as expected.
