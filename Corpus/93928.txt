 URL : "https://github.com/badaix/snapcast/issues/254" TITLE : automatic buffer detection BODY : first of all this is a feature suggestion. i have been playing around with snapcast on my network, and have noticed that on various networks, the buffer settings need to be changed from anywhere between 200 to 1500 to be both reliable and snappy in terms of response time. given that the client knows when it has to stuff frames or drop them, would it not be possible for the various snapclient instances to feed back that data to snapserver, which in turn increases or decreases the server-side buffer to optimise response time and minimise dropout depending on the network conditions? would be interested to hear of the technical feasibility of this, as i'm not entirely sure how timing works in snapcast, i assume it uses wifi timing signals tsf ?
