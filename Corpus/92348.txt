 URL : "https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog/issues/149" TITLE : where to keep the changes BODY : i like to work with git flow. so i create features in different branches. then merge them to develop, and finally tag them to master. the question we have here, where do i keep my changes in my changelog. there are 2 alternatives: - write all the changelog items in the unreleased heading to the master branch. change the changelog before creating a new tag and move all unreleased items to their version. - write all the changelog in the unrelease heading to their features. merge them to the develop & resolve merge possible conflicts. change the changelog before creating a new tag and move all unreleased items to their version. this repo doesn't give me a guideline about this, and we're internally having a discussion about it. what is your view on this?
