 URL : "https://github.com/WorldFamousElectronics/PulseSensor_Amped_Arduino/issues/45" TITLE : inconsistent bpm readings BODY : i've changed the code to output only the bpm with the directions that were posted on a prior post and the readings are very inconsistent. it's clear that the sensor has not been working properly because even with the unaltered code, the light i have hooked up blinks very randomly. might i have a faulty sensor? ! screen shot 2017-03-01 at 5 17 12 pm https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25289401/23488802/c68e73ac-fea3-11e6-9141-9a11439aaa19.png
