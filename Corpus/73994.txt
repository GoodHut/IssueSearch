 URL : "https://github.com/sensu/uchiwa/issues/742" TITLE : docker hub build failing BODY : the uchiwa/uchiwa docker hub image https://hub.docker.com/r/uchiwa/uchiwa/ building seems to be failing at the moment. it's still referenced in the docs so i guess this still is the official image? expected behavior the image should build and be in line with the current stable uchiwa version. current behavior the image build is failing. possible solution i played around with the dockerfile from the github repo and found that it seems to be missing the nodejs-npm package. i'm not entirely sure if anything else is needed. context https://hub.docker.com/r/uchiwa/uchiwa/builds/
