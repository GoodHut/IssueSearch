 URL : "https://github.com/denschub/firefox-tabgroups/issues/79" TITLE : tabs without groups BODY : it seems it is possible to get tabs without groups, in which case they become completely inaccessible afaics . i've seen this on two occasions: - i closed a tab group, then used undo close tab to reopen them. - i restarted firefox, and opened new tabs before selecting a tab group at least that's what i think happened . would it make sense to have a special ungrouped selection which could be active automatically when ungrouped tabs are present ?
