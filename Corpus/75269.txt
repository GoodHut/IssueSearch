 URL : "https://github.com/andrewlin16/duckbot/issues/19" TITLE : graceful shutdown of bot BODY : right now the bot simply disappears and stop responding. all long-running commands are stopped without notifying chats/users. - message the general channel of each server opt-in/opt-out? - gracefully end all polls - when the bot goes down for maintenance, active polls should end and print results. - optional catch ctrl-c so this can be triggered from outside discord chat future prod pushes should involve shutting down the bot first, then doing the maintenance work, and finally restarting the bot.
