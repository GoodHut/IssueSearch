 URL : "https://github.com/ClxS/Stardew-Farmhand/issues/165" TITLE : linux platform build BODY : the only things that need to be done to make it work are disabling those three hooks, replace references to xna with monogame desktopgl and fix the separators and it works fine i guess. i'm not sure why the serializer was bugging out before. might have had something to with just the current configuration of the build which is why i started from scratch. seems like we'll be able to generate linux builds fairly easily too
