 URL : "https://github.com/scalda/FoolCraft/issues/185" TITLE : blocks are not breaking BODY : hey, just want to check, after the update yesterday, i have been experiencing some issues with foolcraft. blocks are not breaking, instead, when you break them, they reappear and only breaks after some time. i have restarted the client, my computer, increased allocation of memory to the game, but none of it has work. is the issue something to do with my cpu or the pack?
