 URL : "https://github.com/Zankoas/kaiserreich/issues/161" TITLE : cof incompletely annexed BODY : os: windows 10 version: 0.5.4 during wk2, the cof was successfully invaded by a combination of germany and nationalist france. i suppose this triggered a peace conference which i didn't participate in as i wasn't involved in the war , and nationalist france took back the country, but afterwards the cof was still left with savoie, haute-savoie, and corsica. - na do you have this issue in vanilla? - n were you in multiplayer? - y were you running other mods music mod doesn't count ?: player-led peace conferences steps to reproduce: 1. have the cof lose to germany and nationalist france the latter is probably more important . possible cause: i'm guessing the issue is because nationalist france doesn't have cores on savoie, haute-savoie, or corsica and obviously neither does germany , so neither of them was interested in taking any of those states. as a result, those were left untouched at the end of the peace conference. now that i think about it though, i'm not sure if you guys do that whole thing by event, in which case, that's probably the issue.
