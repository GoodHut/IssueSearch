 URL : "https://github.com/simonmar/monad-par/issues/47" TITLE : st monad trick BODY : hi, i was just re-reading your excellent book and came across this warning: there is nothing in the types to stop you from returning an ivar from runpar and passing it to another call of runpar. this is a very bad idea; donâ€™t do it. the implementation of the par monad assumes that ivars are created and used within the same runpar, and breaking this assumption could lead to a runtime error, deadlock, or worse. the library could prevent you from doing this using qualified types in the same way that the st monad prevents you from returning an stref from runst. this is planned for a future version. just curious, is this still meant to happen at some point?
