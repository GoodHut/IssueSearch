 URL : "https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/issues/10669" TITLE : unify export method types BODY : new issue checklist - x updated fastlane to the latest version - x i read the contribution guidelines https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/master/contributing.md - x i read docs.fastlane.tools https://docs.fastlane.tools - x i searched for existing github issues https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/issues issue description it's very annoying that match takes type as appstore , but export method in gym is app-store or other way around? in any case it would be great if you can just unify it so there is no difference. thanks! environment not required
