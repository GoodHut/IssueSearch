 URL : "https://github.com/LabVIEW-DCAF/MotionModule/issues/6" TITLE : prototype read method BODY : create a new mode specific to read all system information. the ds402 standard allows for reading specific mailboxes but dcaf only exposes the information within the channels to other modules. therefore it would make sense to have a specific mode that requests a large amount of information from the module, and possibly add a way to override specific pieces of data ex: pid values .
