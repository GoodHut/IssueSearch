 URL : "https://github.com/reedessick/eventSupervisor/issues/2" TITLE : implement a web interface BODY : we likely will want some sort of dashboard system that can be updated when a check is performed. in this way, we'd have a table or something with queueitems and tasks associated with different graceid's. each entry could be in a scheduled, action required, no action required, or failed state. this could provide a more intuitive interface than just a list of emails, particularly if you come back to a full inbox. what's more, it could naturally accommodate a ticketing system or some such thing in which users could acknowledge problems through the web browser. this could be a simple as clicking to mark something as unimportant with appropriate annotations taking place automatically under the hood.
