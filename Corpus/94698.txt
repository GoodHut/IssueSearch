 URL : "https://github.com/WPTRT/theme-sniffer/issues/77" TITLE : checks running in parallel BODY : at the moment when a check is running on a theme you can start a second check in parallel by selecting another theme from the dropdown and clicking go. this causes issues like gettings results for two themes and the progress bar goes over 100%. i see two solutions here. - remove the go button when running checks and add it back once the checks has reached 100%. - stop the current theme checks when another theme check is started. @dingo-d would love your insight as you wrote most of the js code.
