 URL : "https://github.com/pilwon/node-yahoo-finance/issues/35" TITLE : j2 not logging BODY : i'm trying to grab a stock symbol, the outstanding shares, and the last trade price only, but it's not logging the outstanding shares. here's my code: var yahoofinance = require 'yahoo-finance' ; yahoofinance.snapshot { symbol: args, fields: 's', 'l1', 'j2' , }, function err, snapshot { console.log json.stringify snapshot, null, 2 ; } ; and here's the output: { symbol : yhoo , lasttradepriceonly : 45.55 } even though i have j2 in there, it's just not being put down. it's not excluded in the index.js, so what's wrong?
