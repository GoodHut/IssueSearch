 URL : "https://github.com/tobi-wan-kenobi/bumblebee-status/issues/172" TITLE : arch bumblebee package BODY : not sure if anyone can help on that, but on arch, the bumblebee-status package is on aur as bumblebee-status-git https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bumblebee-status-git/ . the annoying thing is that it always asks to update, because it has to check the repo or something. can anyone make a normal package for it? so it updates like the others? not sure how to do that and if the author of the repo should do it to be official .
