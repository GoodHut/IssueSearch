 URL : "https://github.com/pupil-labs/pupil/issues/926" TITLE : hide pupil uis improvement BODY : i always liked that i am able to hide the settings menu. in version 1.x this is not available. for some usecases it would be nice to hide the status panel and control buttons on the left side as well.
please make it possible to hide all menus - so just the gazedot is visible in the world cam.
