 URL : "https://github.com/Cocolabs-SAS/cocorico/issues/30" TITLE : more detailed install BODY : hi, i'm having great issues trying to get this installed and working on a new linode linux server based on debian 8. i would ideally like to use centos 7 as i'm more familiar with that, however i believe it's not possible. would anyone mind writing a step-by-step guide for me to enable me to get this online and working as i have tried to follow the guide printed, but i've not been successful. thanks
