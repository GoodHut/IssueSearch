 URL : "https://github.com/opengisch/QField/issues/186" TITLE : sample qgis project BODY : to get quick idea what the app/qfield general can do it would be nice to have a generic sample qgis project in working form, with a basemap layer and some data and one basic survey form. current get started is quite difficult, i have used qgis for years but never created forms for example and there is no detailed doc or video how to do that properly.
