 URL : "https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/orientation/issues/237" TITLE : admin user setup BODY : we noticed today in lm01 that students needed to adjust their user accounts to be admin users. after doing that, they were in the sudoers file and could do the installfest tasks. might be worth mentioning near the top to make sure we are working with an admin level user. another instance of needing sudo was when we chown ed a directory. we needed to append sudo to get our admin user to own /usr/local : chown -r $ whoami :admin /usr/local should be: sudo chown -r $ whoami :admin /usr/local
