 URL : "https://github.com/arunKumarNOP/Saavn-Downloader-Android/issues/10" TITLE : problem with artist tag BODY : the app, i believe, embeds the first person from the top artists. in official saavn app, in any album if you go and see details of a song you'll see top artists and other details of the song where top artists can contain singers, music director and actors. this is a screenshot of the first song 'jiya tu' from album : https://www.saavn.com/s/song/hindi/gangs-of-wasseypur/jiya-tu/ryrfqqqcrei ! photo_2017-06-26_05-36-10 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11594075/27520832-9441a8bc-5a31-11e7-9c23-3dad70d734d1.jpg now, the app embeds the name of the musician in artist tag instead of singer's name while downloading the song. i have seen the same thing occurring when the singer's name wasn't first in the list of top artists.
