 URL : "https://github.com/Falklian/jammming/issues/3" TITLE : avoid writing to state BODY : https://github.com/falklian/jammming/blob/master/src/components/app/app.js l34-l35 when you write something like javascript let somearray = this.state.someproperty; somearray.push ; you are directly mutating react's state. this is a bad practice, as react's state should only be changed by this.setstate . consider using a non-mutating array method instead, like slice , concat , map , or filter which return a brand new array instead. you are then free to mutate _that_ copied array and then pass the final version to this.setstate . javascript let updatedplaylisttracks = this.state.playlisttracks.concat track ; this.setstate { playlisttracks: updatedplaylisttracks } ;
