 URL : "https://github.com/nmayorov/ufcnn/issues/5" TITLE : about resolution levels BODY : dilation = 1 for w, b in zip h_weights, h_biases : x = tf.nn.relu conv x, w, b, filter_length, dilation h_outputs.append x dilation = 2 doesn't this code make the first g conv layer g4 rather than g3? since h3 already has dilation of 2 3-1 , the last line would make g3 has dilation of 2 4-1 . although this doesn't affect the performance very much, since it's just one more resolution level.
