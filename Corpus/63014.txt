 URL : "https://github.com/GiovineItalia/Gadfly.jl/issues/1065" TITLE : dataframes v0.11 is out BODY : this is a pretty big change and we need make sure gadfly works with it. i believe the main hangup right now is that rdatasets which we use for tests doesn't work with v0.11 until https://github.com/johnmyleswhite/rdatasets.jl/pull/48 merges. then we'll need to drop dataarrays from require and peg the minimum version of dataframes at v0.11 and fix any problems.
