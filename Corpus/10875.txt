 URL : "https://github.com/winder/Universal-G-Code-Sender/issues/843" TITLE : dro always in mm BODY : i'm new to usg, so i don't know if this is a bug, or a feature. but i am using usg nightly and i have noticed that the dro never changes between mm and inches regardless of what mode the grbl controller is in. am i missing an option somewhere or is this a bug? also, on the dro, what is the difference between the numbers in the larger font vs. the number in the smaller font underneath each axis read out? thanks, jim
