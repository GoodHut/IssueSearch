 URL : "https://github.com/fuse-box/fuse-box/issues/685" TITLE : __fsbx_css not defined BODY : first of all, i love fuse-box, it has slashed my compile time from 20mins with systemjs+jspm+gulp to just under 5s. however when i use a specific angular2 package angular2-select that dynamically imports stylesheets, i get into trouble. it keeps giving me an error uncaught referenceerror: __fsbx_css is not defined , and i have traced it back to a piece of code in my bundle that exactly resembles this code: - https://github.com/fuse-box/fuse-box/blob/b60d13d6b664253f73276f251ac39bdf42e6f996/modules/fuse-box-css/index.js the above code is at the time of writing in master , but i added the hash to keep it working afterwards what seems to happen is that the __fsbx_css function is not defined in any of my bundle but is instead assigned to the module.exports variable. which means it wont be able to call it using the other alias. in the following file it does seemingly add the alias which appears to be an typescript source file : https://github.com/fuse-box/fuse-box/blob/93b5daca3fb1f91989983cf088b546a6f3672083/src/modules/fsbx-default-css-plugin/index.ts can anybody either tell me what i am doing wrong, fix, or help me fix the problem?
