 URL : "https://github.com/kubernetes-client/java/issues/30" TITLE : websocket post vs get BODY : created this issue to continue the discussion in 19 todo mehdy : add a summary of discussion here. i've digged a little more and found the issue that resulted in adding post: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/10366 i've also looked at the code and get and post serving paths look the same as far as i can tell . the argument in kubernetes/kubernetes/issues 10366 could be applied to spdy or http/2 but not websocket. one other solution for java client is to support spdy instead of websocket. this way we are not bounded by websocket limitation of get. but anyway i think we should be fine with websocket get only as the serving path is the same and there is no plan to remove get from exec/attach/portforward serving stack in kubernetes.
