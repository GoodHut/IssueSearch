 URL : "https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets/issues/492" TITLE : cannot connect to prosody BODY : what operating system are you running? linux what platform/language are you using? node.js are you using ssl, if so, how? ssl is not part of the equation what version of uws are you using? release v0.13.0 what features of Âµws are involved in the issue? client support websocket how does the issue reproduce? all the time can you show me some short code that triggers your issue or any other important information? i'm considering making the switch from ws to uws on https://github.com/node-xmpp/node-xmpp . i'm having an issue connecting though; prosody is an xmpp server with support for xmpp over websocket http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7395 javascript 'use strict' const ws = require 'uws' // const ws = require 'ws' const sock = new ws 'wss://ws.jabberfr.org', 'xmpp' sock.on 'error', err => { console.log 'error', err } sock.on 'open', => { console.log 'open' } results in { message: 'uws client connection error', stack: 'uws client connection error' } while it connects with ws . same with bare prosody without ssl on localhost .
