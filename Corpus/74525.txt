 URL : "https://github.com/muaz-khan/RTCMultiConnection/issues/379" TITLE : event listener for files BODY : i would like to know is there any listener for files sharing? like :file_folder: onmessage for chat messages. don't know it's available or not but can suggest enhancement like onfilerecieved etc. buffered reader will broadcast this event on completely receiving the file. thanks
