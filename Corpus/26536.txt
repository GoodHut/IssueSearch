 URL : "https://github.com/Macaulay2/M2/issues/637" TITLE : bfunction edge case BODY : from: yairon cid ruiz <ycid@ub.edu> here i send you a very short session in macaulay2 that crashes in my laptop: loadpackage dmodules r = qq x,y w = makeweylalgebra r i = ideal x^2, y^2 m = w^1/i bfunction m, {1,1}, {0} i think that the bug might be on the following line of the file â€œbfunction.module.m2 n := image matrix tolist i : {0_r} | {{1}} | tolist n-i-1 :{0_r} ; where maybe one has to put {{1_r}}. best regards, yairon.
