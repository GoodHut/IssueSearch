 URL : "https://github.com/erayaydin/jekyll-bulma/issues/4" TITLE : update jekyll & bulma BODY : i was in the process of creating a very similar project, when i discovered you had created a jekyll theme for bulma. i intend to use the bulma rails https://github.com/joshuajansen/bulma-rails however, if you would like i can update for bulma 0.5.1 and jekyll 3.5.2 before i do. would you be interested in a pr if i do? i know the navbar has probably changed along with a few other minor changes. eventually, i'm going to use the bulma-rails https://github.com/joshuajansen/bulma-rails gem to manage bulma, but i can wait to do that until after updating the core files in my fork. thanks for the work getting this going!
