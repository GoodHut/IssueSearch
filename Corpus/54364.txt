 URL : "https://github.com/imageio/imageio/issues/276" TITLE : freeimage and pgmagick BODY : hi, i'm trying to get moviepy working at minimal kilobyte cost. i discover that freeimage somewhat includes imagemagick, and that freeimage is no more kept up-to-date. would it be possible to shift to another wrapper of imagemagick: - preferably common with moviepy ? - wrapped in a cgohlke wheel ? pgmagick comes to mind, but there is also pythonmagick i'm not expert in the domain, maybe there are better alternatives, just hope to have only one wheel that can be shared by both projects.
