 URL : "https://github.com/zbanks/radiance/issues/37" TITLE : atomically alter graph BODY : using addvideonode , removevideonode , addedge , removeedge are cool and all, but they cause somewhat glitchy behavior and patterns can be dropped from the rendering if it happens between when a node is disconnected and when it is reconnected. these should probably be replaced with a changegraph removenodes, addnodes, removeedges, addedges method that atomically alters the graph.
