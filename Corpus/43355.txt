 URL : "https://github.com/clementine-player/Clementine/issues/5613" TITLE : crash in shuffle mode BODY : every time i try to play something in shuffle mode, i get a crash. it happens randomly and seems to be a bug in shuffle algorithm. what's strange is that clementine lasted much longer under gdb: i was able to play about 10 tracks before it segfaulted, while when run usual way, it crashes after the second or third track. expected behavior: playback without crashes way to reproduce: — load a playlist; — enable shuffling all tracks; — leave it for a while. os: debian stretch 64 bit, updated at least once a day; clementine: 1.3.1 backtrace i cut out everything before actual segfault happened : http://pastebin.com/knuky2lp
