 URL : "https://github.com/scryfall/feedback/issues/433" TITLE : what an amazing website! BODY : hello! i hope you do not mind me using the feedback form to provide some positive feedback! i had not previously heard about this site. i've used magiccards.info for many years; it's a great site, but it does have some limitations, and in recent years it's fallen behind on keeping everything up to date. it's clear from the syntax this site uses that you were inspired by it. and wow, how you've built on it! taking everything that made magiccards.info great and making it more powerful, more thorough, more correct in all the nitpicky details. you put in regular expressions! i used to have to use gatherer for that! the sheer thoroughness of promo cards, commemoration cards... i sometimes had to go to magic librarities to look those up! i noticed what you did with the is:reprint feature. how e.g. jarad lich not:reprint turns up the rtr version rather than the duel decks version, despite the latter being chronologically first. great improvement. that's clearly how it should work. anyway, yes, i just wanted to express my appreciation for this website, having just learned about it. i expect i'll be using this form a bunch more soon for its intended purpose -- i believe i've already found a few mistakes. : and i have a few feature requests too, already, if you don't mind... hopefully you don't find them too outlandish... my thanks to you once again! best regards, harry altman or sniffnoy on mtgs :
