 URL : "https://github.com/dogtools/dog/issues/115" TITLE : add go runner BODY : go runner will follow the same behaviour as previously implemented runners. it will use go run , without an explicit compile step. go run requires the file extension to end in .go . as future runners may also require specific suffixes, i think it makes sense to add them by default on all runners. the writetempfile function needs to be changed so it adds a suffix depending on the runner: - .sh for sh and bash - .py for python - .rb for ruby - .pl for perl - .js for nodejs - .go for go
