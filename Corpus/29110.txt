BODY : hey there, thanks for this package, it's great : i'm just wondering, why do you need to flip the array https://github.com/unicodeveloper/laravel-password/blob/master/src/dumbpasswordserviceprovider.php l33 of dumb passwords? no scientific measures here, but this operation seems to be kind of memory intensive and take a bit of time to run. it is causing some of my tests in a project to fail due to running out of memory. if i remove it, everything still seems to work as expected, and run a bit faster and use less memory. let me know. i'd be happy to submit a pr to remove it. thanks! ðŸ˜„
