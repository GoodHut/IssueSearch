 URL : "https://github.com/adamosoftware/Postulate.Orm/issues/23" TITLE : make querytrace saveable BODY : the querytrace https://github.com/adamosoftware/postulate.orm/blob/master/postulatev1/models/querytrace.cs class is nice, but there's no simple way to persist it in a tracecallback handler. this is one of those put-your-money-where-your-mouth is things. so, i think it needs to be based on record<tkey>. it should also use schema merge to create its own table on the fly.
