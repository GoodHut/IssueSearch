BODY : hi @ankeetmaini, i'm using your component for a plugin i'm building and i can say that so far it's much better than most of the other react infinite scrollers i've tried so thank you! my only issue is that the application that my plugin will be displayed in never scrolls on document.body, it uses a scrollable container div for displaying content inside. because of this, if i don't use the height prop, next never triggers. if i do use height then everything works except that the user now has two sets of scroll bars, one on the applications scrollable container and one on the infinite scroll component. this is a bit of an ugly experience so i was wondering if there's any way of setting the target scrollable container to a particular element? that way next could be trigger when then user scrolls to the bottom of the application's scrollable container. hope that makes sense!
