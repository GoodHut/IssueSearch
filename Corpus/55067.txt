 URL : "https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxGo/issues/38" TITLE : impact of interface{}? BODY : i have limited experience with it, but i've often read that there is a cost associated with the use of the empty interface in the boxing and unboxing. if you use reactivex in the data access layer and basically all your data is filtered by it, or at least the filtered/indexed fields, is there a noticeable impact to be observed by it's use? i usually just use the explicit data types, but i recognize where interface{} is useful. i used it to generate json in my jsonbuilder package as it would have been basically impossible otherwise.
