 URL : "https://github.com/fsharp/fsharp/issues/768" TITLE : fsharp.core in gac BODY : i wanted to start a discussion here to see if there are good reasons for keeping fsharp.core in the gac on mono. as far as i understand it, fsharp.core used to be in the gac on windows, but now that's no longer the case. having this assembly in the gac makes it more difficult to consume the nuget version. we needed to remove it from the xamarin.android gac recently for exactly this reason - users were referencing the nuget version of fsharp.core but the resulting build was building against the gac version. miguel brought this issue up yesterday here https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=58549
