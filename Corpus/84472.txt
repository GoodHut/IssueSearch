 URL : "https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/3779" TITLE : data labels looks unclear BODY : make sure these boxes are checked before submitting your issue - thank you! - yes i have checked the superset logs for python stacktraces and included it here as text if any - yes i have reproduced the issue with at least the latest released version of superset - yes i have checked the issue tracker for the same issue and i haven't found one similar hi, the bar values in the stacked bar charts of time series bar chart overlaps with the legends . i know i can fix this by providing the y-axis bounds , but the issue is that the data for the dashboards are loaded and viewed on a daily basis where , if i provide the time bound to be 1 million and if the end user sees the previous day data which is 10k , then the stacked bar is hardly visible as the y-axis scale is fixed to 1 million . it would be helpfull if there is a default spacing between the legends and bar values superset version 20.4 expected results i need the bar values to be visible clearly and should not overlap with the legends . something like this , here the bar size is small so it is visible clearly . ! screenshot from 2017-10-13 22-54-41 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30238125/32417936-af5c7a88-c286-11e7-899d-3ce96510c76f.png actual results the values in the stacked bar overlaps with the legends . ! screenshot from 2017-11-05 23-51-32 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30238125/32417859-a11c0552-c285-11e7-96c6-159b0f968a47.png steps to reproduce create a stacked bar chart in the visualization time series - bar chart with bar values and legends options in the chart option being checked .
