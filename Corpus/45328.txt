 URL : "https://github.com/vmware/harbor/issues/1293" TITLE : how to set harbor.cfg BODY : here is my way of deploymentï¼š make a cluster registry service with three harbor. the harbors deploy in three vm. each vm have a private ip, such as 192.168.1.x. and using a load-balancing to distribute the harbor requests to a virtual machine, bind a public ip to the load-balancing. so a request the public ip will be proxy to the harbor in vm. here is my test-case 1. setting the host ip in harbor.cfg with public ip, can docker login and pull/push a image from harbor. but setting the replication strategy on project not work. i think it causes by the host ip. 2. setting the host ip with the private ip, the replication work well, but cannot docker login. i don't know how to setting the harbor.cfg in this deployment.
