 URL : "https://github.com/filestack/filestack-rails/issues/175" TITLE : expiry length ignored? BODY : hi, i'm on rails 4.2.1 , ruby 2.3.1 , and filestack-rails 2.5.1 . i'm setting up in application.rb as follows: config.filestack_rails.security = { 'expiry' => 4663446066, 'call' => %w pick read stat write writeurl store convert remove exif } as far as i can tell, this is exactly how to define your own expiry. according to this epoch converter https://www.epochconverter.com/ , 4663446066 corresponds to 100 years from the current date. despite this, the server is still using a one-hour expiry. this is evident in the fact that i can no longer delete files all i'm using security for at the moment after an hour, and also from a quick look at the policy it generates: 2.3.1 :001 > rails.application.config.filestack_rails.security.policy => eyjlehbpcnkioje1mdg2ndiynzysimnhbgwiolsicgljayisinjlywqilcjzdgf0iiwid3jpdguilcj3cml0zvvybcisinn0b3jliiwiy29udmvydcisinjlbw92zsisimv4awyixx0= plugging this policy into the helper form on filestack's developer portal, tells me that this policy code represents: { expiry :1508641608, call : pick , read , stat , write , writeurl , store , convert , remove , exif } which is the expiry length for 1 hour. am i doing something wrong?
