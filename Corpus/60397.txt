 URL : "https://github.com/jumpinjackie/mapguide-api-bindings/issues/22" TITLE : .net target netstandard BODY : once 19 is fixed, the first port of call is for this to target netstandard. as our swig wrapper uses a very low surface area of .net in terms of classes, we should be able to target the lowest netstandard1.0 . this means our wrapper will work on .net core and .net full framework.
