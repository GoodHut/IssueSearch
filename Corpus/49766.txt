 URL : "https://github.com/xqemu/nxdk/issues/14" TITLE : update kernel imports BODY : the kernel imports are not complete. this should be changed. unfortunately it's also not possible to easily generate a new libxboxkrnl.lib i believe i ran into some issues with the existing one a while back, but i don't remember the specifics currently regarding the headers / signatures and datatypes, @patrickvl said: > almost all kernel signatures have been added to the openxdk copy in cxbx-reloaded, here : https://github.com/cxbx-reloaded/cxbx-reloaded/tree/master/import/openxdk/include/xboxkrnl > > i don't have the time to contribute to either openxdk nor nxdk, but you people shouldn't let a resource like this go to waste! ; however, i looked into this after naively moving the code to nxdk: there is some incompatibility as to where certain types are declared but this is easily fixed . there is also an issue with the datatypes structs only being correctly put in memory for msvc. clang / gcc use a different packing, so explicit padding fields and explicit packing has to be used. even mingw does not pack some structures correctly i believe. some signatures and data types are very obviously copied from copyrighted code. there are legal means to figure out these signatures, so we should use them, instead of just copying them around. while i think it's perfectly fine to copy the function signatures, at least whitespaces and comments should be removed / changed. eitherway, we should update our signatures and datatypes. contributions welcome.
