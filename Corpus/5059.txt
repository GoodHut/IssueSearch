 URL : "https://github.com/tobischo/gokeepasslib/issues/20" TITLE : kdbx 4 support BODY : now that kdbx version 4 has been launched, it would be _awesome_ if this code supported the changes outlined at http://keepass.info/help/kb/kdbx_4.html i may take a look at this myself later. i have a future project in mind and i'd like to use go, but i think any new keepass-related projects going forward should strictly support v4.
