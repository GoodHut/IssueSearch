 URL : "https://github.com/probot/stale/issues/55" TITLE : npm version out of date BODY : i'm trying to use probot-stale as a plugin to a large bespoke bot but i just realised that the version on npm is 5 months old and using probot-visitor which is causing a bunch of errors. i'm assuming this is because that module has been renamed to probot-scheduler quite a while ago and had numerous updates to it. would it be possible to bump the package version of this module and publish it to npm again? that would make this usable as a plugin again.
