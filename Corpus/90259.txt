 URL : "https://github.com/cslclaman/adi-api/issues/18" TITLE : search images by tag list BODY : accept a tag list aditags in image search from 1 to 5 or more, this depends from server . must use the existing endpoint /image get . possible implementations: 1. database - new method in imagecontrol or an adaptation of getlist method. receives an aditag list and, for each tag, get the id and searches by them on image_tags table. cons: don't will work for source, rating and errors tags 2. model - method in image model to split the tag string on tag strings... redundant, but continuing uses the method to return if the image has the tag list specified. 3. endpoint - like above, but in endpoint instead of image model.
