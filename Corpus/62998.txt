 URL : "https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-dashboard/issues/628" TITLE : dashboard data is blank BODY : make sure these boxes are checked before submitting your issue -- thanks for reporting issues back to parse dashboard! - x you're running version >=1.0.21 of parse dashboard. - x you're running version >=2.2.24 of parse server. - x you've searched through existing issues https://github.com/parseplatform/parse-dashboard/issues?utf8=%e2%9c%93&q= . chances are that your issue has been reported or resolved before. environment setup the dashboard is running on a separate machine from the mongo database and from the parse server. all servers are running ubuntu server 14.04.5 on digital ocean. steps to reproduce run server then run dashboard. open browser on dashboard and select any class. logs/trace there are no visible error messages. not sure how to get further logs from dashboard - only how to show logs from parse server. basically the dashboard is empty and shows no data. the scheme does load, and sometimes on a fresh load i can get a single screen-full of data. but no count values populate on the dashboard, and if i change to another class i don't get any more data. i was running dashboard version x.19, just updated to x.22 in case that fixed my issue, but it's no different. i'm not sure how to get more diagnostic info from the dashboard that might tell me what the issue is. parse.com dashboard this was a migration project does still show my data, and the app itself does work like normal, so it seems like this issue is isolated to the dashboard.
