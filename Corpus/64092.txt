 URL : "https://github.com/OSU-CS361-W17/group1_project4/issues/9" TITLE : firing - request failed BODY : the model can't fire anymore. this is probably an issue with inheriting the battleship model class and not overriding the functions in the easy and hard classes, or not inheriting the existing functions properly. i'm going to resolve this sometime later today or tomorrow. i have a presentation at 6:30pm and may go out to celebrate being done. i also have 2 reports extended to 5pm tomorrow that need heavy editing. please leave this for me to fix so that i can contribute some code and merge a pull request with the repository. : unless you need to test the code between now and tomorrow morning. if you do, please leave a bug or something so i can go in and fix it. or assign me an issue so i can complete that part of the rubric. thanks, jake.
