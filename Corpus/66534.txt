 URL : "https://github.com/stb-tester/stb-tester/issues/465" TITLE : multiple lirc instances BODY : i've got two lirc servers in my house, one upstairs and one downstairs, they both have ir blasters to control tvs and dvd/blu ray players, is there a way to have one of them rebroadcast ir commands to the second so i can set my client to control both of them and their respective devices? client -> command -> server 1 -> ir blaster 1 & server 2 -> ir blaster 2 i thought this could be accomplished with --listen and --connect but i can't get it to work as i imagined.
