 URL : "https://github.com/absinthe-graphql/absinthe/issues/387" TITLE : multiple graphql backends BODY : hi, i have a micro-service architecture, because that's all we do now :sob:, and i was hoping to run a master/minion configuration of absinthe. what do i mean by that? master - api gateway that handles authentication and passes requests to one or more minions for a response minion - exposes a small graphql subset at the moment, i'm starting to write resolvers that go and speak to other absinthe servers, but i'm hoping absinthe will provide a more idiomatic way of providing this. nb: apollo are working on exactly this and referring to it as schema stiching : https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-tools/pull/382
