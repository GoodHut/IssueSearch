 URL : "https://github.com/MacDownApp/macdown/issues/738" TITLE : dropping 10.8 support BODY : i did some counting on os versions of recent updates yes, i collect device information when you update macdown . this is the result from the last 1000 downloads: major version | count -|- 10.12 | 375 10.11 | 514 10.10 | 75 10.9 | 36 10.8 | 0 so either nobody installs macdown on 10.8 machines, or remembering this is only statistics for updates , on installations people running 10.8 don’t update. so this might be a good reason to discontinue 10.8 support. this will probably happen in 0.7, but i don’t have a timeline for that release.
