BODY : hello, i got a problem on trying to get my players to spot one out of my 2 dmc servers. a friend of mine reported that he couldn't find my dmc hookmod server but was able to join the other dmc server - dmc team play. i don't know why this is occuring. i tried to add in server.cfg setmaster add xx.xx.xx.xx as well test it without metamod, but doesn't seem to work. i also checked if the steam_app_d.txt says 40 inside the /dmc folder and it is. i don't know if one of the metamod addons is blocking the masterserver or not. and before you ask, no i've not inputted -nomaster in cli startup nor used rehlds as i don't think that is necessary. is this a glitch in the dmc steam master server or do i need to do a fresh installation as well backup my 250 dmc maps and materials for this server?
