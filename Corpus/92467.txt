 URL : "https://github.com/visionappscz/standardcss/issues/4" TITLE : write urls without quotes BODY : in readme.md you have written that you write urls without quoters. i totally agree with this rule. but if you check .stylelintrc there is written rule function-url-quotes : always , . and this mean that you have to write quotes when defining urls. if you change it to function-url-quotes : never , , everything will be fixed again.
