 URL : "https://github.com/firasdib/Regex101/issues/869" TITLE : creating bulk tests BODY : ux is not very good for rapidly creating 10 or so tests for a regex. what would be great would be to have an interface where each line defines a new test. when typing a string for a test, hitting return would create a new line right away. the options does match, does not match ... would be available on the right side of the line. that way, in very few clicks, it would be possible to create a full set of tests.
