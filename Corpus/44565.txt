 URL : "https://github.com/phaistonian/Asana-Plus/issues/2" TITLE : favicon needs updated BODY : asana changed it favicon and logo a while ago to be 3 red dot in a triangle. is it possible to update the asana plus favicon to match? i think you're attempting to do something regarding notifications using the favicon. i that the same thing that asana is already doing now with a black dot which represents new items in the inbox ? ! screen shot 2017-04-20 at 8 09 48 am https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/32290/25237904/c14ff3e2-25a0-11e7-9d2e-c0435ac71749.png perhaps it would be best to just remove the favicon notification feature from asana plus and go back to the default favicon.
