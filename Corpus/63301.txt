 URL : "https://github.com/tezos/tezos/issues/84" TITLE : doc: timestamp addition BODY : in protocol/alpha/doc/language.md, adding floats to timestamps is mentioned: add increment / decrement a timestamp of the given number of seconds. :: timestamp : float : 's -> timestamp : 's since floats are mentioned nowhere else in the doc, i guess it should be int instead.
