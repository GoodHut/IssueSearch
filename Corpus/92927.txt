 URL : "https://github.com/bethlakshmi/GBE2/issues/1065" TITLE : act bid review got hideous BODY : ! screen shot 2017-06-27 at 4 28 42 pm https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4542707/27608493-c3546ac0-5b55-11e7-9c21-0805773e1eb1.png this is likely a weakness in the original design that's been exacerbated by the recent work in styling for responsive design w. bootstrap. the answer is... more bootstrap. my approach would just be to wrap the review form and the change-state form in two bootstrap grid columns, make them 50/50 on the screen in medium/large screens and 100% on phones & small tablets. i'd make the coordinator box show up below the reviewer box.
