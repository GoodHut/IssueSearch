 URL : "https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/issues/3964" TITLE : add names annotation BODY : we've been focusing on improving guidance for human consumption. the steps returned in the api response are currently designed to provide the most relevant instructions to a human . one of the driving usability features is to try to reduce the cognitive load by only supplying the minimum instructions necessary to unambiguously follow a route. however, there are some analysis use-cases that don't want this heuristic: exhibit 1 https://github.com/project-osrm/osrm-backend/issues/3932 . instead of adding complex behaviour to our guidance code to not-collapse redundant instructions, i propose we add support for annotations=names - this would add to the existing annotations response, giving names for every segment along the returned route. this would neatly and optionally solve the analysis use-case that we've seen pop up a few times, and require no changes to the guidance code. the name information _should_ be readily available for adding to annotations. i haven't really dug into this codepath yet, but i think it should be relatively straightforward.
