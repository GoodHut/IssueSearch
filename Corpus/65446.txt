 URL : "https://github.com/keenlabs/KeenClient-PHP/issues/97" TITLE : intermittent ssl errors BODY : i'm getting similar errors as described in issue 67 and am wondering if there's a reason why these could be happening they seem to be coming from keen, and not from our client and any recommended way to deal with them? my keen php client setup is pretty vanilla: $keen_client = keenioclient::factory 'projectid' => $project_id, 'writekey' => $write_key, 'readkey' => $read_key ; the only thing i can think of is that somehow either curl on our end or the keen.io endpoint is choking on the throughput of many requests being sent at the same time and that i should make use of guzzle's backoff plugin to retry failed logging attempts?
