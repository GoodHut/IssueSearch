 URL : "https://github.com/thibaultcha/TCBlobDownload/issues/75" TITLE : download filename issue BODY : hello! great project here first of all very useful! second of all, there is a bug that i found where if the file name is a / it messes up renaming the file since it doesn't consider it a file name, rather as a path, so when i rename, i get my documents directory nested in subfolders inside other subfolders with the renamed filename. i think there should be a protection against this. this happened since i allow my users to download any html page they are on, and if you are getting the file name from the last path component of the url it usually would see the last path component as a / . i suggest also an improvement, if you get the response of the url, i think you can access a property of response.suggestedfilename might be better
