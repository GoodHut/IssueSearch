 URL : "https://github.com/walkor/Workerman/issues/235" TITLE : binary protocol problem BODY : i can not solve the problem with the binary protocol in websocket, chrome produces a bug in game.ts: 61 websocket connection to 'ws: //127.0.0.1: 8000 /' failed: could not decode a text frame as utf-8., as i understand it this is due to the wrong frame that the server gives away, probably it gives out the text format, instead of the binary, in the documentation i did not find a way to configure under the binary protocol
