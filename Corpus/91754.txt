 URL : "https://github.com/geopython/pygeometa/issues/73" TITLE : update base_mcf bahaviour BODY : cc @alexandreleroux our current base_mcf support requires the base mcf to be a fully qualified mcf. update base_mcf support so that base mcf files are relative from where they are defined. this results in, by design, mcf snippets which are not required to be fully qualified mcf files. in addition, inheritence should continue to be supported i.e. if value in base mcf and not in child mcf, then set; if in child and in base, override .
