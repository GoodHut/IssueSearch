 URL : "https://github.com/JavaScriptRoom/culture/issues/41" TITLE : ndugger's ro status BODY : i'd like to start a vote to remove ndugger from the list of room owners for regular and repeated 'trolling' and working to escalate instead of de-escalate drama. while we all have our bad days i certainly do his regularity in being on 'the wrong side' of room drama is making other ro's job difficult at times. this would not exempt him from becoming an ro in the future.
