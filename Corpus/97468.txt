 URL : "https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/liquidhaskell/issues/941" TITLE : guards vs equational style BODY : it appears some aspect of liquidhaskell prefers guards over idiomatic equational style. consider: fac :: int -> int fac n = n fac n-1 fac n | n == 0 = 1 | otherwise = n fac n-1 {-@ reflect fac @-} nothing wrong there, but: fac :: int -> int fac 0 = 1 fac n = n fac n-1 results in: <no location info>: error: uh oh. snip /nat.hs:14:13: error: cannot promote haskell function fac to logic alttolg on default sorry if this is already a known limitation that i had missed.
