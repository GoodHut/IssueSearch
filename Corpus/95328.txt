 URL : "https://github.com/carbonblack/cbapi-python/issues/56" TITLE : credentials in constructor BODY : the python-api readme https://github.com/carbonblack/cbapi-python/blob/master/readme.md does not include any information about passing options/credentials into the constructor. i thus spent an hour or more trying to get disk credentials to work in a restricted environment. however, after looking at the code i realized it is in fact possible to pass the url and token as parameters in the cbenterpriseresponseapi constructor. please update the readme to reflect this
