 URL : "https://github.com/SpectoLabs/hoverfly/issues/544" TITLE : max size for cache BODY : currently, there is not limit for the size of the cache, so memory consumption could keep going up. if we introduce a limit, it would make this go away. making it configurable would also be useful: hoverctl config set max-cache 1024 or something?
