 URL : "https://github.com/stevemao/get-pkg-repo/issues/10" TITLE : augmented error message BODY : hi, i was just about to implement semantic-release-gitlab https://gitlab.com/hyper-expanse/semantic-release-gitlab when i always encountered the error message no repository . when i digged https://gitlab.com/hyper-expanse/semantic-release-gitlab/issues/17 a bit deeper i found out that the error message came from an underlying module. this module ; the error message is getting thrown in this https://github.com/stevemao/get-pkg-repo/blob/1fd9902142452dc6eed86db7173dd7b78f7d78d5/index.js l78 line. would it be possible to change the error message to something more meaningful like missing repository field in package.json or something like that?
