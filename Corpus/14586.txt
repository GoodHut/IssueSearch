 URL : "https://github.com/DSpace/dspace-angular/issues/145" TITLE : base path support BODY : as you build your app, using default settings, your project will work under: http://localhost:3000/ but if you need to use a different base url like http://localhost:3000/angular/ you can use the simplest solution wich is to set the html5 <base> tag in the index.html file: <base href= /angular/ > changes here can be a problem regarding the config settings in different environments. in a production environment you might not want to use the /angular base path. other solution is to use the app_base_href, <base ng_href= {{app_base_href}} > and in the app module, include: import { app_base_href } from '@angular/common'; @ngmodule { providers: { provide: global_config, usefactory: getconfig }, { provide: app_base_href, usevalue: '/angular/'} , i think this base path should be a supported enviornment setting serverconfig already includes the baseurl property .
