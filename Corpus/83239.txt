 URL : "https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/3638" TITLE : c/c++ code collapsing bug BODY : description of the issue in c/c++ code, collapsing has a bug and collapses wrongly by mixing with comments. steps to reproduce the issue make a .h file and copy paste below simple code. then just try to collapse the empty class: class myclass { //} }; expected behavior i expect that the class is collapsed from first { to last }. actual behavior but it collapses from first { to the } inside comment line!. if i put a space before the } in comment line meaning //} to // } it works properly.
