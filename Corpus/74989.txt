 URL : "https://github.com/cheezy/service_mock/issues/2" TITLE : forked repo - tests fail BODY : i forked the repo, used rvm to install ruby 2.2.1 ruby 2.2.1p85 2015-02-26 revision 49769 x86_64-darwin14 , ran bin/setup, then ran rake spec. some of the basic tests fail as follows: integration test starts the server failed - 1 stops the server stubs a message failed - 2 uses a file and stubs a message failed - 3 uses an erb file and has to form a message failed - 4 embeds a subtemplate into an erb using render failed - 5 can modify the embedded subtemplate failed - 6 does not send a stub when it is disabled uses the default value when value not present failed - 7 overrides the default value with the provided value failed - 8 rake task test starts the server process failed - 9 stops the server process failed - 10 servicemock::stubcreator should create stubs failed - 11 should not create stubs when it is disabled all of the following tests run successfully. bottom line appears to be that the server never starts... i guess i'm missing something here?
