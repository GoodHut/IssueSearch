 URL : "https://github.com/cassiocardoso/git-labels/issues/1" TITLE : ideas for labels BODY : perhaps a color group for: code review , continuous integration ci , code deployment cd , optimization bundle size/performance or building too? idk. additions should be: feature , enhancement , epic . i think question , discussion and tdb are confusing. what is the difference? maybe idea in the same color group of the winner from the battle above? invalid , duplicate and wontfix should be brown! ðŸ’© i think seo isn't a problem. maybe group it with bi ? ui and ux should be grouped together. chore , copy , legal and other similar tasks should be using a lighter gray.
