 URL : "https://github.com/thephpleague/plates/issues/145" TITLE : add folders with fallback BODY : this feature https://github.com/thephpleague/plates/issues/19 which allow to add folder as fallback don't work for me. or maybe is not designed as i think. 1 $this->template = new \league\plates\engine path/to/default/template ; 2 $this->template->addfolder 'custom', path/to/custom/template , true ; 3 now i can call $this->template->render 'my-view' ; and plates will check first in path/to/custom/template and then if not found my-view will check in path/to/default/template ? this is how i understand, but i have to add custom::my-view for make this work, otherwise don't work. is that correct? in this case i have always to use custom::my-view right? thanks
