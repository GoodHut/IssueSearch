 URL : "https://github.com/sakoehler7/eesim/issues/24" TITLE : cdc scraping run time BODY : i found a way to scrape data from the cdc using rvest and purrr. i also used a javascript bookmarklet by hadley called selectorgadget to figure out what css selector i needed to use in rvest. it's awesome, check it out. here i've scraped nyc values for current week legionellosis for weeks 1-9 of 2017 9 values in total . i'm a bit worried about the slow run time of the code i wrote and am wondering if that's to be expected. here it is, and you should be able to run it just with the code below: {r} library rvest library purrr i <- 1:9 url <- i %>% map ~paste https://wonder.cdc.gov/mmwr/mmwr_2017.asp?mmwr_year=2017&mmwr_week=0 , as.character .x , &mmwr_table=2j&request=submit&mmwr_location= , sep= html <- url %>% map ~read_html .x nodes <- html %>% map ~html_nodes .x, 'tr:nth-child 15 td:nth-child 2 ' nycdat <- nodes %>% map ~html_text .x as.numeric nycdat the read_html part seems to be the slow part. let me know what you think before i scrape all the data, because that might take a while.
