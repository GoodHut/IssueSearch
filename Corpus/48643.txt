 URL : "https://github.com/owncloud/diagnostics/issues/34" TITLE : share scenario report BODY : in many bug investigation cases ex: shared storage hell series we were missing the exact sharing scenario of a user to find out what is going wrong for example when mounting stuff. we should implement a diagnostic command to report a sharing scenario up to one level for a specific user. occ diagnostics:sharingreport user1 for example if we have user3 shares x with user2 and user2 shares y with user1 . when asking for a sharing report for user1, we get all received shares up to two levels: - user1 - receives x from user2 - user2 receives y from user3 additionally the command should report whether any of the mentioned users are zombies/disabled/... so the sharing query needs to be done outside the api, maybe directly on the db, to bypass the code that might exclude shares from the list due to disabled users. @tomneedham as discussed yesterday evening cc @cdamken @deepdiver1975 @butonic @mrow4a
