 URL : "https://github.com/erpas/serval/issues/13" TITLE : to improve the plugin BODY : i'm searching for a tool to modify raster values along a line/polyline with values at ends of lines/polyline taken from raster. second goal for me is a tool which can change the raster cells between two lines/polylines simmilar length. the lines can be approximately parallel. new values for raster cells should be assigned only for cells between these lines/polylines but not for raster cells along these two lines. the raster cells along these two lines are the base/boundary condition of interpolation. maybe it is possible to improve the plugin and expand it for similar purpose.
