 URL : "https://github.com/emailjs/emailjs-imap-client/issues/137" TITLE : browserify and tcpsocket BODY : i'm attempting to get emailjs to run using browserify. at first i was getting forge undefined but adding <script src='https://unpkg.com/node-forge@0.7.0/dist/forge.min.js'></script> fixed that issue. now when i run the sccript i get uncaught in promise error: runtime does not offer tcpsockets! at new tcpsocket renderer.js:26602 at function.tcpsocket.open renderer.js:27494 at promise renderer.js:521 at promise <anonymous> at imap.connect renderer.js:520 at promise renderer.js:7799 at promise <anonymous> at client.connect renderer.js:7795 at object.17.emailjs-imap-client renderer.js:28441 at s renderer.js:1 isn't the whole point of forge and emailjs-tcp-socket to provide support for tcpsockets? any help would be very appreciated.
