BODY : hi arctic fox users! first of all, i do not work for, endorse or even know the developers. i just wanted to say... donate them some monies! ££££ these guys have significantly improved our vape lives, and i am sure almost all of you will agree. we keep requesting features and finding problems but i bet 80% or more of us will never consider donating to them! i get paid on the 25th of this month and i will be giving a healthy donation to them. if you like arcticfox, give these guys a bit of credit for their time. go on their official website and chuck them some money using the link. by donating, we will be funding and encouraging these guys to continue to develop the firmware as well as add new devices etc. show the arctic fox team some love
