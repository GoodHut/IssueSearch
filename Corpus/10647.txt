 URL : "https://github.com/gavintapp/pdfsmaller/issues/2" TITLE : create log files BODY : in version 1.0, the script checks the output dir to see if the current file being optimised is already present. if it is, it immediately moves to the the next file. this step allows for the scrip to be stopped and restarted, or run in several concurrent instances across large collections of files without the same file being optimised over and over. an improvement on this would be to log the processing of each pdf in a txt file. this should log - file name - original size - new size - original mod datestamp - optimised datestamp the file should be stored in the dir where the script was run though it could go to /var/log . it should also include a start and end time + duration for the script. along with a summary of the number of files optimised and total change in file size.
