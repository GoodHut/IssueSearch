 URL : "https://github.com/r-spatial/mapedit/issues/21" TITLE : edit and select as modules BODY : in the first release, we chose to return the values from edit and select to the r console. however, for greater impact, providing a shiny module will allow users to easily add edit and select within a larger shiny app. i'd like to add functions for the modules and then change edit and select to use the modules. to prevent confusion, edit and select should probably still be used to return values to r.
