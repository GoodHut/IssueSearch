 URL : "https://github.com/vavr-io/vavr/issues/2014" TITLE : improve javadoc formatting BODY : currently the javadoc looks really ugly in cases we have many generics e.g. try.withresources . especially the lines are _very_ long. the following style makes the docs less hard to read by fitting the lines into the browser window and adding better line-break semantics: css pre { white-space: pre-line !important; } code, tt { white-space: pre-wrap !important; }
