 URL : "https://github.com/react-toolbox/react-toolbox/issues/1117" TITLE : redux theme switcher BODY : i have written connectedthemeprovider: class connectedthemeprovider extends component { render { return <themeprovider theme={themes this.props.theme } children={this.props.children} /> ; } } connectedthemeprovider.proptypes = { theme: proptypes.string.isrequired }; const mapstatetoprops = state => { theme: state.theme.currenttheme } ; export default connect mapstatetoprops connectedthemeprovider ; and it's all good. i have 3 themes: import theme1 from './theme1'; import theme2 from './theme2'; import theme3 from './theme3'; export const themes = { theme1, theme2, theme3 }; export const availablethemes = object.keys themes ; and it's all good every theme has only a key for the appbar rtappbar and a style for the background color like this: .appbar { background-color: yellow !important; } !important because the appbar loads his main color, but this is not a big problem my problem is: the theme for themeprovider switches correctly through redux store , but the style for appbar doesn't change, remains always the same. all the styles appears correctly in bundle.css this is my index: <provider store={store}> <connectedthemeprovider> <connectedintlprovider> <router history={history} routes={getroutes store } /> </connectedintlprovider> </connectedthemeprovider> </provider>, and getroutes contains the app: export default function getroutes { return <app> routes with their components </app> ; } could you help me please ? thank you !
