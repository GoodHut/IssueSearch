 URL : "https://github.com/L33T-KR3W/push-dir/issues/23" TITLE : push-dir on ci BODY : hi! first off, of course, thanks for this great project, i use it in quite a few of my static sites : just curious if it would be possible to use push-dir on travisci out of the box? if not, would it be possible to make that happen? or what configuration would i need to use push-dir from travis? i was going over this gist https://gist.github.com/domenic/ec8b0fc8ab45f39403dd and just got to wondering about this... thanks!
