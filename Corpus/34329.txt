 URL : "https://github.com/skycocker/chromebrew/issues/620" TITLE : cannot install scons BODY : in trying to install subversion, it pulled in scons as a dependency. scons cannot install because it tries to install to /usr/local, which is not writeable without sudo, which we are not supposed to use with crew. ruby def self.install system python2.7 setup.py install --prefix=/usr/local end i notice most other other packages install using prefix= {crew_dest_dir}, so is scon's install to /usr/local an oversight?
