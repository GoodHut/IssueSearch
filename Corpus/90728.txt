 URL : "https://github.com/exponent/ex-navigation/issues/386" TITLE : stacknavigation pop hangs BODY : i'm using a stacknavigation component to implement modals for workflows that need to complete or be canceled before returning back to where the user was. however, on android, when i use navigationactions.pop 'root' , the modal slides down and gets to about 5 pixels from the bottom of the screen and then hangs. i then can interact with parts of the app, but can't do any other navigation in the app.
