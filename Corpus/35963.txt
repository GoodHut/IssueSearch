 URL : "https://github.com/CoastalResilienceNetwork/GeositeFramework/issues/847" TITLE : fix scrolling issues BODY : in firefox and ie11, the vertical scrollbar does not work properly in the launchpad or the regional planning plugins. this can be seen in http://lr01.internal.azavea.com:81/hudson_tnc_ny_prototype_221/. the scrollbar does not appear at all in the regional planning plugin. it does not appear in the launchpad unless extra content is added to the launchpad-plugin div. this is true even when the height of the screen is small enough to seem to warrant a vertical scrollbar.
