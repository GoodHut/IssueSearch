BODY : hi! i was trying out certlint and i think the -bulk flag isn't setup quite right. i can't find in the code where the overall app is waiting for the concurrently spawned work is being executed. i have an example file with 5 certs https://github.com/adamdecaf/cert-manage/blob/master/testdata/lots.crt that i get different results with -cert and -bulk . -cert : $ ./certlint -cert ../../adamdecaf/cert-manage/testdata/lots.crt certificate type: ps failed to verify chain for entrust.net certification authority 2048 -bulk : $ ./certlint -bulk ../../adamdecaf/cert-manage/testdata/lots.crt checked 5 certificates $ cat report.csv issuer,cn,o,serial,notbefore,notafter,type,error,revoked,cert $ code: https://github.com/globalsign/certlint/blob/master/certlint.go l86
