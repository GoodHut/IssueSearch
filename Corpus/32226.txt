 URL : "https://github.com/elemenohq/elemeno-node/issues/11" TITLE : unbuilt npm package BODY : hi everybody, it's me again. i noticed that the npm package has an uncompiled es2015 version of the elemeno sdk in the lib folder. using an uncompiled version works fine in properly configured dev environment but breaks, for example in a webpack build process for production and throws an unexpected token class elemeno error. is there a reason why you didn't published the npm package with an in-any-environment-ready-to- use version of elemeno? this would be more convenient and usable for es5 projects too. any thoughts about that? cheers üê¶ vogelino
