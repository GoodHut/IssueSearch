 URL : "https://github.com/christophediericx/ArduinoDriver/issues/24" TITLE : analog pin references BODY : hi there again, thanks for the new features in the latest version. i noticed a few issues while testing it on my project: 1 i could not find enum values for analog pins in the library references. are they implemented? 2 also i'm not sure whether it's the project which i'm working on but i'm experiencing drops in performance whenever i switch between different method arguments on the driver e.g. switching between arduinodriver overload 1 and 2 and switching from leonardo to uno boards.. i'm suspecting serial port event handler but this problem is way over my head : thanks again for putting this out there for us non-engineers!
