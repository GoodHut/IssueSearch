 URL : "https://github.com/twinssbc/Ionic2-Calendar/issues/206" TITLE : scroll to first event? BODY : i saw there is a method that uses scrolltohour when the view is changed but i'm uncertain how i can get the current week or day that it is viewing in order to scroll to the first event in the calendar. in other words, if for example i have 3 events on a specific day, one starts at 1 am, the other at 3 am and the last one on 7 am i want my view to automatically scroll to 1 am so that the user doesn't have to scroll every time they enter the view. i simply need to always scroll to the earliest event in the week or day view. is there some sort of example on how to get the current date of a calendar's week or day view so i can check which events are set on that day or week?
