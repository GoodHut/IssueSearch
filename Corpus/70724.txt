 URL : "https://github.com/travitch/taffybar/issues/228" TITLE : wshud hangs, wss doesnt BODY : the ui sometimes becomes unresponsive when i use wshud instead of wss. it happens seemingly at random, and usually after a full day of uptime, but it happens regularly enough that im certain it only happens in wshud. its likely a deadlock in the ui or some other concurrency related problem preventing re-painting. clicking things still works, its just that labels and images never change all widgets, the wshud, the clock, cpu graphs, etc i would blame my taffybar, but if i change just one line to switch to wss, the problem goes away. i was using wss for months and then i switched to wshud a coupla weeks ago and it started dying regularly again . i havent re-? reported ths bug because i havent been on the latest wshud code, but i am now, and it happened twice in the last 3 days. im still trying to collect more data, but i wanted to put this out here now jic
