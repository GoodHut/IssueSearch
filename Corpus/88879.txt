 URL : "https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/issues/280" TITLE : pagerank crashes database BODY : when i call pagerank multiples times in the same cypher session, i will suddenly abend like this: ssl connection terminated while receiving data. this can happen due to network instabilities, or due to restarts of the database. bye! exception in thread thread-0 org.neo4j.driver.v1.exceptions.clientexception: cannot run more statements in the current session as an unrecoverable error has happened. please close the current session and re-run your statement in a new session. at org.neo4j.driver.internal.networksession.ensurenounrecoverableerror networksession.java:279 at org.neo4j.driver.internal.networksession.reset networksession.java:127 at org.neo4j.shell.state.boltstatehandler.reset boltstatehandler.java:172 at org.neo4j.shell.cyphershell.reset cyphershell.java:184 at org.neo4j.shell.cyphershell$1.run cyphershell.java:192 there is nothing obvious in the neo4j log nor the debug log... however the neo4j instance is usually completely dead. i'm guessing there was a memory leak and that the database ran out of heap, but i can't tell. the bigger graphs die sooner than the smaller graphs, however they all seem to die after a few subsequent runs within one session. presumably my solution is to open a new session for each run. i'll test that shortly. however, i wanted to raise this issue. i hate it when databases silently just die.
