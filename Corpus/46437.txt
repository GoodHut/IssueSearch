 URL : "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/issues/1469" TITLE : map loading indicator BODY : picking up from 979, the game gives no feedback when a map xml is loading. war of relics is a pathological xml, but it is a good example of this behavior since the map takes about 30s to load. the game appears frozen during this time. the ui should be providing feedback to the user to indicate it is loading the map xml. proposals - progress bar / window - status message label the status label update has a very low performance cost. this could be as simple as renaming a button after it is clicked and we are now loading a map. the progress bar/window i've found in previous performance analysis was quite expensive on its own. therefore we would not want to show it unless a map was likely going to take a long while and most maps do not, they are typically under 2 or 3 seconds . this then gets into some complexity.. meanwhile updating a status somewhere is pretty simple, and accomplishes the feedback goal.
