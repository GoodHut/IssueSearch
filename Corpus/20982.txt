 URL : "https://github.com/maddinat0r/samp-discord-connector/issues/3" TITLE : discord ws timeout BODY : discord seems to close the gateway after two minutes if no events are send. it also seems to close the gateway incorrectly; it closes the websocket connection directly, completely ignoring the ssl layer, which results in a stream_truncated error message. the plugin will need to reconnect to the ws gateway, just like it got a reconnect payload opcode 7; with resume payload .
