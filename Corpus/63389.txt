 URL : "https://github.com/CanonicalLtd/UCWifiConnect/issues/35" TITLE : don't insist in connect BODY : management portal shows a connect button that when pressed, shows an alert informing of consequences of trying to connect, with an ok to confirm. this implies pressing two different buttons to finally execute one single task. this should be prevented and let the user to connect by only one button press, maybe showing permanently the said alert, though ideally should be showing that alert only first time the portal is used
