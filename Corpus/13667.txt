 URL : "https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/186" TITLE : wiki timeout bot BODY : would be nice to have a bot that basically goes through pages and does the following: looks at any page that hasn't been edited in x days mark the page in some prominent way as possibly outdated also pings those who have edited the page in the past to say make sure i'm still up to date, if i am up to date, remove this message any save to the page obviously means it's been recently edited , so problem solved
