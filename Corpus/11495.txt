 URL : "https://github.com/adimichele/hubspot-ruby/issues/94" TITLE : how can we help? BODY : at huntress labs we use this gem to integrate with our hubspot instance. i see there are several issues filed and a number of pull requests waiting to be reviewed and merged. i would like to help out maintaining this project since it's important to us. would you mind adding me as a maintainer or would it be easier if we just fork the repository? cc: @dan987
