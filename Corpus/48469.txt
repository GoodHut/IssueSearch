 URL : "https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup/issues/1821" TITLE : scraper source update BODY : hi, i was looking at the code and noticed that it just does go get but if go already has code it won't update it. https://golang.org/cmd/go/ hdr-download_and_install_packages_and_dependencies go get -u would update things. i could also be misunderstanding how it is run. i don't have an internet connection to download the latest code and test how this is working or send a pr. https://github.com/retropie/retropie-setup/blob/master/scriptmodules/supplementary/scraper.sh l21 if i'm mistaken, feel free to just close this.
