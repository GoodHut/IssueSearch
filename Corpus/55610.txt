 URL : "https://github.com/mooz/js2-mode/issues/407" TITLE : jsx double-nesting bug BODY : while jsx parsing does work on nesting elements, it can't go js -> jsx -> js -> jsx indefinitely. specifically, this expression does not parse right: <div> { <div></div> } </div> ; ! parse https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3344958/24067040/06b5aa16-0b35-11e7-929c-2f1ab60d5713.png it appears the inside <div></div> is parsed as js, which messes up the parsing for the rest of the line. while the above example is a bit contrived, but it's not uncommon to write an expression like: <div> { foos.map foo => <foo id={foo.id}/> } </div>
