 URL : "https://github.com/symfony/flex/issues/72" TITLE : integers in json BODY : i had an issue in contrib 15 https://github.com/symfony/recipes-contrib/pull/15/commits/d07c8d480e277ec467d988e7168ecdfe54c5f399 in which the validator says my json is invalid because it contains integers, but integers are valid in json. validation says only json files must be valid https://github.com/symfony/recipes validation so either documentation or validation needs to be fixed.
