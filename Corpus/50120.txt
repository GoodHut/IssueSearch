 URL : "https://github.com/rogierschouten/ts-events/issues/13" TITLE : void -> promise<void> BODY : hey, i want to use this library but i need to have promises, that's mandatory requirement for me, i'm going to use attachsync and i need to do awaits here. i've already done development https://github.com/jokio/ts-events , i'll need to re-write some tests and pull request will be ready, if its okey from you. i was also thinking about having attachsync and attachasync, when there will be attachsync with promise, will still be necessary async version ? p.s. thanks for creating this library
