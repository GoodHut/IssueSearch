 URL : "https://github.com/NGGameSim/NGGameSim/issues/15" TITLE : decide on license for code BODY : since the project is open source, we need to decide on a license under which to put the code and assets that we use in the project. we will mostly likely need separate licenses for both with code parts, and the asset parts. we may also potentially need a different license for the dummy algorithms we write. one potential thing to worry about is that the license we apply to the dummy algorithms will probably also apply to any algorithms that are written for the competition. this includes any algorithms that ng writes and gives to us. because of this, we may need ng input on this ticket as well.
