 URL : "https://github.com/rtbo/rust-xcb/issues/36" TITLE : more documentation :- BODY : hey, i've noticed for some items in this library the documentation can be a bit lacking. ie: internatom, internatomreply etc. the functions inside of those implicits should at least be documented for example, i thought i had to use xcb_intern_atom_reply before i found that it is included in this library by checking the generate source code . if you point me in the direction of adding this documentation in the xml file from which the rust code is generated, i would be happy to add it as i go through using the library. i would just need to know what format is needed in order to properly generate.
