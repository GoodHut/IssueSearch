 URL : "https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues/30" TITLE : api definition filtering BODY : i'd like to introduce the concept of api definition filtering to the hsda design discussion. in an effort to help ensure the api design speak to as wide as possible audience as we can, i'd like to build on discussion around data filtering, and schema filtering, and allow for labeling and packaging up of the api paths using the openapi tagging. in the openapi, each path can have one or many tags associated with it. we can create a simple set /organizations/, /locations/, /services/, /search , and a more complete set with all the direct paths to sub elements--reducing cognitive load for new users, while also allowing for access to precise paths for directly updating phone number, or an address without being bothered with entire schema. i'll work on an example to show how api definition filtering can be used to reduce complexity in api documentation.
