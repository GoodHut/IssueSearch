 URL : "https://github.com/Wynncraft/Issues/issues/8756" TITLE : site d wynncraft issue BODY : i was doing site d and had finished the shadow boss i went on to the 3rd and final boss and was able to kill him but he never dropped anything for me to get past and later re-spawned killing me while i was looking for the item he was supposed to drop, i don't want to deal with beating him on my own again and i was wondering why i wouldn't get the item from him. any info on this would be nice before i attempt to do this again thanks.
