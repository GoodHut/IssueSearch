 URL : "https://github.com/blue-systems/plasma-5.9/issues/72" TITLE : audio volume issues BODY : hello. i have 2 issues with audio volume management. 1. i am using volume keys. all seems to work, but often when volume is set to maximum, all applications have lower volume, like 60%. i click to volume icon, applications tab and set slider to 100% manually for all apps. so in general it working well, but after some time 1-2h of volume changing it stops moving application sliders, and volume is low on 'maximum' 2. in 'multimedia' section of system settings, i can't set notifications volume. when i drag slider, it returns back immediately. it never worked on my machine since plasma 5.8.2. so i don't have any notifications. please help resolve these issues. plasma 5.9.4, gentoo-hardened, kde-overlay unmasked, linux-4.9.15 + grsecurity with paxctld and exceptions for most kde core .
