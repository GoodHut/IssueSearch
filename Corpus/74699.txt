 URL : "https://github.com/m0ngr31/react-native-device-detection/issues/2" TITLE : feature request: iphonex BODY : @m0ngr31 - first and foremost we use this package in almost every page on our application so kudos for creating it. i was wondering if the package is still being actively supported? i'd be willing to open a pr for iphonex now that apple has that. would be similar to https://github.com/ptelad/react-native-iphone-x-helper but i believe the less packages you can bring in the better. let me know if you are accepting prs and i'll open one!
