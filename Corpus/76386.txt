 URL : "https://github.com/dispel/jak/issues/26" TITLE : jak + windows == :heart: BODY : it is not obvious what it would take to get jak working on windows. but plenty of people do their development from windows. if it is feasible let's make it happen. some open questions i have: what versions of windows would we even target? is that a valid question? how would we continually check that it is working as intended without using a ton of dev time on qa? what even is the best way to get a windows dev environment setup? find someone who is on windows naturally?
