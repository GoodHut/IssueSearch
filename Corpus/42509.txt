 URL : "https://github.com/vimeo/player.js/issues/104" TITLE : bitrate selection api BODY : hi there i noticed in regards to 39 there is a background option to provide chromeless features. something people have been asking for years. i have noticed however there is no feature to select or get bitrates like youtube so still requires the player ui to do such things. is there any plans to add this into the api similar to text track selection ? is there no plans at all for a proper chromeles feature similar to the background feature ?
