 URL : "https://github.com/react-toolbox/react-toolbox/issues/1316" TITLE : sidebar not a flexbox BODY : the classnames combined here https://github.com/react-toolbox/react-toolbox/blob/dev/components/layout/sidebar.js l17 do not evaluate as expected. the display style on the sidebar is evaluated to display: block despite setting classname to sidebar and having the following class in css. css .sidebar { display: flex; flex-direction: column; bottom: 0; } increasing the specificity as below fixes the issue for me. i'm not sure why this is happening. it seems like the display value is coming from here https://github.com/react-toolbox/react-toolbox/blob/dev/components/drawer/theme.css l15 . css aside.sidebar { display: flex; flex-direction: column; bottom: 0; }
