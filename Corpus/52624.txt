 URL : "https://github.com/ipython/ipykernel/issues/253" TITLE : constraints on id size BODY : a lot of messages contain strings that are typically 32 bytes hexadecimal strings. as i am working on a native implementation of the protocol, i realize that a lot of optimization is possible in e.g. comms if we know the size of the id in advance. basically, a comm contains is a string, and fixed-sized stack allocated strings would prevent requiring dynamic allocation when instantiating a comm. hence, after some discussions on gitter, a proposition is to require the ids specified in the jupyter messaging protocol to have a length of up to 32 bytes .
