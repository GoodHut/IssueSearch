BODY : okay, so i have downloaded this because i just want to wonder trade whilst i am afk well, in this case, af3ds . i have a new 3ds xl with luma cfw b9s my issue is that i know the pokemon ntr .exe file is connected since it reads the correct pokemon from box 1 slot 1, then i tested it with box 2 slot 1, all correct, so i know it is connected. i tried using input redirection through the rosalina menu and the .cia file. this is a step by step list on what i do exactly i load up the latest ntr cfw i press x and y to enable debugger just in case i use my combo buttons to open rosalina and start input redirection or try again with the .cia i go on pokemon sun, spamming a while it is loading i go to festival plaza and get online i open up pkmn ntr.exe and type in my n3dsxl ip address. it is connected to pkmn ntr.exe, as i am able to read in box 1, slot 1 so you're wondering what my issue is, right? well, my issue is when i go to the tools tab, click on wt bot and then i select box 1 slot 1 for 20 trades. the wt bot window shows it is doing something, then says bot finished successfully when nothing happened on my n3ds. i know i shouldn't be doing anything wrong, as i do the similar steps for ledybot and works 98% of the time for me when i play oras or xy. thanks for taking the time to read, and possibly help me guys or dev! i should also mention that pokemon sun is a digital copy, ripped straight from my cartridge before i sold it. so it is a legit copy. edit: no matter what box, trade number or slot number, the issue still remains for me.
