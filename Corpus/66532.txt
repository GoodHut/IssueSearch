 URL : "https://github.com/chrippa/ds4drv/issues/118" TITLE : multiple key mappings?? BODY : just wondering if this wonderful program supports duplicate key -> button mappings. i didn't see an example of mapping the same key to different controller buttons in the ds4drv.conf file. for example, both the left & right analog sticks being able move the mouse pointer. something like: map relative mouse movement to a analog stick rel_x = left_analog_x or right_analog_x rel_y = left_analog_y or right_analog_y
