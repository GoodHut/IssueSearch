 URL : "https://github.com/s-yadav/react-number-format/issues/61" TITLE : no decimal place BODY : i found just one way how to force component to use integer not decimal and it is to set decimalseparator= . i think it'll be more intuitive to use something like decimalprecision={0} , but in that case i had 0.undefined written in field. is it possible to fix it, or explain some better way how to do it?
