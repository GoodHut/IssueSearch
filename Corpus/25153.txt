 URL : "https://github.com/spotify/dh-virtualenv/issues/193" TITLE : v1.0 – more info BODY : backwards incompatible buildsystem: move files into build folder in install step instead of build step. thanks to ludwig hähne for the patch! could you be more specific and write more about this feature in the docs? some examples etc. i hope this enables us to just copy packages from local disk rather than install them. am i right?
