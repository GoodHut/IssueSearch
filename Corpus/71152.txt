 URL : "https://github.com/leonardvandriel/caffe2_cpp_tutorial/issues/17" TITLE : about usage of modelutil BODY : i read mnist.cc in your tutorial. i found that the operators are added in different way in addtrainingoperators. i know that the operator which has initializable parameters is actually two operators in initnet and predictnet perspectively. but for the operators which has no intializable parameters, can i add them through model.add.... functions rather than model.predict.add... functions?
