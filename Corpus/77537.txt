 URL : "https://github.com/qTip2/qTip2/issues/836" TITLE : new viewport breaks qtip BODY : i upgraded from v2.2.0 which worked fine to v3.0.3. both have plugins: tips and viewport. the new viewport plugin stops the tooltip from appearing. when i take out just the viewport plugin code out of the library, the tooltip works again, albeirt without the viewport functionality. here is my setup: $ function { $ document .on 'mouseover', '.notetooltip', function event { $ this .qtip { overwrite: false, content: { text: $ this .next 'div' }, position: { my: 'right center', at: 'left center', viewport: $ window , adjust: { method: 'shift' } }, show: { event: event.type, ready: true } }, event ; } } ; looked over the docs to see if anything has changed that my current setup code could have been made it obsolete with new version but i can't see anything.
