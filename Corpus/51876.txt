 URL : "https://github.com/claunchky/nero-theme/issues/1" TITLE : budgie desktop support BODY : hi, the readme mentions that this theme supports budgie. it is actually missing almost all of the budgie desktop styling as per https://github.com/budgie-desktop/budgie-desktop/tree/master/src/theme/3.20 so, will you be adding budgie support? otherwise, maybe just remove budgie from the readme? thanks.
