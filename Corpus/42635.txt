BODY : is the predictcount function supposed to work for logistic regression models, or just poisson glms? it is used to calculate estimated probabilities in a previous version of the stats 20x notes. however, the function appears to think every glm has a log link function. for logistic regression models, estimated probabilities are calculated by exponentiating the linear predictor, rather than using the inverse-logit function.
