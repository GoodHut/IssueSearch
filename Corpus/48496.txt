 URL : "https://github.com/ndaversa/hubot-jira-bot/issues/33" TITLE : search by jira number BODY : looks like we cant search by jira number since jql is search for 'text' so adding 'key' in the fields is not working to perform search by jira number. ex: bot-name jira search abc-4 https://jira.xxx.com/jira/rest/api/2/search body is { jql : text ~ 'abc-4' , startat :0, maxresults :5, fields : issuetype , status , assignee , reporter , summary , description , labels , project } any suggestions please!!
