 URL : "https://github.com/sindresorhus/pageres/issues/315" TITLE : issues with sizes BODY : howdy, i've been doing something like this with pageres. javascript const pageres = new pageres { delay: 2 } .src base_url, '384x79', '768x158', '1152x237' , { selector: ' someselector' } .dest __dirname .run .then => console.log 'your image has been screenshotted' where base_url is just a path to a local html file. the problem i'm encountering is that the sizes are all getting screenshot as the first 384x79 . any ideas? ps. it's totally kosher without using the selector option.
