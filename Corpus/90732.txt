 URL : "https://github.com/tilltnet/egor/issues/7" TITLE : standardize alter id name BODY : when alter-alter ties are not observed, this is irrelevant. when they are observed, there needs to be a way to link the alters to alter-alter ties. i see two solutions: 1. positionally: an .alter_ties for an ego becomes an actual matrix of mode list i.e., each cell is a list , which contains the attributes of that particular tie or null if no tie . this is arguably the most elegant solution, but it would require rewriting a lot of things. 2. relationally: .alters has a well-identified column of values unique to each ego, and .alter_ties has a column for tail and head of that tie. this is the current solution. if we stay with 2, we should probably add another attr to the egor object, say, alterid which might also be a part of the alter.design list , which tells egor which alters to link to which alter-alter ties.
