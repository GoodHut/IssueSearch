 URL : "https://github.com/APIs-guru/openapi-directory/issues/187" TITLE : header parameters misusage BODY : at least from what i could see in the github api implemented in swagger, the request parameter definitions are misused. for instance consider this example https://github.com/apis-guru/openapi-directory/blob/master/apis/github.com/v3/swagger.yaml l80 . you defined x-ratelimit-remaining header as a request parameter. although it should go into the respected response headers object.
