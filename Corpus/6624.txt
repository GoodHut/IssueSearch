 URL : "https://github.com/zyra/ionic2-super-tabs/issues/159" TITLE : aot build error BODY : when building with the new angular-cli, aot compilation is activated by default. the problem is that ionic2-super-tabs does not compile correctly: supertabs.html 10,70 : expected 0 arguments, but got 1. i think it's related the the ondrag = ondrag $event . the function does not accept any argument so the build fail. removing $event ondrag = ondrag should fix the aot issue.
