 URL : "https://github.com/MystK/delta-bot-three/issues/191" TITLE : lost all of my deltas BODY : i just received my approximately 289th delta on this comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/633hwm/cmv_some_individuals_with_downs_syndrome_are/dfrznpb/, and now i have 1. i even got the pm congratulating me on my first delta, which was kind of hilarious. something serious has gone wrong here. i don't know if it's a glitch or the result of some change made recently, but i'd say this is of high urgency to identify and fix.
