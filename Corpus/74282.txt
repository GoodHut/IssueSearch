 URL : "https://github.com/blatinier/pyhunspell/issues/32" TITLE : encoding problem python3 BODY : hey! i have a problem using hunspell with german words and i hope you can help me out. an example: python python 3.5.2 default, nov 17 2016, 17:05:23 gcc 5.4.0 20160609 on linux type help , copyright , credits or license for more information. >>> import hunspell >>> spellchecker = hunspell.hunspell '/usr/share/hunspell/de_de.dic', ... '/usr/share/hunspell/de_de.aff' >>> spellchecker.spell 'wörterbuch' true >>> spellchecker.suggest 'wörterbuhc' unicodedecodeerror: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xf6 in position 1: invalid start byte during handling of the above exception, another exception occurred: traceback most recent call last : file <stdin> , line 1, in <module> systemerror: <built-in method suggest of hunspell object at 0xb717d6d0> returned a result with an error set when i encode to utf-8 it works, but the result i get makes no sense: python >>> spellchecker.suggest 'wörterbuhc'.encode 'utf-8' 'westerburger' this seems to be very weird, since here https://datascience.blog.wzb.eu/2016/07/13/autocorrecting-misspelled-words-in-python-using-hunspell/ was done the exact same thing which apparently worked. i use it in a ubuntu vm with all the necessary packages installed.
