 URL : "https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/issues/17920" TITLE : httponly in cookies BODY : not even really sure if this is an issue but i've been referred here by woocommerce support. a website we've built has been audited by an external security firm on behalf of the client and we've been informed that two cookies that are set at checkout woocommerce_cart_hash and wp_woocommerce_session and they should be httponly and marked as secure, as should all cookies. is there any reason that they are not set as httponly and secure, and if we implemented all cookies to be httponly and secure do you know if anything would break or not work as it should?
