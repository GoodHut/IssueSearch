 URL : "https://github.com/dvddarias/rdocker/issues/10" TITLE : multi user problem BODY : for example we have 1 docker host, and 2 users, both want to use rdocker. when 1st come to host - script will create a /tmp/rdocker-forwarder.py with user1 permissions. 644 in my case then 2nd, takes permission denied while trying to overwrite it. my fix is to inject username to /tmp/rdocker-$user-forwarder.py name.
