 URL : "https://github.com/philc/vimium/issues/2765" TITLE : can we disable vomnibar? BODY : is there a user setting to disable the vomnibar from loading? it's causing an issue when inspecting a page with the chrome dev tools. focus jumps to the vomnibar html, instead of staying put on the element i was trying to inspect. i don't use the vomnibar much, so i'd be happy to just be able to stop it loading.
