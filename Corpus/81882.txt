 URL : "https://github.com/visualeyes/halcyon/issues/47" TITLE : accept header not working BODY : i tried following the instructions in the readme to get halcyon to output plain json if the accept header is simply application/json instead of application/hal+json , but it doesn't seem to be working. no matter how i fiddle with it, it always returns the hal formatted results with a content-type header of application/json in the response . i tried cloning the halcyon project and running the test project halcyon.tests.selfhost.mvc , which appeared to be setup the way the readme described, but i got the same results as with my own project. i feel like i'm missing something important about getting halcyon to handle the accept header correctly. any help would be greatly appreciated. thanks.
