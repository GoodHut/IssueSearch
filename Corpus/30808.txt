 URL : "https://github.com/WorldBrain/WebMemex/issues/134" TITLE : readme gifs too big BODY : in the new readme pages which are awesome , the gifs are anywhere from 10-20mb each. this creates a long init loading time on our repo and slows the browser down significantly whenever they're on the screen. ideas: - put gifs behind gh markdown dropdowns https://gist.github.com/citrusui/07978f14b11adada364ff901e27c7f61 by default - rerecord them capturing a smaller window size or screen res now they're at 2880 × 1598 , which is huge
