 URL : "https://github.com/tleunen/babel-plugin-module-resolver/issues/127" TITLE : alias on partial string? BODY : i have a set of react components all in the same folder a_la_lerna . these components will be published to npm under a namespace, all prefixed by the react- string, i would like to make them depend by each other, example: structure : /packages/foo/index.jsx // on npm will be @namespace/react-foo /packages/bar/index.jsx // on npm will be @namespace/react-bar foo/index.jsx : import bar form '@namespace/react-bar'; ... i would like to make webpack load the modules locally instead of npm while i'm developing, in practice, the import should be transpiled to: import bar form 'packages/bar';
