 URL : "https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5/issues/199" TITLE : osthreadjoin with timeout BODY : hi, two years ago i requested an osthreadjoin function and i'm happy that we have it now. but sometimes you don't want to wait forever for a thread termination. we need an osthreadjoin function with a timeout. this is useful when you shutdown your device and try to do it cleanly, requesting all the threads to exit and wait their termination with osthreadjoin . but if any thread is blocked or looping forever you want to force its termination and then shutdown. that means we need a timeout on the join function. you could have a look to the posix function pthread_timedjoin_np . in posix you also have pthread_tryjoin_np which could be useful. being closer to posix allows developer to easily port code to/from other systems. thank you, greg
