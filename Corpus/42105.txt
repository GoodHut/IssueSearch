 URL : "https://github.com/reactorlabs/rir/issues/5" TITLE : adjust benchmark time BODY : on our perf site http://ginger.ele.fit.cvut.cz/~oli/r-we-fast/ you can see that some benchmarks run for less than 1 second. those are useless. we should go through them and give them better defaults. to do so just change the default value for the execute function in each affected benchmark in benchmarks/shootout .
