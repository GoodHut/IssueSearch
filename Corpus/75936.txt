 URL : "https://github.com/ocrickard/Theodolite/issues/16" TITLE : implement working ranges BODY : we need something like working ranges in componentkit. something to allow components to listen for whether they're visible, nearing the viewport, or are being focused on by the user. i wrote a threadsafe ringbuffer like we have in working ranges: https://gist.github.com/ocrickard/d222f9d744fee2ad0fdee53625d42ded not sure if it's useful, but it could serve as a strong base for recording layouts on the ui thread inside the scroll component, and then reading them on a bg thread to traverse the hierarchy and do the frame computations.
