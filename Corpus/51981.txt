 URL : "https://github.com/NSI-IT/AUG-DEADDROP/issues/128" TITLE : ca cancel subscription BODY : as a user i would like to cancel subscription so that paypal doesn't make a recurring payment for next month since i am no longer interesting in using the system. - verify that a confirmation will be taken.
- verify that once the subscription is cancelled; user wont be able to login.
- verify that if user has paid for the month and ends the subscription before the end of the month; he can still use the app since he has paid already for that month.
