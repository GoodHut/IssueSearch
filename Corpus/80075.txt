 URL : "https://github.com/jamesdbloom/mockserver/issues/356" TITLE : synchronous server reset BODY : taking a look at the mockserverservlet class https://github.com/jamesdbloom/mockserver/blob/3060bbb872feb8e417c2e4b8e0f19ea5faa6890e/mockserver-war/src/main/java/org/mockserver/server/mockserverservlet.java i noticed, that both for clear and reset request the http status code 202 accepted is returned. as stated by the http specification https://www.w3.org/protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html , the request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed... the 202 response is intentionally non-committal . this is very inconvenient for testing, as after the execution of such a request, if it is not clear if the expectations & request logs where deleted, posterior checks might or might not, depending on when the requests are actually executed fail. the mock server should either: - execute this requests in a blocking manner return 200 once finished, preferred , or - provide some endpoint to check the process status of the accepted requests
