BODY : hello, i have my main api.raml file which contains all of the essentials: %raml 1.0 title: my api ... uses: ... types: ... /endpoint: get: response: ... in order to simplify this file, i externalized all libraries and types, so for example, i have: types: user: !include user.raml usertype: !include usertype.raml now if we want to reference the usertype inside the user.raml, intellij says it cannot find the reference. however, if i start up the raml api console, the type is resolved and everything is displayed nicely. i want to avoid having to do the following inside user.raml %raml 1.0 datatype ... properties: type: !include usertype.raml is there a way to get the plugin to recognize/resolve all types defined in my main api.raml file and reuse these inside other .raml files?
