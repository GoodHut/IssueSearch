 URL : "https://github.com/MachoThemes/epsilon-framework/issues/47" TITLE : backup page option name BODY : i'd rather you go the front page route https://github.com/machothemes/epsilon-framework/issues/45 , but if sticking with your current method: you have a rather complicated method of creating a prefixed option name: $theme = wp_get_theme ; $this->slug = $theme->get 'textdomain' ; $this->slug_sanitized = str_replace '-', '_', $theme->get 'textdomain' ; $this->hash = $this->calculate_hash ; $this->setting_page = get_option $this->slug_sanitized . '_backup_settings', false ; it'd be far easier to simply do this: $this->settings_page = get_option get_template . '_backup_settings', false ; or, use get_stylesheet if you want to save based on the active theme in case a child theme is in use . of course, it's entirely possible for the textdomain value and get_template to be very different. get_template is just simpler.
