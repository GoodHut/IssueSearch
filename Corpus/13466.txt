 URL : "https://github.com/jeroenrnl/zoph/issues/86" TITLE : upgrade to 0.9.5 BODY : i've just upgraded following the upgrade.md instructions. i hadn't gone to 0.9.4 it seems, and after upgrading my install still says 0.9.3 there are no instructions to update the cli scripts. i've been caught before with outdated cli, so was looking carefully for upgrade instructions. i'm sure there has been a change, the program is much faster at finding random photos from a massive database.
