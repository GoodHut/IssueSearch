 URL : "https://github.com/handsontable/react-handsontable/issues/3" TITLE : hottable with webpack BODY : hi, thank you for creating react compatible handsontable! looks very promising and i would love to git it try. one question i had is how to deal with webpack with react-handsontable. i was able to fix original handsontable webpack issue by implementing solution provided here https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/3718 . however when i try to use hottable, error says handsontable is not defined and i won't be able to display table. is there any way to fix this issue by any chance? seems like react community is already set to use webpack as a default option going forward and not been able to work with it as an out-of-the-box support is little bit painful. i really would love to use handsontable with react webpack : your feedback would be really appreciated.
