 URL : "https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-Android/issues/5775" TITLE : photo picker help BODY : we're receiving feedback that some of the actions in the new photo picker aren't clear. long-press multi-select isn't very discoverable for new users, and the three icons at the bottom can be confusing. after discussing various solutions, such as a help overlay, tutorial, etc., we decided on this simpler approach: add a toast explaining long-press, tap and hold to select more than one photo. this should appear the first three times the feature is accessed. change the wp media library title from select from media library to wordpress media library. change the device icon menu to show choose photo from device and choose video from device
