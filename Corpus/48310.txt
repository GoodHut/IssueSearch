 URL : "https://github.com/nunit/governance/issues/1" TITLE : review of projects.md BODY : hi @nunit/core-team ! this is the first of what will probably be lots of reviews of documentation about the governance of the nunit project. after some thought, i decided a bottom-up review would work best. that is, the more detailled docs will be reviewed before the higher-level ones. this has the advantage that each review concentrates on one thing and we can gradually build up to the big picture. for this issue, i'd like to get your comments on projects.md , located in the drafts folder: https://github.com/nunit/governance/blob/master/drafts/projects.md there are no changes to review, since it's a new document, please comment on the whole thing. note that i have added special comments headed reviewers: to point out questionable areas. key review points: is the categorization of projects ok? are all the projects where they belong? what about the ones i didn't know how to categorize? details of the text for these reviews, i'd appreciate getting some comment from every core-team member, if only to say that you have read it and see no problems. thank you! charlie ps: if you want to see the developing big picture, you can look at governance.md in the same folder. it's not ready for review at this point, however.
