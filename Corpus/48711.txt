 URL : "https://github.com/divmain/GitSavvy/issues/596" TITLE : signing fails via gpg BODY : related to 581 but not on windows. /usr/bin/git commit -q -f - failed with following output: gpg: cannot open /dev/tty': device not configured error: gpg failed to sign the data fatal: failed to write commit object on the terminal it works, and no password is asked. i guess it is cached or handled automatically with credential helper = osxkeychain since no interactin is actually required, is there any configuration possible which allows this to work?
