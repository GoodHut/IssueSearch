 URL : "https://github.com/shopgun/graphql-erlang/issues/143" TITLE : batch loading support BODY : not an issue per se, i'm just not sure how to do batch loading in graphql-erlang. i'm trying to use this optimization: dataloader https://github.com/facebook/dataloader to batch up individual queries into a big one. basically, in dataloader, a call to dataloader.load id will return a promise. at the next tick , all ids will be sent in a single batch query to save round trip time and all promises will be resolved. while deferring is already possible in graphql-erlang , joining is not as the concept of a next tick doesn't make much sense in erlang. is it possible to register a callback which will be called here: https://github.com/shopgun/graphql-erlang/blob/develop/src/graphql_execute.erl l912? it can inform the batch loader to start sending. alternatively, is there a better way to implement batch loading?
