 URL : "https://github.com/CuBoulder/lil_shrugger/issues/118" TITLE : add export for reports BODY : the export functionality would allow you to aggregate certain columns from a data table and spit out a csv file based on your selection. by default, each column would have its own column in the csv export and arrays would be concatenated into one column with a separator, like a comma. custom formatter logic could be added so the export wouldn't care about what a user has selected, but rather take all the available data, run the logic, and spit out the report.
