 URL : "https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1787" TITLE : box2d joints handling bug BODY : the way box2d joints are handled by urho is not valid. for now every time some joint parameter is changed, the joint gets recreated. it involves destruction of an old object, change of joint definition and then creation of a new joint with altered parameters. for most cases it might be a good way to handle this, despite the fact this is not so performant. but some joints have internal state which gets lost during the process. for example the prismatic joint with its lower and upper translation. limits are computed for rigid bodies during the creation of a prismatic joint. if bodies move away during the simulation due to gravity or a motor and then joint gets recreated, the limits are computed again but for bodies in other positions, which stretches or narrows the limits, which creates strange behaviors. i tried to change the joint parameter directly for example a motor speed without joint recreation and then it works correctly. are there any other reasons this is not implemented this way?
