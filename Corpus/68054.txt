 URL : "https://github.com/zetkin/www.zetk.in/issues/67" TITLE : register using facebook BODY : add a feature to register using facebook, and a button on the /register page. some consideration will need to be given to the best way to do this, for the user and technically. a lot of people use really old e-mail addresses on facebook, which they will not want to use for zetkin. unlike with legacy zetkin, there should be a middle-step after authenticating with facebook in which the user is allowed to submit another e-mail address. in these cases, the e-mail address will need to be verified, which is not necessary when sticking to the e-mail address from facebook in which case facebook acts as verification enough . this might require changes to the platform api.
