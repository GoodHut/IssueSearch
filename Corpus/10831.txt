 URL : "https://github.com/justifiably/docker-musicip/issues/1" TITLE : docs for docker. BODY : thanks for putting this together. could you add some docs for the handful of us that are running lms in docker. 😄 i tried to use docker pull justifiably/musicip but no builds have been deployed. if the build works then creating a dockerhub auto-build is pretty painless. 🤷‍♂️
