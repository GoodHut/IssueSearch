 URL : "https://github.com/PaylineByMonext/payline-php-sdk/issues/22" TITLE : sdk is broken since 4.52 BODY : greetings, we updated our production to 4.52 and we're touched by the cast warning recently introduced in paylinesdk . actually, any call to the api won't work until we manually fix the cast, that mean any payment or wallet creation wouldn't lead to success and it's really penalizing our production. it seems it has been fixed into this commit https://github.com/paylinebymonext/payline-php-sdk/commit/c4532ec22a8ff225771d4b70862afc255141cb77 but no release has been made since. any information to give ?
