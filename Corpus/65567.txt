an error in the wdl. in the example bad wdl attached the call to vcf_to_maf_task
has the line inputvcf=inputvcf but the inputvcf exists only
in the task but not at the workflow level but invoking wdltool 0.4 on it seems to _not_
cause an error. shouldn't it be saying the wdl has an error
because inputvcf does _not_ exist at the workflow level? i downloaded the wdltool from the latest release
https://github.com/broadinstitute/wdltool/releases/download/0.4/wdltool-0.4.jar the two wdls are attached. wdl_files.zip https://github.com/broadinstitute/wdltool/files/412067/wdl_files.zip wm8b1-75c:red_bug esalinas$ find .wdl -exec java -jar wdltool-0.4.jar validate {} \; wm8b1-75c:red_bug esalinas$ diff good.wdl bad.wdl 188c188
