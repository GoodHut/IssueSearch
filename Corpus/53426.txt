 URL : "https://github.com/JuliaCloud/AWS.jl/issues/104" TITLE : don't override display BODY : you are overloading display in order to customize output. this is the wrong way to do it â€” see the manual on custom pretty printing https://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.6/manual/types/ custom-pretty-printing-1 . to customize repl output, you should override base.show io::io, x::mytype and/or base.show io::io, ::mime text/plain , x::mytype , as explained in the manual. overriding display directly will break ijulia, juno, and other environments that have a custom display mechanism.
