 URL : "https://github.com/greshake/i3status-rust/issues/40" TITLE : add ci verification step BODY : prs and master for that matter are currently not checked for anything, potentially causing master not to build https://github.com/greshake/i3status-rust/issues/30 issuecomment-304526359 . i propose to add a simple ci configuration, using one of the numerous free ci solutions like travis ci https://travis-ci.org or circle ci https://circleci.com/ . ----- following is a very simple travis configuration .travis.yml which at least checks if a commit builds successfully: yaml language: rust rust: - stable - beta - nightly os: - linux matrix: allow_failures: - rust: nightly script: - cargo build -v - cargo test i have added cargo test although there aren't any tests yet. this will take the burden of remembering to add a test-run to the ci configuration once tests might be added.
