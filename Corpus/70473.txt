 URL : "https://github.com/crmarsh/discord-linux-bugs/issues/241" TITLE : webcam is always in use BODY : system: elementary loki 0.4.1 based on ubuntu 16.04.3 stack kernel: 4.10.0-40-generic release channel: canary build number: 7653 version hash: 7a1ce7d6472f3bcc924c756dcb6910dc41a60e14 after canary startup, powertop states that webcam usage is constantly at 100% even if i'm not using video chat or settings screen, minimized or not it doesn't matter. _for reference, i've checked skype for linux and webcam usage drops to 0% after startup finished and bumps up only if i'm actually using it._
