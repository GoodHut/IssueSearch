 URL : "https://github.com/flowtype/flow-for-vscode/issues/183" TITLE : syntax highlight broken BODY : bringing this over from https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/38071 i found no instance of this issue in a github search. <!-- do you have a question? please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode. --> <!-- use help > report issues to prefill these. --> - vscode version: 1.18.0 - os version: 10.13 high sierra steps to reproduce: 1. create a .js file that has react code 2. in the render method, using a for loop and an if statement nested within it, chain some methods like push . 3. incorrect syntax highlighting js // @flow for let i = postlen; i >= 0; i-- { if node { const element = node: any } } for let i = 0; i < postslen; i++ { if prevpost && prevpost.creatorid === post.creatorid && post.timestamp < prevpost.timestamp + 300 { postswithbreaks.push renderpost post, true } else { postswithbreaks.push renderpost post, false } } <!-- launch with code --disable-extensions to check. --> reproduces without extensions: didn't test i suspect it something to do with nesting of parentheses and multiple boolean operators in the if statement. when i add parentheses on the if statement to be more explicit, highlighting is corrected. this problem existed yesterday too before i upgraded to 1.18.0.
