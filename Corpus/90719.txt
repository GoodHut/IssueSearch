 URL : "https://github.com/r0man/sqlingvo.node/issues/1" TITLE : ssl connection to aws rds BODY : hi, i'm trying to connect to a postgres rds database over ssl using sqlingvo.node but hitting an error executing my query. my use case is a clourescript aws lambda that connect to a rds postgres db. the problem i get is that when i execute my query i get typeerror: pp.a ... .xd is not a function returned. using a local database everything works fine however for rds i need to add ssl=true and sslmode=verify-ca or sslmode=verify-full. any idea how to configure sqlinvgo.node to work over ssl with a cert.
