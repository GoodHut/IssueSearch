 URL : "https://github.com/TheShadyBunch/clean-water-mapping/issues/6" TITLE : changes to the model BODY : - to support the class standing, we will first need to create a new class named classstanding which is an enum with the values freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior. give each class a two character representation fr , so , jr and sr . - now add an attribute to student which holds the classstanding enum. - add getter and setter for the classstanding - make a new 3 param constructor which includes name, major and class standing. keep the old two param constructor for backwards compatibility and use constructor chaining to give a default class standing of freshman. - change the tostring method to contain the class standing also. - in the model facade, there is a method called replacestudentdata. you will need to add a line of code there to update the classstanding along with the name and major.
