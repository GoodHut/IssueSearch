 URL : "https://github.com/davidfstr/rdiscount/issues/139" TITLE : toc generation unclear BODY : while converting markdown to html it is unclear on how to generate a table of contents. enabling :generate_toc adds the a tags, however a toc isn't added. in searching for a solution it appears a toc tag needs to be added to the markdown which makes sense however i cannot find any documentation on what that tag is or how to specify it. grepping the code for 'toc. token' yields no hits, and the token isn't mentioned in the documentation http://www.rubydoc.info/github/davidfstr/rdiscount/master/rdiscount generate_toc-instance_method . please clarify how to specify the toc token in code, thanks.
