 URL : "https://github.com/ianjwhitmore/ecotrust-northwest-community-forests/issues/12" TITLE : light green color BODY : flipping through pages, i think we need to set some parameters about the use of the light green color. in some instances, it works for me - big blocks of color seem ok, but when it's used for a subhed or an outlined button, anything small and thin, it makes the item hard to see. what are our options for incorporating our other colors in here?
