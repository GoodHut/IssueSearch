 URL : "https://github.com/debrief/debrief/issues/2172" TITLE : better font s for classic BODY : the swing fonts look a bit boring in debrief-classic. specifically, the from deep blue c ltd when the app first opens, and the toolbar tab titles once an app is open. this font is used for debrief branding: https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/roboto it would be good if the from deep blue c used that font. i'm less clear about the fonts in the toolbars. maybe a larger font? or one that isn't bold?
