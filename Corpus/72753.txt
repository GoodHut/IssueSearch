 URL : "https://github.com/alphagov/stagecraft/issues/494" TITLE : celery is leaking memory BODY : in the new environment, celery is leaking ram until the container uses all available. celery has recorded a few sources of memory leaks, almost all fixed by v4.0. unfortunately our use of django-celery v3.2.1 precludes the upgrade because django-celery won't work with celery >= 4.0 yet. celery > 4.0 has direct support for django, so we need to investigate how much effort is involved in migrating the code to use celery 4 rather than celery 3.1.25 and django-celery 3.2.1
