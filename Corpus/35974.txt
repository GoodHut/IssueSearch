 URL : "https://github.com/avalonmediasystem/avalon/issues/2701" TITLE : fix streaming on aws BODY : mejs4 with hls.js now makes xhrequest to m3u8 and ts files, so having cors header is a requirement for streaming servers. i've read that when using signed cloudfront urls with cookie, allow is considered too permissive and hence not allowed. need to allow only the specific domain for avalon web. this means the s3 derivative bucket policy in cloudformation script needs updating as well.
