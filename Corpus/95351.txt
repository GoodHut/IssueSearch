BODY : there have been many mentions of something needing to be done with cryptab. can you @oberon2007 explain a bit more about your idea for this? i have little experience with encryption. based on what i gather from arch wiki, cryptab is for decrypting partiotions other than / so that fstab can mount them. the way i see it, encryption options are very complicated and personal issue, and we don't have default encryption setup. and there is no tool to easily generate crypttab that i know of. this being the case, it seems to me that scripting its generation might be out of scope for the installer. correct me if i'm wrong, would be cool to have if there is existing tool for it. but the way i see it, we currently provide the tools that user needs to set it up themselves. if we want to offer an easy option for encrypted $home, we could try setting up it via ecryptfs like ubuntu does. this was suggested by @torvic.
