 URL : "https://github.com/atmelcorp/atmel-software-package/issues/41" TITLE : spi cs question BODY : i've been configuring an spi device on the sama5d2-xplained rev.b board, and i've noticed that there seems to be only 4 selectable cs lines per spi device npcs0.. 1.. ect . i want to run more than 4 devices on one bus and obviously this would not let me do that. i feel i am missing a key component here as it doesn't really make sense to limit an spi bus to only 4 devices all the way up to the chip design. just fyi i know i can use gpio to do more devices but i haven't found a way to incorporate that with the softpack bus object. basically what i'm asking is if there is something i am missing? i am mostly curious as i've never really seen it done this way.
