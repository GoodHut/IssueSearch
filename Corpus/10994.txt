 URL : "https://github.com/jesseditson/fs-router/issues/4" TITLE : error on windows BODY : hi @jesseditson, they are some issues on windows. first, create folder like :params it's not permitted by default on windows. and the second, it's that on windows your router doesn't work ! it's because of windows' paths. it's like \\foo\\bar so when you have r.match req.url , the regex doesn't work. on line 58 you can replace this : route.path = '/' + path.relative routesdir, routefile .replace extpattern, '' by this : route.path = '/' + path.relative routesdir, routefile .replace extpattern, '' // fix for windows users route.path = route.path.replace /\\/, '/' ; so the regex is right and your router works : ps: i can't make a make pull request because of the folder's name in your test folder.
