 URL : "https://github.com/mricon/rev-proxy-grapher/issues/3" TITLE : support for zones? BODY : i would like to tag some of my cluster items as being part of a zone. a zone is a subset of a subnet. for example two geographical locations sharing the same subnet or in my case vms sharing the same network. what do you think? is is something that has a chance to be implemented? ps: nmap won't be able to recognize them on its own.
