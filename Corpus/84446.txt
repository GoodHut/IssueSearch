 URL : "https://github.com/greymd/tmux-xpanes/issues/62" TITLE : customizable tmux command BODY : tmux-xpanes internally uses tmux command as the default executor of the tmux. however, i imagines that someone wants to use tmux -2 as the default commands. my idea is... define environment variable tmux_xpanes_exec . xpanes uses the environment variable as the command. if it's empty, tmux is just used. sh $ export tmux_xpanes_exec= tmux -2 $ xpanes 1 2 3 4 => then, tmux -2 will internally be used.
