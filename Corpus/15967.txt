 URL : "https://github.com/nickstanisha/CIFAR-10_data/issues/2" TITLE : git lfs bandwidth BODY : it seems like when _anybody_ clones or downloads this repository, bandwidth from my personal lfs data plan is used. i've reached out to github personnel, but it doesn't seem like a change will be implemented any time soon. i'll look for somewhere else to store the file and link to it from here.
