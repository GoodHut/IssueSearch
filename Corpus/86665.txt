 URL : "https://github.com/OHDSI/SqlRender/issues/58" TITLE : impala needs concat tests BODY : due to an error we're seeing over at ohdsi/achilles 191, this is due to some concatenation changes that were made for impala, but there's no test cases for translating concatenation for impala. we will need corresponding tests for oracle if we are going to support mssql concat translation into oracle.
