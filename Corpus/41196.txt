 URL : "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/6614" TITLE : zlib has disappeared BODY : obviously this isn't your doing, but http://zlib.net/zlib-1.2.8.tar.gz and http://zlib.net/zlib-1.2.9.tar.gz are no longer on that server. the new http://zlib.net/zlib-1.2.10.tar.gz released yesterday is there. because dependencies are downloaded as needed this is breaking the build.
