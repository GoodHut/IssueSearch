 URL : "https://github.com/LemarinelNet/piDrummer/issues/2" TITLE : choose linux distribution BODY : a choice must be made for the best linux distribution to be used. until now, dietpi and tinycore seems reasonable choices. - tinycore loads in ram and runs from ram - dietpi runs from sd , but can be set read only, so power failure should be less destructive on file system. however, tinycore should be more robust to power failures !
