 URL : "https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/api-python/issues/11" TITLE : why the nwb_ ? BODY : why are the core parts of file , utils , etc named as nwb_xxx ? it seems unnecessary given that the main package is already called nwb , and in the examples when they're imported, they are already renamed w/ import nwb.nwb_utils as utils . maybe this is a minor point but it'd be good to streamline the api to follow conventions of other major python projects in the numpy ecosystem
