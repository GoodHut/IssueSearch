 URL : "https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim/issues/815" TITLE : keybindings for vim-org BODY : i am customizing some keymaps for vim-orgmode. but i find some problems in choosing the keymaps. by default, the vim-org use <localleader> and a quick fix is to use c-c as <localleader> . however, this solution cannot take advantage from spacevim's help info after spc . therefore, i have some questions for the key mode in the spacevim 1. how to write a spacevim keymode to display help info and prepare for the following keymaps? like spc and spc t 2. how to ensure the key mode only works in org files. because, in other code files, i would like to use c-c for vim-slime. thanks a lot for developing spacevim~
