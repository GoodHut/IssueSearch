BODY : hi, i tried to connect a 1w 8 ohm external speaker to the respeaker core and i am not able to get sound on it. play and madplay are playing on earphones plug only even if not connected and aplay seems to output on the speaker but is it just white noise. my .asoundrc file: pcm.!default { type asym playback.pcm { type plug slave.pcm hw:0,0 } capture.pcm { type plug slave.pcm hw:0,0 } } from schematic i assume that on speaker breakout connector, the square is the positive line. could you please confirm ? do you have any idea ? thanks
