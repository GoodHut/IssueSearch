 URL : "https://github.com/pellierd/pddl4j/issues/24" TITLE : parse request via string BODY : hi again, this is not really an issue, but a feature request. at the moment, if i didn't oversee some functionality it is only possible to parse extern files. if i have already loaded the pddl file to my program for whatever reason, then i have to write it back to the file to use your parser. id be interested in a direct string input, maybe even for parts of the pddl say only parsing one action. not sure if that is possible with your architecture however. kind regards richard
