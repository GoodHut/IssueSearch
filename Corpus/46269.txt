 URL : "https://github.com/Automattic/sensei/issues/1717" TITLE : looking for some help BODY : hello, i apologize if this isn't the right place to be asking this question. i'm not exactly sure of the relation between courses and lessons. is a course considered a taxonomy of a lesson? here's what i'm trying to do: inside a single lesson, i'm trying to add some php that basically says if current lesson is part of course-name { //do this } could someone please steer me in the right direction? thanks!
