 URL : "https://github.com/dmanjunath/node-redshift/issues/22" TITLE : use with aws lambda BODY : hello, is it possible to use this within a lambda function? i inserted my nodejs code that was working on my local machine into an aws lambda function and received the error error: cannot find module 'node-redshift'. i then uploaded the zipped module after downloading from git as it's own lambda function and received the error errormessage : cannot find module '/var/task/index' . is there a way around both these issues, to enable the use of node-redshift within an aws lambda function? thanks, nick
