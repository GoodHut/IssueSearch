 URL : "https://github.com/mikera/core.matrix/issues/312" TITLE : poor stability of solve BODY : i am trying to do a linear solve with a poorly conditioned, but not terribly conditioned, matrix sigma symmetric, positive definite the eigenvalues of sigma are :s la/svd sigma vectorz/vector 0.00944222396770215,0.007705139713474439,0.006118795643968743,0.003412358080515295,0.0031039370984308505,0.0024409586692006042,0.0023054287904142974,0.0019385205264753872,0.001546173882624919,2.480022617777184e-4 when i do my linear solve la/solve sigma bols , the result is nil. i am using the vectorz implementaiton of core.matrix. i wouldn't expect to get nil for such a matrix. any ideas what is going on here?
