 URL : "https://github.com/WarzoneMC/Warzone/issues/100" TITLE : warzone custom item BODY : in minehut, when connecting to warzone, we should have a custom item like a diamond sword, iron sword or bow or something that'd separate us with all the other servers. this will be easy to see which server is warzone on the list, so you dont have to go through a whole 4-6 lines just to find which one is warzone to join. if you cant buy it in their store, i believe just asking luuke might do the trick!
