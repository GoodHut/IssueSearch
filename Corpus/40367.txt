 URL : "https://github.com/donShakespeare/TinymceWrapper/issues/4" TITLE : tw and media sources BODY : i may have things configured wrong, but elfinder seems to have trouble when an image tv has a media source for the context the resource is in. modx prepends the media source's baseurl when producing the image tag. it also does so when producing the thumbnail for the tv value's preview in the manager. in the front end, the site_url is prepended to all of that by the base href tag. so, if the media source baseurl is assets/images/ and the file is picture.jpg, the correct content of the tv's input on the create/edit resource page would be picture.jpg. elfinder is putting this there for me: /addons/assets/images/compass-vector.jpg, so the image tag is invalid and there is no preview in the manager.
