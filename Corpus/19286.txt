 URL : "https://github.com/pushtype/push_type/issues/34" TITLE : 404 error handling BODY : when pushtype can't find a node, it raises activerecord::recordnotfound https://github.com/pushtype/push_type/blob/master/core/app/controllers/front_end_controller.rb l41 . i realised that i can add a rescue_from handler to my applicationcontroller in order to handle this gracefully, but this isn't documented. it would be helpful to add some doc for this, but i actually think it would be better to ensure that the permalink route doesn't match unless the permalink exists in the database. then, users can put other routes after the mount_push_type call and define their own handling for 404s or just let rails do its default thing, rendering public/404.html .
