 URL : "https://github.com/cake-contrib/Cake.Prca/issues/22" TITLE : improve filtering by path BODY : currently filtering by path is done by converting path of the modified file and issue to strings and compare them. there might be cases where this leads to wrong results eg. if .. is used in one of the paths. if the root repo url, to which both paths are relative, is passed to the settings object it should be possible create full absolute paths out of the relative paths and compare them. this will lead to a breaking change though.
