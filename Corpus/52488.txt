 URL : "https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-angular/issues/34" TITLE : combine mobx with rxjs BODY : i've read the following here https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/4austh/why_isnt_rxjs_more_popular_are_there_bad_parts/?st=j443wqi9&sh=b491d6ef > rxjs helps you deal with events, mobx helps you deal with values again, like a spreadsheet . you will find that the latter works more intuitively and high-level in most cases. but combining both is also a very powerful combination since its known that rxjs observables are first class citizens in angular, i wonder if there is a way to combine them together with mobx's state management? what are the benefits from doing so? what use cases? does anyone have a working example?
