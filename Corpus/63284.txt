 URL : "https://github.com/davisking/dlib/issues/504" TITLE : dlib community channels BODY : hi, @davisking , i recently found dlib and wanted to say it is great, really. i think dlib deserves better community facilities than sourceforge communities. i'd like to suggest: 1. dlib gitter channel. 2. dlib forum based on discourse https://www.discourse.org/ with math equation support using mathjax https://www.mathjax.org/ with the mathjax plug in https://meta.discourse.org/t/mathjax-plugin-supports-math-notation-using-latex/12826 . these solutions will enable better knowledge flow between dlib's users. thank you.
