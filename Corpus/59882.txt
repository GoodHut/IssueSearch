 URL : "https://github.com/biocore/american-gut-web/issues/649" TITLE : utf8 participant names BODY : if you log in as kit fdn_wsjdr, hover over human samples and the single participant and then try to click on the name, the sample overview is not shown. i figure it is because of utf-8 issues in the generated html page. is it possible to do an escaping within the templates, here sitebase.html? ag_data.get_menu_items skid retrieves unescaped strings directly from the database :-/
