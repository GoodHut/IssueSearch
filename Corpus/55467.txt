 URL : "https://github.com/rjanicek/liquidfun-rust/issues/6" TITLE : is this project alive? BODY : hi, i'd like to use liquidfun and rust for a simple game project and came across this repo. just wondering what the status is of these bindings, considering that they haven't been updated for about 2 years? would this be my best option for using an up to date version of liquidfun from rust, or would i be better off trying to create new bindings, possibly using bindgen? thanks
