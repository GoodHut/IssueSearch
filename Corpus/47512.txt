 URL : "https://github.com/EvilPeanut/EvilBook/issues/129" TITLE : player position reset BODY : add a command for tycoon and up for: resetting a players location to /hub or world's 0,100,0 point or world's /spawn even if they are offline or online reason: i get this issue every month when a person logs on it crashes the server due to there location. aka a bugged chunk. ik you can fix the chunks but they always appears. so i need it for taking people out of the bugged location when they are inside of it instead of asking you to do it every time.
