 URL : "https://github.com/JacquesCarette/literate-scientific-software/issues/253" TITLE : precision of calculations BODY : i have been trying to fix the failing test cases and came across a problem. in solarheatingwateronly\python\testing\energytest.py, lines 64 and 65 keep failing because, as far as i can tell, the actual value is not within the expected error range. in this case, i was using the equation params.c_w params.mw temp - params.tinit to calculate the new expected energy values without pcm and this worked fine for every other test case except the aforementioned last two values obtained from solarheatingwateronly\python\testing\loadparamstest.py . however, if i change the precision of the error 1e-9 to 1e-8 the code runs fine. to this end, is the factor of 10 change acceptable or is there some other approach i should take in fixing this error?
