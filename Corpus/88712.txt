 URL : "https://github.com/mapbender/data-manager/issues/2" TITLE : only 5000 entries visible BODY : if you implement the example configuration from the main page , the application shows only 5000 entries in the left table, even if the database table has many more rows. because these 5000 entries are the first ones of the database table, the last inserted entry isn't visible for viewing and editing. changing the values for _pagelength: 12_ and _paging: true_ has no effect of the number of 5000 entries.
