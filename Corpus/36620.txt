 URL : "https://github.com/mdmsoft/yii2-admin/issues/334" TITLE : i18n for menu label. BODY : hi, i have a little problem about i18n. at line 205 of file components/menuhelper.php , it's use $menu 'name' as label title directly, but sometimes i want to make an i18n app, so i hope the label title generated by \yii::t method, not use $menu 'name' directly. any suggestions here?
