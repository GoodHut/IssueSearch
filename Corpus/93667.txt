 URL : "https://github.com/MOARdV/AvionicsSystems/issues/96" TITLE : alternate shader for lines BODY : currently, i use particles/additive, which is okay ... but it is partially transparent, so the lines i render are not opaque. look into a different shader, or altering additive so it's not making partially-transparent lines.
