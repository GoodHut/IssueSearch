 URL : "https://github.com/stchris/untangle/issues/50" TITLE : outdated version on pypi BODY : hello dear friend, thanks for your awesome work, however the version here on github is way ahead than the one on pypi. do you think it would possible to send a minor version on pypi ? https://pypi.python.org/pypi/untangle/json this json file is so old and it gives us some trouble because no classifier is reported in your package... it flags the package as non python3 compatible and thus we have many issues with our continuous integrations services ... i would greatly appreciate a little update on pypi or at least to get a date when you think releasing. i can help you fixing this if you want to and implement an automatic github and pypi release when you commit a new tag. would you be interested @stchris ? thanks for your time, best regards, jonathan
