 URL : "https://github.com/amberframework/amberframework.org/issues/43" TITLE : move off of heroku BODY : lets move the site from heroku to digital ocean or aws. benefits this will allow us to run a fast database, and not worry about the size of assets. also the site will probably load faster after it hasn't been hit for a bit. ssl can handled on server instead of cloudflare which is more secure. i'm willing to host it on one of my servers if there is any interest in this.
