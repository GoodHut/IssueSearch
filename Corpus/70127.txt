 URL : "https://github.com/tvrenamer/tvrenamer/issues/144" TITLE : upgrade to new tvdb api BODY : thetvdb implemented a new, json-based api a while ago. they are really discouraging people from using the old api, and plan to shut it down within six months. note that one of the very specific test-cases tvrenamer uses, steven seagal: lawman , no longer works with the old api. the show is not found with the query we create, nor with any reasonable query we could create. unlike the other issues i've opened : this is not something i've done already. i'd be very happy to see someone else get this done!
