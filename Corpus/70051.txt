 URL : "https://github.com/alanjds/drf-nested-routers/issues/92" TITLE : update release on pypi? BODY : hi, i've included the github master of drf-nested-routers in our project and it's really working well, seems to do exactly what we need. we'd really prefer to include a pypi release in our deps rather than building the library for each release, do you have a timescale for the next pypi release? thanks!
