 URL : "https://github.com/NemProject/NanoWallet/issues/158" TITLE : about handling messages BODY : about handling messages with nanowallet, you can send a message by hex, encrypt it and send it. however, these two are implemented by javascript so that they can not be selected at the same time. however, ncc can select both simultaneously and can transmit. messages sent at the ncc are received by the nanowallet as encrypted hex messages. i want you to unify either whether we can select both of these parts or only one. in addition, if hex is specified, it can transmit up to 1024.5 characters. however, the remaining character count is displayed as -0.5. if encrypt is specified, more than 975 characters can not be sent. the remaining character count is 49 characters. both are tests of alphabet and numbers only. because it is a detailed place, please respond when you have time.
