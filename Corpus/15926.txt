 URL : "https://github.com/bep/s3tlsproxy/issues/1" TITLE : get a better name BODY : while this is mainly a tool motivated by my own need, i'm sure there are others that will find this useful. i plan to get this into a solid state with good test coverage. and even if the current name s3tlsproxy covers what it currently does, it is a mouthful and may not be accurate in the future i may add more storage providers in addition to amazon s3 . anyone got a good name for this?
