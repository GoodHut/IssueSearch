 URL : "https://github.com/dutchcoders/transfer.sh/issues/80" TITLE : customize the site layout? BODY : is there a way to alter the site layout to one's unique needs? this is a great tool, but the transfer.sh branding everywhere confuses our customers who visit it. i'd like to be able to alter it so it looks at least similar to our branding without of course removing the reference and fork link because we're not trying to steal credit . i'm running this via the docker container. i can modify the html/css pages if i could only find them. thanks!
