 URL : "https://github.com/reversebias/mitosis/issues/5" TITLE : nrf sdk 11 link is wrong BODY : for sdk 11 i'd rather point here: https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nrf5_sdk/ than here as in your readme: https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/nordic/products/nrf5-sdk/nrf5-sdk-v12-zip/54291 because there are no links to the previous versions and sdk 12 apparently no longer has nrf51822 support. p.s. also a teeny tiny suggestion could you please upload your precompiled qmk firmware too and make sure it all works together? it'd make things much easier for beginners. thanks!
