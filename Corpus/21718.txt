 URL : "https://github.com/OpenSSE/crypto-tk/issues/4" TITLE : get rid of openssl BODY : now that libsodium is used in the cryptographic toolkit since the merge of pr 3, we should try to remove all the dependencies to openssl. also, openssl is actually terrible so it is not a bad idea in terms of security. for symmetric key primitives, we can directly use libsodium's api. for asymmetric crypto, there are two primitives, trapdoor permutations and incremental hashing. for tdp, we can embed mbedtls' implementation. for elliptic curve multiset hash, we will have to wait for the implementation of elligator2 in libsodium cf. jedisct1/libsodium 628 .
