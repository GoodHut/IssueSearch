 URL : "https://github.com/47deg/freestyle/issues/251" TITLE : rename exec ? BODY : as it depends of the target type whether or not something is actually executed, the name exec is a bit confusing. there is already the precedent of the method run used by kleisli , statet and writert in cats and in all ? the monad transformers in scalaz and this also doesn't run something, but if we can come up with a better name, we don't have to follow these bad practices.
