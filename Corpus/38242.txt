 URL : "https://github.com/freelawproject/courtlistener/issues/652" TITLE : opinion parse hiccup BODY : in white v. pauly https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/4374579/white-v-pauly/ , the opinion parser did not pick up ashcroft v. al-kidd. this is strange because the citation looks fine -- nothing unusual -- in the text, to wit: today, it is again necessary to reiterate the longstand- ing principle that “clearly established law” should not be defined “at a high level of generality.” ashcroft v. al-kidd, 563 u.s. 731, 742 2011 . worth checking? i am going to add in the cite by hand for now.
