 URL : "https://github.com/Raybuntu/LibreELEC.tv/issues/11" TITLE : tmdb scrapper issue BODY : i'm running rb-krypton14 and having issues with movies scrapping. every time i have tried for the last few days i am met with the message unable to connect to remote server when scrapping the movie library, there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with the tmdb site it is all up and working correctly and they have verified this for me as well. not sure if this is purely an issue just for me or if anyone else has been experiencing it, is this a known issue at all?
