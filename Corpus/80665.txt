 URL : "https://github.com/DiegoRBaquero/fb-messenger/issues/32" TITLE : unsupported post request BODY : permission for the user's profile information in a messenger bot should be implicitly granted when a user begins a 1:1 thread with the bot for the first time . my bot is still in sandbox mode not sure if that is the issue , but with my own personal messenger account where i started the conversation with my bot -> my bot does not have access to my user profile. it gets the following error: {u'error': {u'message': u unsupported post request. object with id 'page_scoped_user_id' does not exist, cannot be loaded due to missing permissions, or does not support this operation. please read the graph api documentation at https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api , u'code': 100, u'type': u'graphmethodexception', u'fbtrace_id': u'ev1g0m7kvxe', u'error_subcode': 33}} do you know why???? thanks!
