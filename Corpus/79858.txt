 URL : "https://github.com/stonedDiscord/serverD/issues/32" TITLE : suggestion : load option BODY : you might not go for this one ,you might go for it, but i was thinking about this recently ; what if it were possible for a person to adjust how many characters are loaded, by default, fro their server? for example. say i have 240 characters on the roster. i can choose for the server to load 100 by default for those who connect to it. if a person wants the rest, they would use /loadall or something similar. the same can be applied to music. this would be done for the sake of speeding up connection to a server, but also would help those people who still have older clients... like those peeps who still use 1.7.5 for example.....
