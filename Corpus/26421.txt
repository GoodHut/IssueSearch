 URL : "https://github.com/ozydingo/despecable/issues/4" TITLE : auto doc generation BODY : since we're all about making api docs easy, and since we have all the information we need, let's add a rake task or something similar that can automatically generate a boilerplate api doc for the given despecable controller actions. first pass we can look through the code. but it'd be hella cool if we could define a new reader class that had different definitions of the integer , string , etc methods. we would need to load these actioncontroller subclasses carefully.
