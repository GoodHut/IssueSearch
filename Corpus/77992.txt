 URL : "https://github.com/nlbdev/pipeline/issues/123" TITLE : page count on about page BODY : the page counter on the about page om boken currently counts sheets instead of pages, so for two-sided duplex pefs, that should be multiplied with 2 to get the correct number of pages. @karirudjord how many pages are there in a one-sided book? do we count the backside of each page as a page? i suppose not?
