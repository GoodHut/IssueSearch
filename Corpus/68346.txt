 URL : "https://github.com/zalando/connexion/issues/405" TITLE : returning json and html BODY : hi, based on the requested content type i want my api to return either json or html. the latter is for non technical people to allow them some basic browsing of the api. i don't understand how to do the mapping between the yaml file and the python functions. the produces directive of the open api spec is too wide. also it is not an aspect of the api definition. the information produces _application/json_ and _text/html_ is correct and actually precise enough. my current approach theoretical : yaml path _/pets_ maps to function _api.pets ._ here i would inspect the incoming requested content type and then delegate to either _api.pets_json _ or _api.pets_html _. there must be a better way to do this. some decorator magic maybe? many thanks
