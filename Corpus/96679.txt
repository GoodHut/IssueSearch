 URL : "https://github.com/Pterodactyl/Panel/issues/302" TITLE : feature request: usernames BODY : it requires an administrator to configure a username, first name, and last name for a user during account setup, thus requiring the administrator to know what username that particular user would like as well as what their first and last name are. i think it would make more sense to simply plug in the user's email address and allow the user to select their own username once they receive the email.
