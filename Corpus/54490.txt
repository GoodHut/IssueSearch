 URL : "https://github.com/mach0/mutant/issues/7" TITLE : get row, col of raster BODY : hi, i love this tool. i do a lot of raster work and need to test things in my code. for example, i will visually inspect a landsat image and see where the clouds are, and i use mutant for things like checking if a pixel is saturated, etc. a feature that would be extremely useful would be two extra columns under 'table' tab that had row, col in addition to x, y coordinates. this way one could get the row, col of a numpy.ndarray of the raster, and use this for efficient testing of other analyses! someone has written some code here https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/166204/qgis-row-column-of-point-in-raster that should do it, i would do it myself, but i haven't made a plugin yet, and i think this would add to mutant's already great functionality. cheers,
