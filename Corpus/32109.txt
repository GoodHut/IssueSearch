 URL : "https://github.com/google/shaka-player/issues/887" TITLE : transmux ts to fmp4 BODY : on platforms that support transport stream via mediasource, we are able to play ts content. currently, that is just edge and chromecast. safari is not working due to 743. this is consistently surprising to developers, and not everyone can transmux their content to fmp4 ahead of time. developers expect that working content will work everywhere. to meet this expectation, we should start offering transmuxing of ts content in the browser. we should optimize this, if needed, to reduce impact on cpu and battery life. if the process is too expensive, we should warn developers and provide guidance on transmuxing content en masse on the server, to reduce the burden on clients. we should examine the transmuxing implementation of hls.js https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js which is also apache-licensed before we begin work. there may be a way to collaborate with hls.js https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js to reuse their transmuxer rather than build a new one.
