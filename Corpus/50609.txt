 URL : "https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/10375" TITLE : 2d editor enhancements BODY : hi everyone, i plan to work on the 2d editor to make it more modern. i opened this issue to discuss what and how the changes should be implemented. here is a list of what could be added: control nodes - display the margin values when moving a node - grid and guides - implement guides - implement top and left rulers - smart snapping: snap anchors / nodes to the grid / guides / align with other nodes, etc... - display the grid behind the selected node, but above the selected node's parents. - implement a smart grid that align with the rulers, thus depending on the zoom level. other - add a local/global button that could: - rotate the view to align with the selected node or its parent - display the grid relative to the node, - if it is implemented, make the smart grid/rulers display relative values instead of absolue ?
