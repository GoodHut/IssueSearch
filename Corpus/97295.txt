 URL : "https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/issues/13808" TITLE : generating php insert code BODY : is there anyway using php to generate an insert code for php? in other words, writing these php pdo insert statements is very repetitive. i wish phpmyadmin had the option to select columns on the structure page and then send it to a template where it can generate the php pdo code that i can copy and paste. same thing for other queries such as select or update. it wouldn't be too hard to code... does anything like this exist?
