 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-eslint/issues/330" TITLE : not working on new install BODY : i installed the eslint module and opened up a javascript file, expecting it to just work as i have an eslint rc file and eslint installed globally. i got no highlighting even when making obvious error, so i check the command palette and tried enable eslint, and got command 'eslint.enable' not found i'm not sure where to go next...
