 URL : "https://github.com/engelsystem/engelsystem/issues/322" TITLE : first time angel flag BODY : hi, we had some major problems with angels on the last congress 33c3 not appearing to their shifts and/or not knowing how to treat fellow nerds. in order to prevent shifts consisting only of first time angels i suggest implementing an first time angel flag/checkbox. an additional check has to be performed that prevents angels with that flag to add themselves to shifts that dont allready contain someone without that flag. pseudocode: if userhasflag == firsttime && usersinshift == 0 { //cant add to shift has to wait for angel without flag to be in that shift }else{ //added to shift }
