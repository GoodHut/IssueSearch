 URL : "https://github.com/juhgiyo/EpPathFinding.cs/issues/11" TITLE : returning failed path BODY : hey i found that the astarfinder was returning paths the lead to... nowhere in particular. i'm assuming what happened was the finder found no suitable paths, and simply returned the path back from the most recently searched node. my solution to this problem was to change this: if openlist.count == 0 return node.backtrace node ; ...to... if openlist.count == 0 && node == endnode return node.backtrace node ; not sure if that fits what you were aiming for, but it makes it infinitely more useful to me.
