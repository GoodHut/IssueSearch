 URL : "https://github.com/edzer/sfr/issues/154" TITLE : st_cast gc loses crs BODY : i need clarification before a pr for this. r library sf example st_read two examples where the geometrycollection casting drops crs st_cast st_triangulate nc st_cast st_cast nc$geometry, geometrycollection don't we also need to carry through the precision as well as the crs of the sfc? the return values are kind of idiomatic and sparse, and there's several places that will require precision re-added as well. or is precision to be explicitly dropped here due to the unwrapping?
