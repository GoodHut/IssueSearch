 URL : "https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-grid/issues/6164" TITLE : expandable unusable state BODY : the expandable grid gets into an unusable state when you expand a bottom row and scroll up. this issue is more pronounced on my local project which has a sub-grid with many rows. it can be reproduced on the ui grid tutorial page by expanding a couple bottom rows: go to expandable grid tutorial page: http://ui-grid.info/docs/ /tutorial/216_expandable_grid scroll to the bottom and expand the last two rows, 498 and 499. start scrolling up. notice that half the rows are now missing and they do not return until scrolling. all the way back down to the bottom. example from the tutorial. updated: link to tutorial was incorrect original was http://ui-grid.info/docs/ /tutorial/306_expandable_grid
