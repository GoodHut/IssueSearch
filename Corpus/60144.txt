BODY : i really love git and i prefer it to source forge. and i see you have update many things since you fork it ... the official project commit nothing from 2017-07-04 we plan to use this game on retropie and configure it for all users with an easy auto-setup. https://github.com/zerojay/retropie-extra/issues/264 i think it is better for us to use your git repo than sf. but : - have you the last official source version ? - have you plan to merge your code with future official updates ? - or maybe this repo is the new official repo ? thanks
