 URL : "https://github.com/wmonk/create-react-app-typescript/issues/211" TITLE : jest ignoring babelrc BODY : i am attempting to use babel-plugin-emotion with a freshly created cra-typescript app. i have successfully injected the plugin into the webpack config using a method similar to the one found here https://gist.github.com/mrlundis/ca809eea890fa9fd5d98facd51cde731 with react-app-rewired so the plugin works fine with build and start , but now my problem is that i cannot get jest to pay attention to the fact that the emotion plugin is listed in .babelrc . i've tried inserting jest->globals->ts-jest->usebabelrc: true in package.json but that hasn't done anything either. i've dug through the source of react-scripts in this repo but i'm having trouble understand what is ultimately responsible for setting up jest, so i'm not sure if this is a concern of create-react-app-typescript or ts-jest or something else entirely, so if someone could point me in the right direction, i'd really appreciate it.
