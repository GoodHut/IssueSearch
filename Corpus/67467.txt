BODY : hey, me again. now i am dead set on using this mod. but like before, i have no idea what i am doing... at all. this isn't exactly an issue. i would like it for some of the code from here: https://github.com/theractivator/from-the-ground-up/wiki/crafttweaker-support to be explained to me. the last issue i had was here: https://github.com/theractivator/from-the-ground-up/issues/26 which involved me trying to add test pages. now i am trying to get more technologies, adding items, adding idea and research recipes, with some scrambles. any help would be awesome. this mod is amazing, just not user friendly to non coders like myself. thanks!
