 URL : "https://github.com/ProtocolSupport/ProtocolSupport/issues/715" TITLE : ground entities issue BODY : it seems that using the newest paperspigot, protocolsupport, waterfall, & protocollib versions and it seems that on 1.11+ anytime a player drops a block on the ground with q, or really any dropped block or item, it is invisible. if the player is on 1.10.2 or lower, it works fine, and the player can see the block or item fine. the plugin combination does not matter, as it happens on my hub, creative, and skyblock server.
