 URL : "https://github.com/stolksdorf/homebrewery/issues/482" TITLE : can't access my brews page BODY : hey there. i have two accounts for the homebrewery. one is my own personal use and one is an account for my d&d group. my first account works perfectly fine but whenever i use the second account i run into an issue. anytime i click on my username, instead of taking me to the my brews page, it takes me to the create a new brew page. i have seen some people say that this issue occurs if you log in with an email but my account on the homebrewery is not an email address. is there anyway i can fix this issue? better yet, since my first account works, is there any way i can just change my password for the first account since i know that one works? additional details share link : or brew code to reproduce : <details><summary>click to expand</summary><code><pre> paste brew code here </pre></code></details>
