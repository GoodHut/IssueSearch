 URL : "https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/3277" TITLE : sanity check option BODY : description of the problem / feature request / question: it would be nice to have a sanity check feature, either on by default or flag enabled, that does a quick check for common case stupid errors. i spend a frustrated hour trying to pick apart a linker error, only to find that i had listed a .h file under both srcs and hdrs. a check that there are no header files under srcs seems simple, and i am sure there are a lot more cases when a few lines of code could save a lot of debugging down the line. if possible, provide a minimal example to reproduce the problem: be me, coding too late to be smart. have you found anything relevant by searching the web? a quick google search did not show any such functionality
