 URL : "https://github.com/firehol/netdata/issues/3049" TITLE : nginx plus plugin? BODY : nginx plugin does not work with nginx plus, would be nice to get at least some of the basic information into netdata that the nginx plugin provides. example of nginx plus dashboard: https://demo.nginx.com/status.html example of json data provided: http://demo.nginx.com/status if this was to be added to netdata, would it be better as a separate plugin or added to the existing nginx plugin?
