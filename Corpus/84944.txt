 URL : "https://github.com/kelsiecleaver/js-linked-list/issues/1" TITLE : dry up new node creations BODY : consider the following: - https://github.com/kelsiecleaver/js-linked-list/blob/master/linkedlist.js l19-l22 - https://github.com/kelsiecleaver/js-linked-list/blob/master/linkedlist.js l25-l28 - https://github.com/kelsiecleaver/js-linked-list/blob/master/linkedlist.js l70-l73 - https://github.com/kelsiecleaver/js-linked-list/blob/master/linkedlist.js l78-l81 notice how the code is setting the head, tail, and a node's next value to be an object literal? that can be dried up with a function that can create and return a node in the place of those object literals. in that case, only one function and area builds the node.
