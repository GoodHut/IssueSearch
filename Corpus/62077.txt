 URL : "https://github.com/arduino-cmake/arduino-cmake/issues/32" TITLE : can't use servo library BODY : using the latest version of arduino-cmake from the master branch, i'm unable to use the servo library that comes with the arduino sdk. this is due to the lack of a defined processor architecture in the case of my code which runs on an uno, arduino_arch_avr . if i manually define this in my cmake file, the project compiles but will not link undefined reference to etc . if i manually add the correct servo source file as a part of my firmware in the cmake file, the project compiles as expected. --- system information arduino sdk 1.8.0 arduino-cmake master branch, 79dc24f linux clion 2017.3, build cl-173.3727.114 compilation.log https://github.com/arduino-cmake/arduino-cmake/files/1544780/compilation.log
