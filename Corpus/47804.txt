 URL : "https://github.com/Gizra/elm-debouncer/issues/1" TITLE : publish version 1.0.0 BODY : the code is basically complete. however, there are several things needed before version 1.0.0. - the api at the moment is complete & very flexible. however, it would be nice to layer some simpler apis on top of it in order to do common things more easily. it would also be possible to expose some alternative methods for integrating the state management i.e. how you call the update function into the client's app. - i should think about the name of the module. there are a lot of debouncing modules, and i wouldn't want to collide with their names. so, it might be a good idea to use a namespace with this one ... for instance, use module gizra.debouncer rather than module debouncer . - we'll need examples, and ideally tests. testing will be a little interesting!
