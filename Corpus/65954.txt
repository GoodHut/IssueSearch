 URL : "https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin/issues/1528" TITLE : logging accepted packet BODY : if i set logging both dropped and accepted packets, factory firmware logs all dropped packets, but accepted packets only if they are arriving from wan. except if i enable ipv6, then all v6 packets are logged, but v4 packets only dropped ones and which are received from wan/ppp0 in merlin firmware all accepted udp, tcp syn packet logged, even if they arriving from lan in=br0 . naturally, i can filter them on syslog server, but i'd like to know if it is a bug or a feature...
