 URL : "https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/issues/456" TITLE : usage with apm BODY : i'm currently developing an atom package and thinking about publishing it with semantic-release . apm's publish command is already quite easy to use http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/publishing/ publish-your-package , but i would like to have travis ci do the publishing for me, so that i can make changes and accept pull requests without having to worry about publishing. does anyone have experience with using semantic-release to publish to apm?
