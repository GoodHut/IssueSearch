 URL : "https://github.com/christinloehner/linuxcounter.new/issues/85" TITLE : certificate is vulnerable BODY : i don't know if this has been raised in the past i suspect it must have been but any certificate can be displayed by anyone if they want to look cool with certificate number 1 for example on their website . since i have just checked the issue raised in 66 there is no way to link the certificate to the profile information, but how about instead putting the first and last name on the certificate graphic if they are entered in the profile. this would obviously have to be an opt-in feature for privacy reasons since a bot could go through and collect all names of registered linux users but would be nice for people who wanted it? gary 103270 :-
