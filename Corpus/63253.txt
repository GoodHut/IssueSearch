 URL : "https://github.com/slamdata/slamdata/issues/1792" TITLE : discovery: card plugins BODY : thanks to new halogen and eval graph architecture if we do something with 1791 we can make cards plugins. to do it we need + make card model untyped or open variant. tagged foreign is the simplest option. + provide card plugin registering mechanic. + extract cards to separate repos. + switch to runtime registering. + make js bindings to purescript-sqlsquare or maybe just a lib with all bindings and an example. same as 1791 i'd like to discuss this during slamfest, but if anyone has thoughts please comment here :
