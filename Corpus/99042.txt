 URL : "https://github.com/ResEnv/chain-api/issues/79" TITLE : maintain site-wide metrics BODY : we should be able to create a continuous query that would aggregate data across the site to get things like site-wide average temperature, humidity, etc. we also might want to calculate site-wide min/max and stdev. from an api standpoint i think we'd link to this data from the site resource. use cases: 1. in the sonification we often re-scale data values relative to the site min/max or mean/std, this way we wouldn't need to keep track of that client-side. open questions: 1. how often do we recalculate this? 2. do we also want time-aggregates for these data streams? in that case do we want all possible combinations of time-aggregate functions and sitewide aggregate functions e.g., do we need to have the daily max of the sitewide min ? i'd be curious what other use cases people would have for this, which would drive the features.
