 URL : "https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack/issues/565" TITLE : add icons to toolbar BODY : i could use one of the many raster or vector icon sets on the web, or design my own. pinging @milholen since this is design-related. requires modifying blendish to support 2x icon sizes. requires adding tooltips and a tooltip overlay so you can see what each icon does. tooltips should be displayed immediately on hover. i don't think we need a way to disable tooltips, since i don't imagine they'd ever be annoying.
