 URL : "https://github.com/firemodels/fds/issues/5149" TITLE : smokeview feature request BODY : hi glenn, i would like to suggest adding some flexibility in viewing in smokeview. one can choose different types of view in the rotation option. however, i can see the moving the whole plan is missing, it can sort of be done with eye centered option, but once one switch to other view , then it will readjust to the default. in blender and other softwares, you can use the shift+ scroll wheel to change the view plan to up down, right left with the flexibility to rotate the view with just using the wheel scroll. now, one can rotate with scene centered: 2 axis, and move the plan to right or left, but not to up and down. to make the long story short: i would like to see if you can make a scene with scene centered: 2 axis and eye centered together. with 2 axis, you can rotate with left button and zoom with the wheel scroll. i would like to see shift+ left button for example make one move the plan to left/right and up/down. if this feature already exists, i would love to know how to use it. cheers, salah
