 URL : "https://github.com/ros-visualization/webkit_dependency/issues/1" TITLE : purpose of this package BODY : i'm curious to the purpose of this package. i just encountered this a a dependency for rqt_web . don't we have rosdep to find the right system dependencies for a given platform + ros distro? why should there be a package which in practise does nothing more than delegate to a rosdep key?
