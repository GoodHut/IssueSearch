 URL : "https://github.com/codeclou/docker-atlassian-jira-data-center/issues/1" TITLE : make persistent containers BODY : i've removed the --rm flag from docker run commands in the script, so that you can make a persistent cluster that then can be started via docker start at a later stage. if you could put a sleep 300 between scaling on create , then you'd not need to --scale 1 on action=create, and cluster nodes would start up gradually. it will still work, but you need to docker stop/start nodes >1 so they sync up with the cluster properly.
