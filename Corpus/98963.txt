 URL : "https://github.com/cooper/adminifier/issues/4" TITLE : login window popup problem BODY : if the adminfiier php session thinks we are still logged in, it provides the session id to the wiki client,, which causes the resume command to be used. the wikiserver immediately drops the connection, before the client has a chance to send the login command. to fix this, there needs to be a way to say if $remote, do not send the session id in the initial authentication.
