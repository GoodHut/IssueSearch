 URL : "https://github.com/tenex/rails-assets/issues/399" TITLE : too many slicks BODY : there are at least three somewhat identical gems that pull in https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick. moreover, one is broken. broken: https://rails-assets.org/ /components/slick.js when you specify slick.js in your javascript assets file, it pulls in a css file. i assume because the css is erroneously named slick.js.css. seems to be working: https://rails-assets.org/ /components/slick-carousel although, slick.js needs to be required after jquery unlike the instructions demonstrate/ untested: https://rails-assets.org/ /components/kenwheeler--slick looks identical to the others.
