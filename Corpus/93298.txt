 URL : "https://github.com/Tertiush/ParadoxIP150/issues/4" TITLE : add payload for arm/disarm BODY : this script is great!but it would improve by adding the payload for the state of arm and disarm making it compatible with other systems eg: home assistant it's possible? v2 does it already .... home assistant exists in a component called mqtt alarm which provides for the control even with the alarm code by sending messages like: paradox / c / p1 /> arm would be great.... thank you
