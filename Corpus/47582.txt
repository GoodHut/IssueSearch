 URL : "https://github.com/akhodakivskiy/VimFx/issues/867" TITLE : port to webextensions BODY : vimperator https://github.com/vimperator/vimperator-labs the leading vim plugin for firefox is undergoing an end-of-life transition as the firefox based xul-type add on support is ending in that browser. there's a discussion at vimperator https://github.com/vimperator/vimperator-labs/issues/705 about porting to the webextension api. since to a large extent the system is compatible with the extension api supported by google chrome and opera. - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/add-ons/webextensions it would seem desirable to unify the existing vim-like addon community into a project using this shared architecture. it also may be the case that chrome inevitably forces its own add ons to conform to the webextension api. regardless, i'm creating this issue to bring attention to the previously mentioned effort. feel free to join the discussion here https://github.com/vimperator/vimperator-labs/issues/705 .
