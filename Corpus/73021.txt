 URL : "https://github.com/awfuchs/cellarduino/issues/8" TITLE : code health cleanup list BODY : here are some things that should be cleaned up: - numsamples does nothing; remove it - factor out alert generation, stop using tempadaptxx flags - factor out duty cycle calculation - factor out raise/lower goal temp - factor out data formatting and output - factor out temperature input - rename adaptemp goaltemp so that the main loop becomes more like: loop { currenttemp = readtemp ; fanstate = setfanstate currenttemp ; dutycycle = getdcstatus fanstate ; adapttemp dutycycle ; logdata currenttemp, fanstate, dutycycle, goaltemp; }
