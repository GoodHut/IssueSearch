 URL : "https://github.com/BiffBangPow/message-board/issues/8" TITLE : add bootstrap and bower BODY : we talked about adding bootstrap to the front end. but this is a third party library so we should use a dependency management tool to install it instead of committing it to the repo. the tool for the job is bower: https://bower.io/ you will have to install bower with npm if you can figure that out let us know if you need admin access to install stuff . you can then create a bower.json file https://github.com/bower/spec/blob/master/json.md in the web directory and add bootstrap to the dependencies section and then we just have to cd web and then run bower install to get the dependencies to a directory bower_components. remember to add the new bower_components directory to your gitignore so that bootstrap doesn't get committed to the repo
