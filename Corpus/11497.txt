BODY : hi there, i really like the idea of pyinstaller and use it in my project activitywatch https://github.com/activitywatch/activitywatch which is getting pretty stable . pyinstaller works good, but sometimes it could work better. i was surprised when i couldn't find a way to donate or fund the project. i was wondering what the main contributors think about donations/funding, would it increase development work? if so, where can i donate? one software solution for managing donated funds is opencollective.com i really like recurring payments and the focus on transparency . not sure if this could really be considered an issue, but i thought this would be the best place to ask. ðŸ’¸ ðŸ’¸ ðŸ’¸
