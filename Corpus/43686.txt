 URL : "https://github.com/kekeh/mydatepicker/issues/268" TITLE : datepicker as popover BODY : hi, is there a way to make the datepicker a popover on top of everything else? currently, opening the datepicker enlarges the enclosing div, thus adding scrollbars and messing up the layout. is it, e.g., possible to add the datepicker to the document body and use it with absolute positioning? regards, j.
