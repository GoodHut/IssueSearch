 URL : "https://github.com/stanford-ppl/spatial-lang/issues/242" TITLE : partial mem reduce BODY : is there already an issue for this? it would be nice to be able to do something like memreduce 0::16, 0::16 , accum n by 1 {i => ... }{_+_} in cases where we try to save area by reusing hardware to do convolutions and the layer dimensions are different, we could use the same large memory but only reduce over a portion of it since we know this portion is all we will care to store into dram.
