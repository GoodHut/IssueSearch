 URL : "https://github.com/TeamAmaze/AmazeFileManager/issues/774" TITLE : ftp connection reset BODY : first of all, thank you for the excellent app! my issue is not so much a bug as it is a question as to how to handle large ftp file transfers. it seems like the probable cause for the reset is the device going to sleep for powersaving when the screen turns off. what is the best way to prevent this from happening? is it possible to add some feature to keep the connection awake until the transfer is completed? i've just been keeping the screen awake so far but it would be nice to be able to ignore it.
