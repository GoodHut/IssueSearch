 URL : "https://github.com/dojo/widgets/issues/296" TITLE : reconsider main.ts BODY : bug it's odd that we don't provide a single css file that contains all component css files, but we do provide a single module that exposes all component modules. it's also weird that the module we provide only exposes top-level components, like tabcontroller, but not necessary enums, like mode from checkbox . this means that even though i can use checkbox from the main module, i still need to explicitly import supporting enums from respective component packages. package version: latest expected behavior: if we make it so main.ts provides all components, supporting components, and enums, we should also provide a main.css again. otherwise we should remove main.ts altogether since it's an anti-pattern. actual behavior: main.ts provides top-level components and no supporting classes or enums, and we don't provide a css file that includes all component css files.
