 URL : "https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/issues/1603" TITLE : integration with apollo BODY : hi!, i am working integrating react-select with redux-form and apollo-client , so far the integration with redux-form is seamless, but my use case here being that when the user types something in the input, i will be grabbing data dynamically performing graphql calls through apollo. this leads me to two options. - make use of oninputchange and trigger a new query, and pass the new options as props. however when i do this, the current input value gets reseted - use select.async and the loadoptions props. however, how apollo client works is that i trigger a new query and then i receive the new data when it's available via props, so there seems to be no easy solution to call the callback back with the new data, as i don't have access to the request itself, right?. any ideas how / if this could be accomplished?
