 URL : "https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/issues/736" TITLE : clarify acks of acks BODY : currently section 9 says > to avoid creating an indefinite feedback loop, an endpoint must not generate an ack frame in response to a packet containing only ack or padding frames. there is some implementation confusion around it. consensus seems to be that this means the packet containing only ack/padding does end up referenced in an ack frame eventually, but the generation of the ack frame should not be triggered by the receipt of the ack/padding-only packet. however an alternative explanation, don't include the packet number of the ack/padding-only packet in any ack frame, is possible. it would be good to be clear. i've noticed that the phrases like don't ack acks contribute to the confusion. is it true that every packet except vn and stateless-retry needs to eventually be acknowledged? if so - that might be a useful clarifier.
