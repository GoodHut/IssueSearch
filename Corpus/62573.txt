 URL : "https://github.com/vagnerclementino/guava/issues/65" TITLE : consider using appveyor BODY : as is currently done in google-java-format https://github.com/google/google-java-format , i think it's worth testing guava against windows using appveyor, or at least i think it's worth for the guava team to consider looking into it. currently, guava makes no guarantees that it will run successfully on windows, as explained in the readme: > important warnings > ... > 5, we unit-test and benchmark the libraries using only openjdk 1.7 on linux. some features, especially in com.google.common.io , may not work correctly in other environments. i do understand that there would need to be a number of changes or improvements before guava can build successfully on windows https://github.com/google/guava/issues/2130 , so i suspect this would be a long-term thing to tackle.
