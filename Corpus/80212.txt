 URL : "https://github.com/dib-lab/osf-cli/issues/68" TITLE : tests still fail locally BODY : after our discussion today @betatim: somehow running py.test still fails for me when running it locally, even when there's no .osfcli.config present in the osf-cli folder. i tried a fresh clone of this repo and it gives 6 failed, 60 passed in 1.76 seconds and in all 6 cases the error is the following: attributeerror: <module 'osfclient.cli' from 'â€¦/osf-cli/osfclient/cli.py'> does not have the attribute 'open' i've tested on python 3.4.4 and python 2.7.12 .
