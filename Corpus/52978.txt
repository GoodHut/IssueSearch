 URL : "https://github.com/ceri-comps/ceri-icon/issues/8" TITLE : custom iconset support BODY : i wonder if it's possible to load an icon or iconset from some directory inside the project folder. use case: in readme you wrote > if you need other free icon sets, let me know.. but i would like very much like to be able to work with custom icons. for example, the logo of my project or other infographic that i do not have the opportunity to publicate.
