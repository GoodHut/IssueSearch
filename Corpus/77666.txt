 URL : "https://github.com/unosquare/embedio/issues/63" TITLE : not able to set nulllog! BODY : i did install from nuget 1.4.6 . in this binary, there's no way to set nulllog as ilog in webserver constructor. looking at the source code, you're using conditional tag for compilation. is there any reason for that? is it safe just download all source code and set compat in conditional compilation symbols at build properties?
