 URL : "https://github.com/filipw/dotnet-script/issues/101" TITLE : readme.md needs updated BODY : with the latest version, the readme.md is outdated. need to talk about how to install via the zip package i'd like to see package manager support, such as chocolatey on windows and apt-get or other managers on other platforms . also need to remove the project.json stuff and show the code using the new r directives. csharp r nuget:automapper,5.1.1 r nuget:newtonsoft.json,9.0.1 using newtonsoft.json; using automapper; console.writeline hello! ; var test = new { hi = i'm json! }; console.writeline jsonconvert.serializeobject test ; console.writeline typeof mapperconfiguration ; just some feedback... this is a huge step forward, and now it's truly a scripting language. the only downside here is in the performance. the startup time when trying to run the above code is quite significant. still, this is an awesome way to experiment with c code.
