 URL : "https://github.com/AlexRudd/key-manager/issues/8" TITLE : lack of newline BODY : i have two groups with access to a given node. i had to add a blank line to the end of the 'first' groups authorized_keys file in order for the 2nd file to work only had one key . i suspect something about the newline is confusing sshd such that it skips that key. it would probably be safer to ensure that a full newline is added after the end of each file before it is emitted to sshd.
