 URL : "https://github.com/RobertMyles/tidyRSS/issues/7" TITLE : problem reading feeds BODY : hi, i have used this package before and it worked for some feeds. i say some because feeds are finicky. however, the package suddenly stopped working. for example, i cannot get access to feeds such as https://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/press_orders.xml, https://public.govdelivery.com/topics/usfdic_11/feed.rss, or https://www.sec.gov/rss/investor/alerts. the code i use is very simple: library tidyrss tidyfeed https://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/press_all.xml , result = all and here is the error i receive: error in withcallinghandlers expr, warning = function w invokerestart mufflewarning : this page does not appear to be a suitable feed. have you checked that you entered the url correctly? if you are certain that this is a valid rss feed, please file an issue at: https://github.com/robertmyles/tidyrss/issues. please note that the feed may also be undergoing maintenance. the site is not down since i can access the feed from python or using other r packages. i would appreciate if you can look into this. thank you!
