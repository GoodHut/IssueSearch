 URL : "https://github.com/ethcore/parity/issues/4591" TITLE : plan for ipc revival BODY : - seamless ipc-codegen: - remove binaryencodable trait and derive - write serde::serializer and serde::deserializer implementations in parity_ipc crate. - codegen in-place: no more include! : kill all types modules. - explicitly fail on trait inheritance. - modularization: - allow multiple ipc communication channels over a single socket - make a distinction between stable ipc traits and internal utility traits. ...will add more to this list as they're thought of. other concerns: - integration with futures-rs instead of blocking on every call? - non-awful error messages in codegen?
