 URL : "https://github.com/killercup/waltz/issues/9" TITLE : add run mode BODY : the idea is waltz through a guide, and act like a human reader would: copypasta some code into files, and run shell commands. syntax annotate a code block like this sh,run=bash cd foo cargo run --example foo-bar waltz run 1. for each code block 1. write code block to file/append content to file 2. if the mode is run , execute the file with the set command implementation steps, and feature ideas - parse run=<cmd> - allow omitting file name when run is set generate random file name with extenstion based on code block lang - default <cmd> based on code block language sh = sh foo.sh , bash = bash foo.sh , rust = rustc -o foo foo.rs && ./foo , etc. - cleverly assert command's exit code, e.g. by setting set -e in shell scripts
