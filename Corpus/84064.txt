 URL : "https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/194" TITLE : core render config errors BODY : report.configerrors https://github.com/pmd/pmd/blob/5b3142433bcfd037ac3a15c2e704f701b93c3cac/pmd-core/src/main/java/net/sourceforge/pmd/report.java l428 stores configuration errors for rules, but those are not used in any renderer. we should start rendering these, exposing all errors to the user. this feature would be a good place to start registering missing classes during analysis, as discussed here https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/171 issuecomment-270433150
