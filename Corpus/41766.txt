 URL : "https://github.com/cloudflare/bn256/issues/1" TITLE : add hashing to g1/g2? BODY : hi! the official implementation lacks hashing to g1/g2 which is vital for some applications like implementation of the pythia prf service https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/644.pdf http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ace/papers/pythia-talk.pdf and short signatures. i know there exist implementations and docs for those: https://www.di.ens.fr/~fouque/pub/latincrypt12.pdf https://github.com/ace0/relic/blob/master/src/ep/relic_ep_map.c l39 c, g1 https://github.com/ace0/relic/blob/master/src/epx/relic_ep2_map.c l163 c, g2 https://github.com/randombit/pairings.py/blob/master/bn256.py l1076 python it would be so helpful if you implemented it along with your optimizations. thanks in advance
