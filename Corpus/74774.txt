 URL : "https://github.com/certego/fw1-loggrabber/issues/32" TITLE : filter for ! not working BODY : i am trying to filter out any connection that contains action=accept... basically i don't want to pull any logs that are accepted. when i change the filter to action!=accept , it still pulls all actions including accept. the only way i've been able to get this working slightly is to specify action=deny,drop,prevent anybody else have this issue?
