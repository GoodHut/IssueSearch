 URL : "https://github.com/egoist/poi/issues/290" TITLE : hot-reload template file BODY : <!-- please don't delete this template or we'll close your issue --> <!-- before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of poi. --> do you want to request a feature or report a bug ? feature <!-- issues which contain questions or support requests will be closed. --> what is the current behavior? i would like to use poi for a basic one-pager that is mostly html and a little javascript. so i added my own html template configuration in poi.config.js : module.exports = { html: { template: 'index.html', } } when i change anything in index.js , the changes are hot-reloaded in the browser. however, when i change something in index.html it does not reload. the change is detected see log from the browser below , but the changes are not reloaded. wds app updated. recompiling... wds app hot update... hmr checking for updates on the server... hmr nothing hot updated. hmr app is up to date. when i change something in poi.config.js , it appears that poi reloads the whole application. maybe this behaviour could be added for template files as well. if the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce. <!-- a great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a github gist. --> <!-- best provide a minimal reproducible repo --> what is the expected behavior? changes in the template should cause a reload in the browser with the changes. if this is a feature request, what is the motivation or use case for changing the behavior? this would be interesting for pages where you want to add mostly html e.g. because of seo reasons and just a little javascript. please mention other relevant information such as the browser version, node.js version, poi version and operating system.
