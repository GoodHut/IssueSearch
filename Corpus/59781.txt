 URL : "https://github.com/barche/QML.jl/issues/34" TITLE : use of qml in a module BODY : startup time for my code is quite long, so i want to try to pack it all into a module and use __precompile__ . somehow qml didn't recognize the functions used in julia which are exposed to qml through @qmlfunction . neither if i export the function or call it with julia.nuclidevector.decay_gui from qml still @qmlfunction decay_gui of julia side . it always results in typeerror: cannot call method 'decay_gui' of undefined . is it even reasonable and possible to precompile a package with the use of qml?
