 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/1342" TITLE : run go tools from docker BODY : go tools rocks, we all know about it, but there is a problem that is happening very often with me. the linters running at the ci and the ones running on my machine are different because they were installed in different moments. to solve the ci problem, did a docker image with the linter already installed, so, i never get surprises about the linter rules changing. but, the problem on development machine remains, sometimes the linter warn but the ci don't and the opposite too, which is very frustrating. would be great if we could add any kind of command on the configuration. the vscode-go, could recognize the default ones gometalinter, golint and megacheck , but if the user put another one, it could respect. json { go.linttool : docker start --name linter -v ${workspaceroot}/project } or something like this: json { go.lintplatform : docker , go.linttool : gometalinter , } with go.lintplatform the vscode-go could call the docker passing the gometalinter as a param.
