 URL : "https://github.com/giginet/xcprofiler/issues/27" TITLE : support for build logs BODY : this is rather a feature request. when the body function analysis is turned on, the profiling data also shows up in xcodebuild logs, which is captured by tools like scan and gym as well. so the request is to add support for parsing build logs, e.g. xcprofiler myapp.log . would that be possible?
