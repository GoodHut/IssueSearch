 URL : "https://github.com/stephenplusplus/grunt-wiredep/issues/164" TITLE : target specific overrides BODY : is there a way i can specify overrides for a specific target? for instance i use a framework that has angular embedded into a libs file, but when i run tests in my grunt file it's having issues with other bower components not being able to access that embedded version of angular . it would be nice if when i'm running the grunt file for the test target it would be able to read the overrides specific for the test target and instead of including their libs file, include the libraries independently just for tests. is this at all possible?
