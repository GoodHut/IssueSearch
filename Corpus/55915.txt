 URL : "https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/issues/6099" TITLE : lua enums and @:expose BODY : i use enums quite a lot and according to documentation i should use @:expose if i want to expose this enum to be accessible outside of the generated code scope: @:expose enum color{ red; green; blue; yellow; in generated code enum is not exposed. this is problematic, so i have to do workarounds and expose them using: static function __init__ { untyped __lua__ '_hx_exports enums color = enums.color' ; }
