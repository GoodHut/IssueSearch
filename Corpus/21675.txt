 URL : "https://github.com/1up-lab/OneupUploaderBundle/issues/305" TITLE : gaufrette + aws s3 BODY : hey here, i don't know if it's an issue since i don't find anyone complaining about that but i realized that when i upload a file with oneupuploaderbundle to amazon the file is uploaded two times and so the upload time is twice as big. even the progress event is doing 0-100 during the first upload my guess is that it's doing, user to server and then it does not get call anymore during the second upload server to amazon i don't know if it's a normal behavior, else i'd like to know how i could manage this differently
