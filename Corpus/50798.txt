 URL : "https://github.com/TechnionYP5777/Smartcity-Smarthouse/issues/186" TITLE : add aliases to sensors BODY : sensors will have a new alias field that is defined from the sensor itself and is sent to the system . the aliases will help the user distinguish between different sensors with the same commercial name. for example if mom and dad both have vitals sensor, we will be able to distinguish between them. this is regarding a comment from @adiomari about the system's ability to handle to sensors of the same kind.
