 URL : "https://github.com/benwbrum/fromthepage/issues/623" TITLE : invite to transcribe BODY : we need a way for work/collection owners to enter in a list of email addresses and invite their crowd to transcribe the project. need a good template email, which they could modify, that includes a link directly to the work/collection. if we wanted to get fancy we could track which invitations were accepted and turned into users/transcribers. i wonder if there is a gem for this? https://github.com/tomichj/invitation might work, but we'd need to think through user permissions as well.
