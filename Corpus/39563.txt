 URL : "https://github.com/OzzyCzech/Simple-Time-Track/issues/10" TITLE : single timer at once BODY : hello roman, you have created the simple time track add-in for chrome. works easy, but i am missing something .. is it easy to create the behavior that it works like a chess clock? if you switch one clock on, another clock that ran, stops automatically. in my case this makes more sense, because i can only do one task at the time. ;o i am not a multi tasking person ... hope to hear from you. kind regards, harry van der meulen
