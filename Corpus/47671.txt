 URL : "https://github.com/vertcoin/electrum-vtc/issues/58" TITLE : probable synching bug BODY : windows. due to the time required to do a full synch, i shut down the client by normal means. at that point it was a little over halfways synchronized. on next startup, it connected to some servers, pulled some data, churned cpu a bit, and removed one server from the auto-discovered list. this it repeated until the list was empty, then it repopulated the list and started over. never did the local height budge it was stuck at ~466k , nor did it write anything at all to disk. this was clearly an error condition, but i could not find neither required debug logs nor options to turn on debug logging to see exactly what had failed this could be considered a feature request . my suspicion is blockchain_headers might have been left in an unexpected state, that is not handled when synching should resume. i currently consider this a data-loss bug i.e. major . i have saved the blockchain_headers file a little over 35mb , in case it could help research the issue.
