 URL : "https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server/issues/3451" TITLE : duplicate user sessions BODY : describe your issue in as much detail as possible. hi, i'm using the ios sdk. i have a simple login screen with one username textfield, one password textfield and one login button. so far, when i tap the button, the user gets logged in with no difficulty. the only thing i find weird is if the user taps the login button again, a new session is created for each tap. so far, i'm just testing things, so the login view controller doesn't disappear, therefore the user is free to tap the login button time and time again . all the session objects related to the same user have the same installationid and i thought that the previous sessions would be destroyed. is this normal behavior ? how could i disable the previous sessions upon logging in if those sessions have the same userid / installationid pair ? steps to reproduce please include a detailed list of steps that reproduce the issue. include curl commands when applicable. 1. create login view controller in xcode and add ui elements to send username and password to the server 2. tap button to log in multiple times 3. wait for logins to be completed with success expected results one session object with the latest userid/installationid would exist in the database actual outcome a new session object is created every time with no limit. environment setup - server - parse-server version : 2.3.2 - operating system: macos el capitan - hardware: 16gb ram - localhost or remote server? localhost - database - mongodb version: 3.0.6 - storage engine: mmapv1 - hardware: 16gb ram - localhost or remote server? localhost
