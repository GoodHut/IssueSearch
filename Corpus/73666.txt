 URL : "https://github.com/PhilippC/keepass2android/issues/176" TITLE : database backup function BODY : not really an issue but more of a feature request/suggestion. for historical reasons and as a risk management strategy, it would be good if the app could create a historical backup database file on the cloud storage drive of choice eg. google drive, dropbox, etc... . this serves a few benefits: 1. a close backup of passwords in case the primary password database is corrupted. depending on how the backup file is created and backed up, it may also help against ransonware. 2. keeps a record of the previous passwords that we're changed, in case something goes the wrong during password changes on a login system.
