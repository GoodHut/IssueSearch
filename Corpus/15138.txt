 URL : "https://github.com/vanlepthien/Canvas/issues/1" TITLE : create draw queue BODY : current draw mechanism cycles through defined elements and checks to see if the element is within a defined duration, or has been flagged as show . a more robust mechanism would be to have draw run against a list of elements to be drawn or erased from a canvas. partial motivation for this is the need for maintaining state when a transient fixed element is displayed. it would be simpler to enqueue a draw command when the element is first drawn and a remove command when it is to be removed.
