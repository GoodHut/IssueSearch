BODY : first, i try this probiem. $packer->addbox new testbox 'container 20 x 12 x 10 ', 20, 12, 10, 0, 20, 12, 10, 2500 ; $packer->additem new testitem 'b 12 x 12 x 5 ', 12, 12, 5, 8, false ,2 ; $packer->additem new testitem 'c 8 x 12 x 5 ', 8, 12, 5, 8, false ,2 ; normally, it will really fit 100% but this project told it need to fit in 2 boxes. by last item c can't pack in it. it doesn't make sense. so i dig in to your code. and i saw that in $this->logger->debug no more fit in lengthwise, resetting for new row ; $this->lengthleft += $layerlength; $this->widthleft -= $layerwidth; $layerwidth = $layerlength = 0; $this->items->insert $itemtopack ; continue; this is what i think it will explain to you. https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/24362057/24329031/7d3bcd0a-1224-11e7-996a-d847b92415ff.jpg your project is very cool, i really like how you implement your code. and i'm so sorry about annoy you, i would like to you to know that i include your project to my bachelor degree final project. so i need to know every single line of code that i use to explain for my professor :p. sorry for my english.
