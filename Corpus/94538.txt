 URL : "https://github.com/adventistchurch/alps-wordpress/issues/119" TITLE : carousel slide title issue BODY : i have a situation where the size of the title font is far too large for the text i need in there. i can work around it by simply using the subtitle and description boxes, but none of them show up if i don't have anything in title. so i'm guessing it was written with the block being conditional upon having something in the title area. i added a space to get around that, but then the background color shows as a little blip. if the conditionals could be set for each individual field instead of just the title, that would make things a tad bit more flexible.
