 URL : "https://github.com/klokantech/flask-mailgun/issues/3" TITLE : make available on pypi BODY : it would be good to make this project available on pypi. in my opinion, it's the most current and the most complete flask-mailgun implementation available at the moment. i see that https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flask-mailgun is taken by https://github.com/sleekslush/flask-mailgun . i suggest that a request be made to switch that pypi package to instead point to https://github.com/klokantech/flask-mailgun . this will require liaising with @sleekslush and with the pypi admins. @keosak would you be interested in making this happen?
