 URL : "https://github.com/gigabit101/QuantumStorage/issues/123" TITLE : qsu duplication bug BODY : so, i was setting up some botania automation, and i used the extra utilities 2 mechanical user to place blocks. i just finished, and was placing down some qsu's to store the output. but when i placed one, it got turned around, and when i broke it, it dropped two qsu's. i placed it multiple times to see if it was a one-off bug, but it did it every time. i placed the qsu elsewhere, and it placed and broke just like anything else would. this occured on the 1.10 version of your mod, on singleplayer.
