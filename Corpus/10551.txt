 URL : "https://github.com/Hypertopic/Porphyry/issues/47" TITLE : comments an item BODY : with discussion threads, links to sources, and maybe uploaded documents. while a bit too much post-modern for science, comments could be liked by peers. comments could also be shared optionally on social networks to get visibility on one's work. this would also benefit the platform by dragging in additional contributors. as an example of apis that could be developed or integrated, here are: - facebook's social plugin https://developers.facebook.com/products/social-plugins/comments/ , - disqus comment plugin https://disqus.com .
