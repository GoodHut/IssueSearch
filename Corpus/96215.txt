 URL : "https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble/issues/328" TITLE : enhanced exception message BODY : because it was a time when you could write setcommand c , tests/all and the compiler understood that the file tests/all.nim was referred, and that's no more the case, we need to get explicit error messages when nimble raises an exception if it can't find a file. this change is minor and is not worth attaching a patch file or a pull request. in the nimble/src/nimble.nim source file, in proc execbackend options: options = around line 646, change if not fileexists bin : raise newexception nimbleerror, specified file does not exist. for if not fileexists bin : raise newexception nimbleerror, specified file $1 does not exist. % bin there are a few other places where error messages could be made more explicit too.
