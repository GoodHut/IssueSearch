 URL : "https://github.com/jonathanio/update-systemd-resolved/issues/41" TITLE : add common file BODY : would you consider adding a file containing the extra config needed? script-security 2 setenv path /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin up /etc/openvpn/scripts/update-systemd-resolved down /etc/openvpn/scripts/update-systemd-resolved down-pre so that when installing the arch aur package, instead of needing to change any .conf files or add all those separate config parameters to the openvpn command, we could just add --config ../scripts/common.conf assuming the file is in /etc/openvpn/scripts/common.conf to the end of the execstart line in /usr/lib/systemd/system/openvpn-client@.service and it would work. that way the file would be kept up-to-date here. or is this something i need to ask to the aur package maintainer?
