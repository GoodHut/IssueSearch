 URL : "https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle/issues/11" TITLE : idea spa mode BODY : razzle could turn on/off webpack compilation tasks depending on entry points by convention. this would effectively mean razzle could have mutilple modes of operation: - spa - universal - server-only. _more specifically, imagine..._ ðŸ¤” ðŸ¤” ðŸ¤” ðŸ¤” - if a user makes just a src/index.js , razzle could function like create-react-app in spa mode , only running webpack-dev-server under the hood. - if there is both a src/index.js and a server/index.js , razzle will run in universal mode this is what it does now , running two simultaneous webpack compilers. - if there is _just_ a server/index.js , razzle run in server-only mode, and just use one webpack compiler for the server this is what backpack my other project does now btw . pros: - razzle can grow with your project. that is, users would not need to change build systems or eject when they want to add server rendering. just some code. this is huge. one of the scary parts of cra is that you kind of always have this voice in the back of your head saying one day, you are going to have to eject. - we could easily make spa mode 100% compatible with cra. perhaps even write a migration script as a cli task kind of like how react-storybook's get-storybook modifies cra and nytimes/kyt . cons: - more of conventions - could make configuring entry points more difficult and complex
