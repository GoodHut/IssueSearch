 URL : "https://github.com/mgruner/p5-pod-projectdocs/issues/4" TITLE : set link destination BODY : links to local modules l<local::module> do not resolve to the local documentation. it would be lovely if they could, and if the module is not local to default to using _pod::simple::xhtml_'s default _perldoc_url_prefix_ value. it would also be nice to be able to set the _perldoc_url_prefix_ value. thanks very much for this module - apart from this gripe it just works for me.
