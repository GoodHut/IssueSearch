 URL : "https://github.com/atlasphp/Atlas.Orm/issues/47" TITLE : require php 7 ? BODY : open discussion topic. i am preparing another release alpha release of atlas. currently it requires php 5.6, and the next alpha will continue with that requirement. however, for the next release after that whether alpha or beta , i think upgrading the requirement to php 7 will provide some advantages. typehinting parameters and returns alone will be great. does anyone using atlas have arguments against this?
