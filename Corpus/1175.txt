 URL : "https://github.com/githubschool/on-demand-github-pages/issues/1511" TITLE : i need help BODY : describe what you need help with here. i am confused between the make local changes github desktop page and the add local commits with github desktop page. i opted for the github themed page and followed instructions, greeted the world, on the 'readme' file on the 'add-index-page' page then committed to 'master directory'? is this right? i'm not sure what i'm supposed to do with the local github which i can open when i click on the octopus icon docked at the foot of my screen . i can't see in the video how the html editor was opened, or whether i'm even supposed to open it. have i made changes to my local repository?
