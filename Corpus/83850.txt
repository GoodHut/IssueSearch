 URL : "https://github.com/nolanlawson/cordova-plugin-sqlite-2/issues/48" TITLE : command not defined error BODY : i've upgraded from the old cordova-plugin-sqlite to this version. my code opens a database and i can see it when i inspect through the safari debugger. however, any attempt to execute a transaction ends with a command not defined error. it's not always caught in the debugger - i see it intermittently. i've tried removing the plugin and platform, but this is still a problem. any thoughts on how to fix this?
