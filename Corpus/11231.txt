 URL : "https://github.com/inorichi/tachiyomi/issues/899" TITLE : follow up on 862 BODY : this is a follow up from 862 862 since i have more less better understanding of the real issue this page list empty nag oftenly occur when you have an unstable connection, so what i think happened in the app is that when you're loading the chapter for the 1st time and it returns negative= page list empty even though the chapter itself is there, and it will keep giving you a page list empty even though your connection got better because you failed to load it the 1st time until the library fetch new info. some of the quick fix i used to counter this issue so far is : -when you cant read a ch strangely enough you can just download that 1 ch you cannot view -or use another version of the app which havent failed loading the ch ie: dev build, or using a dual apps feature version: v0.6.1
