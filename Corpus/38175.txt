 URL : "https://github.com/StokeLtd/OneBudgetRequirements/issues/1" TITLE : nynab feature parity BODY : the initial release will strive to reach feature parity with nynab with one exception: automatic imports. at least initially, there is too much maintenance needed to attempt an implementation of that feature. i will not permanently rule it out, though. this will also initially be a web app only although it will be designed to scale down for mobile devices . native apps will be considered after initial release.
