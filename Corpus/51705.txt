 URL : "https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/507" TITLE : baseuri for all fetchs BODY : hello! i will be glad if you could give me a hint about baseurl for fetch . please, check this comment https://github.com/m3co/pseudoimport-html/issues/64 issuecomment-286077396 the rough idea around this question is: may i have a way to setup a baseurl for all fetchs? consider the case when an script contains a lot of fetch calls with relative paths. and i'd like to reuse this script without changing the existing code by adding new url 'relative_path', document.baseuri .tostring to each fetch call. what about if try something like fetch.baseuri = //base-url ; ?
