 URL : "https://github.com/destruc7i0n/shulker/issues/18" TITLE : more detail in the wiki BODY : would it be possible to have more detail added to the wiki? i'm trying to install shulker bot, and have managed to get it working one way discord -> mc , but not the reverse. with reference to the tail command, the wiki says make sure to replace your url and your log directory location , but what exactly is the url? where should it point to? should this be a discordapp url, or something on localhost? apologies if i'm missing something obvious, but i've been trying all sorts for the past few days and haven't been able to work out how it is supposed to be configured.
