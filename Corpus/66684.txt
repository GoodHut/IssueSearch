 URL : "https://github.com/Shadowss/TravianZ/issues/330" TITLE : new expansion mechanics BODY : adjust expansion mechanics, so a player can build chieftain + settlers in the village before they decide which one to use. only allow conquering villages if there are available slots works now and also founding new villages when there are slots for them in the palace or residence there is no check for this now . since this way, we can end up with an unusable chieftain or settlers, allow for chieftain's growth in rank similar to how units can grow into more powerful units in 319 and movement of a chieftain + settlers between villages just like moving a hero works now - via reinforcements .
