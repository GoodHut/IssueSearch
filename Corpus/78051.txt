 URL : "https://github.com/srophe/e-gedsh-app/issues/25" TITLE : patriarch list, maronite BODY : @wsalesky i noticed i was getting odd results when i would click on the link to the subsection of the patriarch list for the maronite church. it turns out that the uri i had assigned to that div type=subsection was the same as the uri for the entry on the maronite church. i changed the uri in the patriarch list but now the link in browse just takes users to the entry on the maronite church. here's the commit: https://github.com/srophe/e-gedsh/commit/a1852149d07e7dd699b64f7b38751478ab27a3ce. thanks.
