 URL : "https://github.com/codeforamerica/jail-dash/issues/38" TITLE : modification adjudication BODY : original question cfa : the sample data we have shows around 200 courts and 400 judges, which makes the charts on this page impractical to render in a compact way. options include making the graphs taller to legibly show every single court and judge this could make the page very long or showing only a subset of courts and judges. what would be the most useful to you? answer slco : please separate out each of the slco district courts, and then separate the two district courts into west jordan district court and salt lake district court.
