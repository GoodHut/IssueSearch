 URL : "https://github.com/aurelia/framework/issues/839" TITLE : looking for collaboration BODY : hi! over at storybook https://github.com/storybooks/storybook website https://storybook.js.org , we've just received an issue / feature-request from @miguelzakharia : https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/issues/2226 i'm looking for people with aurelia knowledge to make this a reality, maybe not today or tomorrow, but in the near future. > storybook is a ui development environment for your ui components. with it, you can visualize different states of your ui components and develop them interactively. > > storybook runs outside of your app. so you can develop ui components in isolation without worrying about app specific dependencies and requirements. are there aurelia contributors reading this interested in co-creating storybook for aurelia? link to our slack: https://now-examples-slackin-nqnzoygycp.now.sh/ i've read the issue template, feel free to close, i'm just looking to open a dialog
