 URL : "https://github.com/fshost/node-dir/issues/51" TITLE : node.js v4 support BODY : hi! in the latest release published '0.1.17': '2017-05-30t11:07:09.749z' it seems to have broken compatibility with node.js 4.x. the module make use of buffer.from , but this is not supported in node.js v4. would you be open to making a new patch release of 0.1.18 that removes reliance on buffer.from , or perhaps is simply 0.1.16 code again? after this then publish a 1.0.0 ? the reason i suggest this is because copy-webpack-plugin relies on this module as a ^ dependency, so even if you release 0.2.0 with buffer.from it will still potentially break many people making builds with node.js 4.x. in a 1.0.0 it would make sense to set engines in package.json to >=5.x.
