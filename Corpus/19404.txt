 URL : "https://github.com/CodeGrade/bottlenose/issues/89" TITLE : add a rubricgrader BODY : other grading platforms allow professors to provide a grading rubric to their staff. this amounts to just the rubric sections of our existing question or codereview assignments, without the actual student-response part. entering these rubrics would be relatively easy: it would reuse the same ui as the codereview grading without student responses, but with student code on the left and questions on the right . as an additional challenge, professors might want to use rubric-based graders and show students three levels of detail: merely the question prompt, prompt plus rubric presets descriptions, or prompt plus rubric presets plus their values.
