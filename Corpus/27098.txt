 URL : "https://github.com/hyperoslo/Compass/issues/54" TITLE : compass 6.0 roadmap BODY : we will convert compass to be in swift 4 soon. this is not really big changes, but we can take this advantage to do some refactoring. some are breaking changes. my proposals are - refactor navigator to be used as instance. and inject scheme and router into it. an app usually does not need many navigator , and use can just set it as the current one. swift let navigator = navigator scheme: compass , routers: routers navigator.current = navigator - right now navigator and router seem to confuse users, the above make the composition clear navigator -> router -> routable - refactor router to be more flexible. not all routers depend on currentcontroller , some like prelogin prefers to switch rootviewcontroller - remove errorroutable , as we can handle via try catch with navigate function
