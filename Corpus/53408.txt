 URL : "https://github.com/fiatjaf/jq-web/issues/2" TITLE : doesn't run on node.js BODY : due to a totally unexpected issue with process.platform being reported as nonexistent in the instantiation of emscripten's nodefs, an error is thrown when jq-web is run on node.js. i imagine that an easy solution already tried by me with manual compiled code editing would be to not instantiate nodefs in any way, but perhaps fixing the process.platform would be better. i'm asking for help on this topic at https://groups.google.com/forum/ !topic/emscripten-discuss/ikl3qxpofak if anyone seeing this has any solution or clue to a solution it will be highly appreciated.
