 URL : "https://github.com/matthiasmullie/minify/issues/184" TITLE : too much minification on BODY : note, this is the same as https://github.com/matthiasmullie/minify/issues/183 the problem the user reported, is not about failed minification... so it's not relevant to increase the pcre.backtrack_limit & pcre.recursion_limit what the user is saying exactly, is that: .mce-container ,.mce-widget becomes: .mce-container ,.mce-widget which will cause the style to be ignored on several browsers. on my specific case, i'm minifying a css file from a popular image gallery, namelly this file: http://8147-presscdn-0-3.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/plugins/soliloquy/assets/css/soliloquy.css what happens here, is that the file is minified and there is no error. i can see that it was minified completely... however, like the issue on 183, what happens here is that .soliloquy-container, .soliloquy-container { becomes: .soliloquy-container,.soliloquy-container { and the lack of space before will cause the styling to break. likewise, further down: background: transparent url images/preloader.gif no-repeat scroll 50% 50%; becomes: background: transparent url images/preloader.gif no-repeat scroll 50%50%; while i haven't specifically tested this one, it also seems to break the design on the page. kindly preserve the space before and after so design won't be broken. thanks.
