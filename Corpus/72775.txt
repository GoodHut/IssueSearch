 URL : "https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk/issues/606" TITLE : change connect_ to fnmut BODY : i have the following piece of code rust let mut draw_pass = 0; draw_area.connect_draw move |_self, ctx| { // ... draw_pass += 1; // whatever } but that's throwing an error: cannot assign to captured outer variable in an fn closure . from what i could gather this shouldn't happen if the closure i pass into connect_draw were a fnmut which is why i'm opening this ticket ðŸ˜‰ not sure if there is a more elegant way of doing this. if so, please let me know
