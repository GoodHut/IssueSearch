 URL : "https://github.com/JonathanxD/KWCommands/issues/6" TITLE : support dynamic arguments BODY : currently, arguments are static, meaning that argument does not change based on other values provided to command, this also add support for list arguments without the needed of comma. list argument the evaluation of argument will be simple, when a list<element> argument is found, consecutive inputs will be parsed until the validator of element returns false , example: example 1 2 hello 3 fun example values: list<int>, str: string { //... } the value of values will be a list of 1 and 2 , the value of str will be hello . but the string will fail to be parsed, because there is no command registered with name 3 . dynamic argument an argument where, validator , transformer and possibilitiesfunc receives parsed arguments, allowing dynamic validation, transformation and possibilities, so you will be able to create an argument whose input values are only the multiple of the last parsed value: fun example values: list<int> { ... } input example 3 6 12 48 is valid, because 6 is multiple of 3, 12 is multiple of 6, 48 is multiple of 12, but example 3 6 12 48 56 is not a valid input, because 56 is not a multiple of 48.
