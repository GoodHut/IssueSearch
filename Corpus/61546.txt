 URL : "https://github.com/abernatskiy/epdm/issues/5" TITLE : bad random seed default BODY : the default behavior of the library is to use some flavor of time as a random seed. whatever that value is, it doesn't change frequently enough to produce diverse trajectories for shorter simulations. due to widespread malign practice of not controlling random seeds explicitly, this will pose a problem for the users. either make a default sensible or remove the default behavior altogether.
