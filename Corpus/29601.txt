 URL : "https://github.com/jazz-community/jazz-plugin-base-service/issues/3" TITLE : maven install fails BODY : running mvn install in the repository folder results in a load of errors. it's possible that these errors are caused by my environment and not the package itself. but since i followed all the instructions in the readme and have tried for a while to solve this without success, i'm posting it here anyway. i'm running from windows 10 x64 with the java 9.0.1 jdk installed. i've attached a file with the output that i get from running mvn install log.txt https://github.com/jazz-community/jazz-plugin-base-service/files/1540790/log.txt is there anything else that i need to configure or install? do you need any additional information from me? i'm a bit stuck here so thanks in advance for any help.
