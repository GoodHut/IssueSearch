BODY : @nhenriksen - we were trying to work with the cyclopentanol guest 4 example from cd set 1, and noticed that the amber prmtop file has mixed 1-4 scaling factors scee . was this intended and, if so, can you explain why? this makes conversion into some code bases gromacs for example impossible, and i've also never seen it before, so i am very curious where this came from/why it's done here. thanks. cc @elkhoury
