 URL : "https://github.com/golang/go/issues/18539" TITLE : proposal: beginner issues BODY : i propose that a beginner label is added to issues deemed suitable for people dipping their toes in developing golang itself. currently, as a novice, it can be quite difficult find an appropriate issue to work on. partly due to unfamiliarity with golang internals as well as speculation on my part old-timers doing drive-by commits that while trivial to them, would be suitable for beginners to start out with. specifically, begin adding beginner -label to suitable issues. if that's not successful, remove the tag agin. if successful, possibly have frequent committers show some restraint in doing drive-by commits and do beginner-issues instead. same can possibly be done for cl reviews with beginner-review .
