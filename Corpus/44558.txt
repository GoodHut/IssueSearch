 URL : "https://github.com/konsolas/AAC-Issues/issues/819" TITLE : fastbow config option BODY : currently, violation number 1 causes the you're firing shots too quickly message and bow usage cancel https://gyazo.com/b1e0215e92cdd763e38fa1f972cad204 i think it is time to add the configuration for sending the message and canceling on a higher violation if desired. this has become more relevant after recent versions of aac are prone to detect bow spam, sometimes with, sometimes without lag. example: if block_ticks is >0, after how many violations should the warning message and cancel take place? min_vl: 1
