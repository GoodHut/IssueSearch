 URL : "https://github.com/owickstrom/purescript-spec-quickcheck/issues/8" TITLE : compile error with 0.11.6? BODY : i've used the example code from the readme to create a test file: module test.main where import prelude import control.monad.eff eff import test.quickcheck === , /== import test.spec describe, it import test.spec.quickcheck qcrunnereffects, quickcheck import test.spec.reporter.console consolereporter import test.spec.runner run main :: eff qcrunnereffects unit main = run consolereporter do describe math do it works $ quickcheck -> n 2 / 2 === n it works again $ quickcheck -> n + 1 2 /== n but building and running the code with pulp gives this error: compiling test.main error found: in module test.main at test/qcs-spec.purs line 7, column 30 - line 7, column 45 cannot import type qcrunnereffects from module test.spec.quickcheck it either does not exist or the module does not export it. ... i can see that module source does export qcrunnereffects so i'm not sure if this is a problem in my complete-newb purescript setup or something that has changed in the language since the last release of this module.
