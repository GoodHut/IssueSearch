 URL : "https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-example-passport/issues/103" TITLE : passport github example BODY : this example is needed, most engineers are going to want github over social logins. i found that the way to get github to work as a provider i had to provide the entire url for my app as the callbackurl . it would be great if this were better documented. it took a ton of guessing and errors to get it working. i'll open a pr with a better example if someone can't. github : { provider : github , module : passport-github , strategy : oauth2strategy , clientid : process.env.github_client_id, clientsecret : process.env.github_client_secret, callbackurl : https://my.app.com/auth/github/callback , authpath : /auth/github , callbackpath : /auth/github/callback , successredirect : /auth/account , failureredirect : /login , scope : email , profile , failureflash : true }
