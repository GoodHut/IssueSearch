 URL : "https://github.com/abyzovlab/CNVnator/issues/56" TITLE : which versions work? BODY : hi, could someone please post which combination of versions for cnvnator and root work together? i've tried to follow instructions given here, the cern root website and various versions of http://seqanswers.com/forums/showthread.php?t=16665, but so far, no success. i've tried recent versions as well as those root versions from around the time of the publication. the closest i could get to an installation was using !/usr/bin/env bash cnvnatorversion=0.3 rootversion=5.30.06 installdir=$home root rootpath=${installdir}/root cd ${installdir} wget -nc https://root.cern.ch/download/root_v${rootversion}.source.tar.gz tar -zxvf root_v${rootversion}.source.tar.gz cd ${rootpath} source ${rootpath}/bin/thisroot.csh ./configure make cnvnator echo getting cnvnator... cd ${installdir} wget -nc http://sv.gersteinlab.org/cnvnator/cnvnator_v${cnvnatorversion}.zip unzip -o ${installdir}/cnvnator_v${cnvnatorversion}.zip srcdir=${installdir}/cnvnator_v${cnvnatorversion}/src echo making samtools... cd ${srcdir}/samtools make printf exporting variables... rootsys=${rootpath} export rootsys ld_library_path=${ld_library_path}:${rootsys}/lib export ld_library_path source ${rootpath}/bin/thisroot.sh printf rootsys is ${rootsys} printf ld_library_path is ${ld_library_path} printf making cnvnator... cd ${srcdir} make echo ${rootsys} i had to remove -lphysics -lgraph3d which doesn't sound like it'd cause problems from the makefile, and manually link to pthread. at ieast that compiled, but i got a segfault for any bam file i tried. any help would be greatly appreciated.
