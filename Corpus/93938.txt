 URL : "https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/142" TITLE : automatically parse routes BODY : some guy came into irc and gave an example of how lavarel work with their controllers , and i become curious about implementing the same future in rocket, because it seems kinda neat. some example how it might work: impl controller for usercontroller { get /create fn create -> user {} } and then we can just simply mount it like that: mount /user , usercontroller this will allow us to automatically consider which functions implement what and etc. i guess it could be done via codegen, but i didn't take a look is it possible right now or not. or maybe we could consider something like this: impl controller for usercontroller { fn get_create -> user {} } with this we will just take a look at prefixes of functions and decide which method it uses, but i don't really know it this possible at all, maybe through some sort of macro. i don't really consider this as a very needed thing but it will kinda simplify mounting, so there will be no need to use use to import functions to a different file if you mount in a different place. and i guess i would like to hear what @sergiobenitez will say about such enhancement, and if it's possible or even needed i'd take a look and implement such thing.
