 URL : "https://github.com/openzim/gutenberg/issues/50" TITLE : smarter download approach BODY : to download each book, gutenberg2zim tries a list of url pattern where the book file s might be. we have no way to know, for sure, where the files are. the reason behind this is that over time the gutenberg project has chosen many different methodologies. therefore, to do download file, the script has a hardcoded list of potential urls where to download the file s and the script just go through each of then until one suceeds. most of the time, the script makes more tha 4-5 tries before catching the right one. each try cost time, 05-1 second. that's why it would be nice to make a smart guess about which url pattern in the list might better work, and a propose a method. each time a url pattern has been proven successful for a book, then move it from one to the top of the list and always tires the list of pattern from the top to the end. by doing so, we could have a far more faster download process.
