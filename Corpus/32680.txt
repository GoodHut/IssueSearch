 URL : "https://github.com/mcpierce/comixed/issues/3" TITLE : webp format support BODY : may i suggest that in the future you could add webp format support for the comic pages? i converted most of my comics into that format, as it can be significantly smaller than jpg or png without a noticible loss in quality. i can imagine that i am not the only one, since a smaller file size is preferable as probably most of the userbase consume their comics on mobile device, which normally have lower storage capacities than an pc.
