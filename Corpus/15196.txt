 URL : "https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi/issues/1420" TITLE : create test setup BODY : @vdp, i'm wondering if you have time to help with this? i'm thinking of creating a 'mini-librispeech setup' mainly for script-debugging/testing purposes. later we can create automated tests around it. e.g. egs/mini_librispeech/s5. i'm thinking on the order of 5 hours of training data, and using the existing test sets maybe focusing on the 'other' data-- if the wer is high, differences will be easier to see . we don't need too many options here-- my goal is to have a very limited amount of data to download from the site, so people don't spend too long doing downloads. most of the decisions here don't really matter, this will mostly be used for people to familiarize themselves with the kaldi scripts, and for regression testing. this may involve adding an extra file or two to openslr.org.
