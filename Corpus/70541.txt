 URL : "https://github.com/StudioJunkyard/summernote-image-attributes/issues/19" TITLE : where to include plugin BODY : sorry to be so dense, but i just couldn't see where to do this. in the readme https://github.com/studiojunkyard/summernote-cleaner 1-include-js it says include the following code after you include summernote. where exactly is that? i have a rails app that i've inherited, and i include summernote in a few different places gemfile, application.js, stylesheets/base.scss . none of those places seem the right spot for the html code the readme presents. any suggestions would be amazing!
