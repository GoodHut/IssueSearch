 URL : "https://github.com/gsstudios/Dorimanx-SG2-I9100-Kernel/issues/93" TITLE : random corruption of data BODY : the kernel has a history of randomly corrupting users data. i don't truly believe that the kernel all to blame for this issue, but it may be the way it is set up to fix partitions or something similar . it isn't entirely reproducible on all systems making it hard to get logs or any debug info that would greatly assist in pinpointing any causes. better keep this here so that it is kept in mind as a maintainer of this kernel.
