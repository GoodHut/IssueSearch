 URL : "https://github.com/JPDSousa/mongo-obj-framework/issues/25" TITLE : increase test coverage BODY : description :mag: ---------- test coverage is really useful in any kind of software project. smof greatly appreciates test coverage contributions. how to? :anguished: ------ :warning: do not panic! test coverage is not rocket science! :warning: smof uses maven https://maven.apache.org/ to run tests. so, in order to run existing tests and create your own: - clone the repository; - be sure to have maven installed in your machine check the maven https://maven.apache.org/ homepage on how to download and install maven; - start a mongodb instance: - mongod --port 20720 - you can, optionally, specify a path to the database or any other valid options, just make sure the port is set to 27020, which is the port used by smof to run tests; - hit mvn clean verify in the projects root folder i.e. mongo-obj-framework by default, and wait for the green text stating that everything went fine; - now you're good to go. add tests to the test source folder src/test/java and increase the test coverage! - remember to create test classes that end with test , such as exampletest.java , as maven surefire plugin will only run classes with that pattern; - focus on code that is not tested yet. you can resort to the codecov reports, or even to the reports generated by maven jacoco plugin, stored in {project.root}/target/site/jacoco open the index.html for a sort-of-pretty report .
