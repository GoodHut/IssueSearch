_originally opened as https://github.com/pedsnet/data-quality-analysis-temp/issues/13_ ---- there are a whole bunch of checks, primarily aa-002 checks, that strictly define accepted values. for example, there are only 8 acceptable values for observation_concept id manually written into the script. we may want to rewrite the order bins for these checks to make them less pedsnet specific.
