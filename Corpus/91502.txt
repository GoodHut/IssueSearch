 URL : "https://github.com/FIX94/Nintendont/issues/420" TITLE : triforce bios not loading BODY : i have the triforce bios with crc-32 d1883221 and renamed to segaboot.bin but the triforce games starts normally without the trifroce logo. that bios file is the official bios from mame, does it need some kind of fix like the games to run with nintendont? thanks! i tried a different bios file i deleted it so i don't know the crc-32, but i know it was different and it didn't worked either...
