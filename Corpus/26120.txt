 URL : "https://github.com/OpenTriply/YASGUI.YASR/issues/93" TITLE : add support for gml BODY : geosparql defines two serialization profiles: wkt and gml. if there is a javascript-based gml parser, then it would be nice to also support the parsing of gml literals. the parser should be able to parse gml snippets not full documents that describe exactly one instance of uml class gm_object / xml element gml:abstractgeometry . a simple example is a gml point: xml <gml:point><gml:coordinates>1.1, 2.2</gml:coordinates></gml:point> which encodes the same data as the following wkt serialization: wkt point 1.1 2.2
