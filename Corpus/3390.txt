 URL : "https://github.com/Shopify/themekit/issues/489" TITLE : out of memory BODY : hi there, i have a pretty interesting use case. we are using the themekit tool to deploy a single theme to multiple stores. we have one dev store and 22 public stores. all stores use the same theme and settings from the dev store per the requirements. we used this tool to deploy to all the stores by manipulating the multiple environments for each store https://shopify.github.io/themekit/configuration/ config-file . i am finding that the themekit tool crashes when uploading ~300 files to each store. granted this is not an intended use for this tool, i wanted to see what you think about the error i am getting. what i expected to happen upload to n stores at the same time. what actually happened error: runtime: out of memory: cannot allocate 524288-byte block 1342177280 in use fatal error: out of memory runtime stack: runtime.throw 0x784bd4, 0xd /usr/local/cellar/go/1.8/libexec/src/runtime/panic.go:596 +0x7c runtime.largealloc 0x7dbf8, 0x448c00, 0x41baacb0 /usr/local/cellar/go/1.8/libexec/src/runtime/malloc.go:797 +0xdb runtime.mallocgc.func1 /usr/local/cellar/go/1.8/libexec/src/runtime/malloc.go:690 +0x31 runtime.systemstack 0x11006000 /usr/local/cellar/go/1.8/libexec/src/runtime/asm_386.s:337 +0x5e runtime.mstart /usr/local/cellar/go/1.8/libexec/src/runtime/proc.go:1132 goroutine 273 running : runtime.systemstack_switch steps to reproduce 1. setup deployment for 10+ stores 2. upload the theme to these stores 3. see error? : my environment os including version : mac osx 10.12.6 16g1036 macbook pro 15inch 2015 16gb ram also failing on a aws windows jenkins box, but also fails on macbook so its likely just an issue with total memory. themekit version: themekit 0.7.5 darwin/amd64 ignore files if any : resources .gitignore .ds_store resources is a folder we use gulp to build into assets .
