 URL : "https://github.com/laochailan/taisei/issues/47" TITLE : malloc error checking BODY : as you may know, taisei doesn’t take checking the return value of malloc for null seriously and would segfault if null is returned. now with all the dialog graphics and possibly bgm in the future, it is possible that some people will try to run this on their soc/toaster and it will run out of memory and maybe return null on some kind of system and the user will not know it’s because of that. maybe we should define some malloc function that will panic and print an error message if that happens and replace all mallocs by that. i do not know if the builtin references and linked-list implementations or anything else rely on malloc 0 == null though. but that could be retained by something like void tmalloc size_t size { void p = malloc size ; if p == 0 && size != 0 oh_no ; return p; }
