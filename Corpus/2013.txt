 URL : "https://github.com/OpenChemistry/tomviz-superbuild/issues/167" TITLE : osx python 3 BODY : issue to report progress to migrating osx builds to python 3. you need the environment variable cflags=-i${cmake_osx_sysroot}/usr/include to make python build obviously cmake will sub in the appropriate sdk location . but the superbuild needs to add it to the build flags it gives the project otherwise they conflict and i haven't figured this out yet.
