 URL : "https://github.com/groovy/groovy-eclipse/issues/347" TITLE : navigation not working BODY : this use case is taken from the old greclipse-1755, but the symptom is different. create a groovy project which depends on org.hibernate:hibernate-core:3.5.6-final and write the following class: groovy package f import org.hibernate.sqlquery import org.hibernate.sessionfactory import org.hibernate.impl.sessionfactoryimpl class f { static main args { sessionfactory sf = new sessionfactoryimpl null, null, null, null, null sqlquery query = sf.currentsession.createsqlquery 'select bla bla' } } when i opened greclipse-1755, greclipse was confusing org.hibernate.session.createsqlquery string with org.hibernate.classic.session.createsqlquery string, string, class , which is deprecated, and hence it was showing my method call with the deprecation highlighting. this does not happen any more, but what i see now is that i can't navigate to org.hibernate.impl.sessionfactoryimpl.getcurrentsession by hitting f3 on currentsession or to org.hibernate.session.createsqlquery string by hitting f3 on createsqlquery . eclipse does nothing, apart from writing current text selection cannot be opened in an editor in the status bar. by the way, i noticed a lot of such problems in one of our main projects, but it's hard to extract a small and sharable use case from there. while trying to reproduce greclipse-1755 i could finally reproduce this behaviour, i hope you'll be able to reproduce as well.
