BODY : hi all, i was hoping to find out more information regarding using your model in my current standalone android app. i'm interested in keeping the same domain initially as i'm only attempting to incorporate this model within android. would i just need the data.h5, params.json, and img.h5 files or would i be able to skip that step since my domain is the same? thanks.
