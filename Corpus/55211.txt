 URL : "https://github.com/clenk/multiscanner/issues/14" TITLE : improve pefile mapping BODY : when the pefile module is enabled we can get errors about the number of fields being exceeded. while we could just increase that setting, a better solution is probably to use nested fields or key/value objects. this should be used for exports, imports, and sections in pefile. see https://discuss.elastic.co/t/limit-of-total-fields-1000-in-index-has-been-exceeded/87280/4
