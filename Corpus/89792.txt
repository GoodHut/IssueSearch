 URL : "https://github.com/exercism/trackler/issues/42" TITLE : remove blurb from readme. BODY : https://github.com/exercism/x-common/pull/775 moves the first line of the description from the blurb to the description so that the description will be self contained. if trackler prepends the blurb to the description, the blurb will appear to be doubled up in the readme. so remove the blurb from the readme. in order to avoid the requirement of perfect synchronisation between x-common and trackler, i propose these steps: - do not add the blurb to the readme if it matches the start of the description. once changes to the descriptions are committed in x-common. https://github.com/exercism/x-common/pull/775 - remove blurb from the readme completely.
