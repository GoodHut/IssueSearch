 URL : "https://github.com/ieee-vgtc/ieeevis.org/issues/40" TITLE : papers vs. cfp links BODY : > yes, sorry, so on ieeevis.org, when i click call for participation it takes me to a page: http://ieeevis.org/year/2017/info/call-participation/call-for-participation > we would like instead if you click on papers that it takes you to http://ieeevis.org/year/2017/info/call-participation/call-for-participation as currently all of the info on that page relates to papers. > however, i can imagine that maybe that page gets further additions later and that's why the link was as it is? anyway, hopefully this makes sense and it's always open for discussion . thanks! > -ross ! ieee_vis_2017 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/412089/21966597/4843a1ca-db44-11e6-9601-e9d66cffbf7a.png
