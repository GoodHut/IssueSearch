BODY : thanks for sharing great templates! i've learnt aws architecture through these. thanks! - j request - bug - new feature - refactor - x question - documentation - tests - other details could you explain why bastion template has an iam role? i think i don't need any role at all because it is just a host to jump to private servers.
