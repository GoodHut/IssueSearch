 URL : "https://github.com/Teemperor/clang-modules-bugs/issues/5" TITLE : cache path is different BODY : it seems in root's cmake we sometimes resolve symlinks when passing the cache path. on the build nodes we have /mnt/build/... and /build -> /mnt/build/... and sometimes we pass cache-path with one path and one time with the other which breaks sanity checks with the pch ? as they should have the same path.
