 URL : "https://github.com/roostalol/RNGHelper/issues/35" TITLE : save and load BODY : it would be nice if it were possible to save the current state of all of the next boxes in the program to a file, and load that state from the file that was created. thus, if had already filled out something like: ! ff12rnghelper_2017-08-10_18-01-53 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30282035/29194149-54837c6c-7df6-11e7-9add-5139b3ee67ba.png i would want to hit save, creating a file which i could load to reproduce this state. the position of the rng does not need to be saved, nor does the last cure value... but everything else would be nice.
