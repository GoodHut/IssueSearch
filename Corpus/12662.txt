 URL : "https://github.com/klum-dsl/klum-ast/issues/56" TITLE : read only models BODY : since the basic idea is a quasi static model, it might be an interesting idea to make the model more or less read only. this would mean that the convenience setters are dynamically added, but invisible to client code. one option to achieve this could be to inject all created methods not into the class itself, but rather into a separate trait. this trait could be applied during create. to keep backward compatibility, this trait must be auto applied by default. open question: can a trait be removed again? dynamically adding a trait creates a new object...
