 URL : "https://github.com/thraaawn/CompactMachines/issues/221" TITLE : mitigate room wall bypass BODY : currently, other mods can allow players to exit the compact machine room volume, allowing access to the remainder of its pocket dimension. i'm looking at you, enderio. any chance we could get something added to mitigate this sort of thing? randomthings also has an extra-dimensional room available. they deny access to the rest of the dimension by teleporting players that are outside the room volume back inside unless they happen to be in creative mode.
