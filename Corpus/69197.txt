 URL : "https://github.com/Thutmose/Pokecube/issues/192" TITLE : suggestions about forms BODY : could you please make it possible for dimensions or moves to change the form of a pokemon? for example, in the nether, giratina would be in it's origin form. also, sunsteel strike would turn solgaleo into it's radiant sun phase temporarily. thanks!
