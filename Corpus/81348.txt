 URL : "https://github.com/vmware/clarity/issues/783" TITLE : wizard: page ids are off BODY : <!-- please fill out the following. we may close incomplete issues. --> select one ... check one with x x bug feature request enhancement this is not a critical issue because the wizard doesn't really use the ids for anything but it could affect users who are trying to use ids. reproduction of behavior https://plnkr.co/edit/qsy2chj9p9mwk2ez35ed?p=preview the logic in assigning a page an id is failing. i think this is due to a falsy return when the id counter or the id passed in is zero. here's a screenshot of devtools inspecting the problem. note the disconnect between the first page's _id value and the value assigned to the id. zero versus 3... those should not be different. <img width= 804 alt= screen shot 2017-04-24 at 5 32 04 pm src= https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2728359/25361554/6f2994d4-2914-11e7-8011-24bda66159e1.png >
