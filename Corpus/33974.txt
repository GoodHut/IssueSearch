 URL : "https://github.com/SuperDARN/rst/issues/113" TITLE : binary help messages BODY : as found in 111, there are a few binaries that could use some work to make them a little more user friendly at the command line. test_fitex2 also doesn't behave as usual, though if you try to give it a -new it at least gives a warning, but --help doesn't offer anything outside of this pr, but i'll start an issue to note it . same with test_lmfit . lagfr_fix doesn't seem to have any help notation at all. make_fitex doesn't seem to have any help notation at all. same for make_fitex2 and make_lmfit i get that these were more recently binaries that were written by folks that aren't with superdarn anymore, but if they're in our package, we should acknownledge where we need to do some work.
