 URL : "https://github.com/nltk/nltk/issues/1695" TITLE : ibm-3 model is too slow BODY : hi, recently, i want to use ibm model3 in nltk for word alignment. however, the running time is really unaffordable e.g., for training over 100 aligned sentences, 4 hours are needed per iteration . is there anybody encounter the same problem? p.s: ibm-2 and ibm-1 only cost a few seconds on the same machine.
