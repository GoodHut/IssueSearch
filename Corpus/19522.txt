 URL : "https://github.com/gnuradio/volk/issues/129" TITLE : add fma operations BODY : avx2/fma support exists, but only two protokernels use it volk_32f_x2_dot_prod_32f, volk_32fc_x2_multiply_32fc because it was slower on new hardware in the first generation. now, it appears fma has advantages on the latest hardware. several multiply and dot_prod operations might benefit from fma operations, so create new protokernels where appropriate.
