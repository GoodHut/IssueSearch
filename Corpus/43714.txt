 URL : "https://github.com/mozilla/network-api/issues/28" TITLE : decide on auth system BODY : we're trying to decide on what auth strategy to use for the network-api and for our cms work in general. it would be good to consolidate our auth strategy across our cms implementations. our current thought is to use github authentication here. rationale for using github - allows us to manage permissions for existing staff using the github mozilla org's teams to assign who has access to what - allows us to easily add contributors and assign permissions based on the org teams network pulse uses google auth instead. we would like to understand the rationale behind choosing that for the pulse api as well as understanding the pros/cons of using google auth vs. github auth vs. something else.
