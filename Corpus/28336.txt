 URL : "https://github.com/xinra-it/review-community/issues/62" TITLE : force client update BODY : if the client has a different major version than the server, i.e. breaking changes were introduced to the api, the client is forced to update. this should not require a seperate request. the server's version could be included in the /init endpoint but that could break itself. proposal: use a header to transmit the server number.
