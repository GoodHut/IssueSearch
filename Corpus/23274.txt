 URL : "https://github.com/edubart/otclient/issues/837" TITLE : openssl api change BODY : steps to reproduce include any configuration/script required to reproduce 1. build otclient against openssl 1.1.0x version expected behaviour the crypto module does compile. actual behaviour the crypto module does not compile. detail basically what happens is that the openssl 1.1.0x and up changed the api and broke backwards compatibility. the rsa struct members are no longer accessible directly. currently one can just build otclient against the older version of openssl but eventually distros will start shipping the newer so i'm posting it as something to keep in mind. some more information on the topic: https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/openssl_1.1.0_changes http://stackoverflow.com/a/40550964
