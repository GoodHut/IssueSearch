 URL : "https://github.com/fibasile/nueval-project/issues/14" TITLE : complete mark irreversible BODY : something strange happened. in both local and global evaluation app, these are the steps i followed: 1- i marked complete the single week and if it the week is marked complete i can still change the feedback. see image 1, it refers to the global eval. ! image_1 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18658744/27514970-38adfa2a-5999-11e7-9355-e8a6cfac3384.png 1- i marked all the units as complete and the option to change the feedback of the single week disappeared. see image_2, it refers to the global eval. even if i change the outcomes status bar, the week remains complete. ! image_2 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18658744/27514995-cf8a5268-5999-11e7-977d-05f2b2cac978.png it looks like if you mark all the weeks as complete, you can't change your feedback anymore. is it ok like that?
