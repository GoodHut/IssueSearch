 URL : "https://github.com/CelticMinstrel/wesnoth/issues/350" TITLE : add after death event BODY : original submission https://gna.org/bugs/index.php?21707 by elvish_pillager on 2014-02-21 fairly self explanatory. this event would trigger after a unit has been removed from the map, including after plague is applied. in one of my add-ons, i wish to modify units that have been created by plague, so i detect plague and kill the unit ahead of time in a die event to replace it myself. this is awkward and doesn't work with custom plague abilities. another benefit is simply to be able to replace the dead unit without invalidating the die event for any other add-on that is active in the scenario. it's a very minor thing, but it would be useful.
