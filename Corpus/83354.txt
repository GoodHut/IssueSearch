 URL : "https://github.com/mapnik/python-mapnik/issues/146" TITLE : can't install on centos 7 BODY : i'm unable to install the library after downloading it. i tried in and out of a virtualenv. it might be that i need plain mapnik installed first, but i had troubles doing that too. i have everything working fine on ubuntu, but i need to shift to centos 7 for various reasons, and mapnik is proving to be problematic there. thanks in advance. > python-mapnik-master $ python setup.py install traceback most recent call last : file setup.py , line 114, in <module> lib_path = os.path.join check_output mapnik_config, '--prefix' ,'lib' file setup.py , line 20, in check_output output = subprocess.check_output args file /usr/lib64/python2.7/subprocess.py , line 568, in check_output process = popen stdout=pipe, popenargs, kwargs file /usr/lib64/python2.7/subprocess.py , line 711, in __init__ errread, errwrite file /usr/lib64/python2.7/subprocess.py , line 1327, in _execute_child raise child_exception oserror: errno 2 no such file or directory
