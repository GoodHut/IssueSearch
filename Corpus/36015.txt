 URL : "https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx/issues/1282" TITLE : flow typecheck error BODY : hey, all! there looks to be a small error in our flow typings definitions. having the following code js import { observable } from 'mobx'; and running flow typechecking yeilds the following: node_modules/mobx/lib/mobx.js.flow:273 273: <t> imodifierdescriptor<t> : t, ^ unexpected token < looking at the source in this repo, i think its just a simple syntax error that _should_ look like this: js <t> value: imodifierdescriptor<t> : t, that being said, i'm a flow noob, so i could be missing some big picture details or something. i can open a pr with this one liner change if you guys want. thanks!
