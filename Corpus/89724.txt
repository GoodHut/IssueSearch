 URL : "https://github.com/tobie/specref/issues/421" TITLE : references best practices BODY : the docs provide a good overview https://github.com/tobie/specref manual-changes of how to submit new references, but i haven't found anything on best practices of what a reference should look like. for example, the iana-cose was originally a reference called iana-cose-algs-reg in the fido specifications, and the fido reference was to a specific section https://www.iana.org/assignments/cose/cose.xhtml algorithms of the iana spec. another set of odd links from fido are to the bluetooth specifications: js btccc : { publisher : bluetooth sig , title : client characteristic configuration. bluetooth core specification 4.0, volume 3, part g, section 3.3.3.3 , href : https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/adopted-specifications }, btcore : { publisher : bluetooth sig , title : bluetooth core specification 4.0 , href : https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/adopted-specifications }, btdis : { publisher : bluetooth sig , title : device information service v1.1 , href : https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/adopted-specifications }, btgap : { publisher : bluetooth sig , title : generic access profile. bluetooth core specification 4.0, volume 3, part c, section 12 , href : https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/adopted-specifications }, // ... you'll note that they have the same url, but the titles of the references point to specific section numbers. the url doesn't even link to the specification itself, but links to a landing-page that seems to have a non-stable url for a pdf... if i were to submit these references in their current form duplicate urls, section names in titles, links to specific sections, etc. would that be a black mark upon my name? would the changes be rejected? or is it really anything goes ?
