 URL : "https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs/issues/124" TITLE : add baseurl setting BODY : i tried to host on github: deployment via /docs folder on master branch . but i did not good well. in my case i could not display the image because i forgot to add the baseurl setting. sure, it is written in the first section. but, it is easy to forget for beginners. i propose that we add setting baseurl. how about this steps? 1. create a <your-project> git repository on github. 2. git clone <your-project-url> && cd <your-project> 3. make your website work locally hugo server or hugo server -t <yourtheme> and open your browser to http://localhost:1313. 4. change baseurl in config.toml 5. change publishdir in config.toml 6. run hugo thank you.
