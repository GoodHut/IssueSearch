 URL : "https://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/iot-python/issues/70" TITLE : disk buffering feature BODY : hi, i would like to know if the ibmiotf library can handle disk buffering ? and if it doesn't, does anyone know what would be my best alternative ? my use-case is that i have a device that is sending logs throughout the day, if my device loses connection and get it back later on it's fine because the unsent messages are properly stored in ram. but if the device reboots then i lose everything. thanks,
