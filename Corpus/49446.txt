 URL : "https://github.com/Etar-Group/Etar-Calendar/issues/150" TITLE : toolbar is scrollable BODY : the toolbar can be scrolled upwards. in the day and week view this creates an empty gray area at the bottom. see the following screenshot: ! scrolled_toolbar https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6775792/22310636/2dbe3a0e-e350-11e6-8604-c4619dc01d16.jpg it is even possible to scroll the toolbar upwards until it vanishes and in this case it's not possible to scroll down again. i am not sure what the intended behavior is since the code looks like scrolling is activated explicitely. i would prefer to simply disable the scrolling of the toolbar and can prepare a pull request if this is desired.
