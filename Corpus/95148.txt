 URL : "https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-chrome/issues/207" TITLE : crash after rtsp handshake BODY : so i got a 1070, installed geforce experience, ticked to allow experiential features and then installed the plugin in chrome and tried to launch a game with it. however, for whatever reason no matter which game i choose it will crash during the part where it is establishing the rtsp handshake. there is no error message of any kind so i have no idea what could be causing it and what i should be looking into. i uninstalled eset and rebooted my pc but still no different, and as i have never had a nvida card before or used the geforce software i don;t think i should need to reinstall it either.
