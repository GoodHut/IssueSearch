 URL : "https://github.com/cdauth/node-pgp/issues/9" TITLE : help using this module? BODY : this is not an issue with this module per se, except that i do not understand how in the world to use it. i need to leverage the node-pgp-mail module to send encrypted email. that module requires a node-pgp keying object, which i understand i can generate fairly easily, per the docs. however, that would only get me an empty node-pgp keyring with no keys. so if i wish to create a key, or load one into the keyring, i can use keyring.addkey keyinfo, callback . the only problem i have is that i do not have any keyinfo and cannot tell how to generate keyinfo to add this key to the keyring object. am i missing something? could someone point me in the direction of how to either generate a key with keyinfo, or load that info from a saved private/public key?
