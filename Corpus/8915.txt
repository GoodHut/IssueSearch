 URL : "https://github.com/Cacti/plugin_webseer/issues/1" TITLE : site down email BODY : i am not able to get an email to send when a site is down. i see this is using the php mail function, and have made sure i can send test emails from all methods successfully, so i don't think its a mail config issue on cacti. i am also not seeing anything in the cacti logs other than the system stats webseer messages every 5 mins.
