 URL : "https://github.com/carbon-io/carbond/issues/293" TITLE : id query questions BODY : in find we have supportsidquery and idparameterdefinition which is the schema for the id query. 1. should we rename idparameterdefinition to idqueryschema ? schema is a more consistent with our naming conventions than definition . this also makes it clear it's defining a _query object_ for the id, not defining the idparameter itself. it was confusing to me when i looked at it first. it looked like it might have an impact on the id parsing for findobject , deleteobject , etc. 2. should we make idparameterdefinition private and have it be generated from the collection schema? i'd argue that it's not something that should be configurable.
