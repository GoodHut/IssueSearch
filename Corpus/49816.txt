 URL : "https://github.com/jstrube/LCIO.jl/issues/26" TITLE : update to lcio v02-08 BODY : the new release has additional bitfields on the track. this needs additional getters in the bindings. the setters will be added upon request only info about whether an mcparticle is a secondary is unlikely to be set from julia. i can only think of merging/skimming tools where this would be useful .
