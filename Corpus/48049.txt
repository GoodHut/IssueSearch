 URL : "https://github.com/kamal1978/LTFHC/issues/168" TITLE : register slow to load BODY : i've always noticed that the register takes a long time to load, and that's when i had only 5-10 patients entered. the ltfhc team in the field now has ~150 patients entered, and they say the register takes several minutes to load. this is so long to the point of making the tablet app useless to the health workers. what can we do to decrease this time significantly to < 2 seconds? do we need more powerful servers? a better algorithm? cacheing the data for easy retrieval?
