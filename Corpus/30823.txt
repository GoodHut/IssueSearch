 URL : "https://github.com/cubecart/v6/issues/1714" TITLE : recaptcha v1 issues BODY : i came across this issue in v6.1.8 and still have same issue in upgrade whilst developing a plugin. i spent over 60 hrs trying to find the issue within my plugin before i realized it was a cubecart bug after testing on a clean 6.1.9 install. although not recommended, whilst it is an available option it needs to work correctly. if user enter incorrectly register, contact form, review etc they receive error message but if user only enter 1st part of image and submit it accepts without error.
