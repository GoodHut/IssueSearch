 URL : "https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/issues/161" TITLE : upload a document BODY : i know this is supposed to be accessible through redmine 3.4, which isn't yet published, but since i saw a 'upload' method in the redmine object, i was wondering what could be done through it... and especially if we could upload a file already? if not as a document, then we could update the url in a wiki page, for instance, and i know updating a wiki page through pythonredmine is possible since i use it about every day for my project. i didn't try the 'upload' method, though. i've used the 'download' method often, especially since we didn't have to download the file at once and could display a progress bar. as for uploading, i guess that's not possible. still, what can we do for the time being? is it possible to upload a file and fetch its url, for instance?
