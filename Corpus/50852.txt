 URL : "https://github.com/Macaulay2/M2/issues/610" TITLE : add code to schur2.cpp BODY : the following function in e/schur2.cpp needs to be written. not doing so means that one cannot sort elements of schur rings. i am removing the warning in the source code, since this issue would solve that problem. int schurring2::compare_elems const ring_elem f, const ring_elem g const { warning compare_elems method needs to be written return 0; }
