 URL : "https://github.com/celery/django-celery-beat/issues/69" TITLE : pypy solar support BODY : i notice that now ephem has been added to the tests to support solar schedules, the pypy test environments are failing because pypy does not support the c backed for pyephem and so the dependency cannot be installed. how should this be handled? i think we need to exclude solar from the pypy tests and make a note in the documentation about pypy support. however, this sort of decision is above my pay grade.
