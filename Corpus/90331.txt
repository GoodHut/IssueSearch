 URL : "https://github.com/ExpeditionRPG/expedition-art/issues/3" TITLE : separate raw / meta repo? BODY : seeing as this gets used by the app, card creator and quest creator, which then all have to download 100's of mb of raw art assets... thoughts on splitting out all of the other art old drafts, raw / editable files, etc to a separate -art-raw or -art-meta repo? would make maintenance more of a pain, so maybs not worth it at this point
