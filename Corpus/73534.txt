 URL : "https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware/issues/2145" TITLE : create unit tests in lua BODY : it would be extremely helpful to have a single lua script that anyone could run to test hard-independent modules. whenever we cut a release we do so w/o having done any structured and reproducible testing. i understand and accept that it's difficult to do serious automated testing for sensor/actor modules because it requires the respective hardware to be installed. however, it'd be fairly straightforward to test all other modules at least partially e.g. wifi basic stuff , timer, net/tls, http, sjson, sntp, perf, mqtt against public broker , file, cron, bit etc. this is related to 516 i.e. a light version of it .
