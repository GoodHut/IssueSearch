 URL : "https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/Adrenaline/issues/165" TITLE : cso breaks loading BODY : i copied a cso in /iso folder this causes adrenaline to hang when trying to create a list, eventually it crashes with a generic error. after that adrenaline only wants to show a black screen. a system reboot is required to start adrenaline once more. the workaround seems to be to decompress the cso to a iso file.
