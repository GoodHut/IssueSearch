 URL : "https://github.com/pmarks-net/ipvfoo/issues/32" TITLE : firefox compatibility bugs BODY : i'm creating this issue to track problems that occur only when running ipvfoo on firefox https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/ipvfoo-pmarks/ . - cached requests do not include the ip address. reported at https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1395020 - popup window has a horizontal scrollbar. reported at https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1395025 - when i right-click an ip address, the look up address on bgp.he.net menu often has the wrong enabled/disabled state, and nothing happens when i click it. i haven't explored the cause yet.
