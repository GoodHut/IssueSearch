 URL : "https://github.com/zkayser/pokerex_client/issues/36" TITLE : add pagination for rooms BODY : pagination is currently rendering, but it is not robust it renders page numbers from 1 to whatever the total page count available is with no truncation and does not currently emit a message that creates any real action. the pagination buttons can be clicked, and in response, a phoenix.push should be initiated that will send the server a get_page message. in response, the client should render the new list of room/table entries sent back from the server. also, the active page number should be highlighted with a blue background and white text.
