 URL : "https://github.com/konsolas/AAC-Issues/issues/1016" TITLE : hitbox detection fix BODY : i dont know where to post ideas so i will post here. the hitbox-reach detection is really bad , it almost doesnt detect akrien and jigsaw. actually i think a fix would be instead of decreasing the hitbox vl with legit hits aac should clear it after 60 ticks of the last hitbox detection , because with jigsaw , akrien , etc it detects barely ok when youre far but when youre closer the vl automatically clear because of the legit clicks. adding a vl multiplier wont fix this as that can generate false positives. heres proof that the hitbox-reach detection is bad: ! 2017-10-12_04 49 51 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25271111/31485025-ce20f638-af08-11e7-8eb6-3cd140856d5a.png it just clears vls after getting closer! obviously heuristics takes care of jigsaw , but applying my fix will make aac unbypasseable with new cheat-clients based on hitbox modification.
