 URL : "https://github.com/projectNe10/Ne10/issues/170" TITLE : link error on armv8 BODY : i am trying to compile the ne10_sample_matrix_multiply program and get an error with linking: undefined reference to ne10_mulmat_3x3f'. sure enough that symbol is not in my libne10.a. i found a comment in <ne10_project>.cmakelist. if ${ne10_target_arch} strequal armv7 math module has not been optimized for aarch64. option ne10_enable_math build math functionalities to ne10 on physics module has not been optimized for aarch64. option ne10_enable_physics build physics functionalities to ne10 on endif i would re-build libne10.a for ne10_target_arch=armv7 just to see if the problem goes away but i am having trouble uninstalling the existing library. could using ne10_target_arch=aarch64 be my problem? i'll have to overcome my uninstall problem if it is. here is my command line: gcc ./obj/ne10_sample_matrix_multiply.o -l/home/chuck/ne10/projectne10-ne10-0c9f576/build/modules -lne10 -lm -o ./bin/ne10_sample_matrix_multiply.elf ./obj/ne10_sample_matrix_multiply.o: in function main': ne10_sample_matrix_multiply.c: .text.startup+0x174 : undefined reference to ne10_mulmat_3x3f' ne10_sample_matrix_multiply.c: .text.startup+0x184 : undefined reference to ne10_mulmat_3x3f' i've tried putting the linked directories ahead of the .o file since i usually mess that up without impacting the error. i think i will also try compiling ne10_sample_complex_fft.c to see if it works. i see a bunch of dsp functions among the symbols in my libne10.a.
