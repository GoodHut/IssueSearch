 URL : "https://github.com/killbill/killbill-cloud/issues/83" TITLE : kpm export account, pass 2 BODY : known issues - escape single quotes import is currently failing when a field contains the word didn't - state_or_providence should be state_or_province code cleanup - migrate export functionality into killbill-client-ruby and use it instead of calling net::http directly - remove checked-in test file lib/kpm/account_export_import.yml tests - change dangerous default database credentials in tests. use instead a specific user and database e.g. 'test_kpm' and update the readme to notify developers about the setup required to run these tests - create the needed schema in a setup method e.g. accounts table is required - dynamically create an account in kill bill instead of hardcoding 572cc280-1927-49d4-8fb0-d8319d13bfd5 - account_spec.rb requires mysql to be running, which is not always the case e.g. on travis . create a new rspec group e.g. test:mysql:spec in the rakefile so it is not run by default - pass the password as mysql_pwd see https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/password-security-user.html instead of the command line, otherwise mysql warnings can fail some tests this is a follow-up of https://github.com/killbill/killbill-cloud/issues/71.
