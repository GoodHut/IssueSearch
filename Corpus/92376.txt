 URL : "https://github.com/Shopify/polaris/issues/18" TITLE : why use px instead of em? BODY : –not an issue, just a question.– on typography https://polaris.shopify.com/visuals/typography , why using px instead of using em ? it's obvious that as a designer we have more control of everything using px , but using em or rem we put the user first, assuming his preferences and limitations. a person with visibility limitations can set his default font size as big on browser settings, but he won't see any difference in a site using px . i am not saying that px is bad, ugly and smell, just trying to understand the choice.
