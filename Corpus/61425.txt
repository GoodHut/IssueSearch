 URL : "https://github.com/pdumais/astban/issues/1" TITLE : astban, the old version BODY : sorry to contact you this way, i did send an email to the address listed on your site, but it was bounced... do you have a copy of the original c++ application? i used it on some older centos5 i386 honeypot vm's back in 2013. now i need to replace them with debian8 x64 vm's, and the old executable i created is of course not compatible. i know i saved the source back then, but it must have gotten deleted somewhere along the way. i really liked the flexibility of being able to filter invite, register, and options and setting different trigger thresholds for each. from there it would add the iptables rule as well as writing the ip to a file, that could be scraped via http for consolidation… that got a little long winded… anyway, if you do have a copy and you would be willing to share, i would greatly appreciate it. thanks!
