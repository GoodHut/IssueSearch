BODY : your project helped my get over a hurdle. one thing i added was a promise to the store actions syncall : syncall ctx { return new promise resolve, reject => { db.alldocs { include_docs: true } .then res => { ctx.commit 'settodos', res.rows.map row => row.doc resolve res }, error => { // http failed, let the calling function know that action did not work out reject error } } } then in a component mount i wait for promise and then work with data from couchdb. store.dispatch 'syncall' .then response => { // do stuff }, error => { console.error got nothing from server. prompt user to check internet connection and try again }
