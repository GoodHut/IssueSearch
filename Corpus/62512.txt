 URL : "https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/75" TITLE : components : workspaces BODY : create a new component/package based on the content in tfs: 1. workspace content templates 2. default site / workspaces section, _without_ the features that are published separately e.g. workflows! - should be executable multiple times likely a _tools_ package, not _install_ - the second part is _not imported by default_, only if a switch democontent:true is flipped - lives in a separate repo here on github question : nuget package, or a simple snadmin package that can be executed using the installer? they are almost the same basically, the nuget package would simply contain the snadmin package
