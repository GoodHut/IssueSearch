 URL : "https://github.com/otykier/TabularEditor/issues/107" TITLE : name of data types BODY : using the names of data types int64 / double / decimal is confusing. everybody understands int64, but decimal is currency in pivot table and fixed decimal number in power bi. double is decimal in both power pivot and power bi. it could be useful adding aliases, e.g.: int64 / integer / whole number decimal / currency / fixed decimal number double / floating point / decimal number? i'm not sure about the format, but power bi users are incredibly confused here.
