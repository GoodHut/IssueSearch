 URL : "https://github.com/Ascoware/get-iplayer-automator/issues/60" TITLE : losing pvr series-links BODY : this has been an ongoing issue for me through all versions and multiple os. every so often all pvr series-links will disappear. the only way to get them back is to manually re-add each one. i haven't figured out what triggers the wiping. where is the data stored? is it in a plain text file that can be copied and restored as needed?
