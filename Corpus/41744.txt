 URL : "https://github.com/pganssle/audio-feeder/issues/7" TITLE : add folder navigation BODY : my audiobooks are currently laid out such that folders are more or less a meaningful hierarchy fiction > science fiction, nonfiction > history, etc . ideally i would add navigation to allow filtering by everything below this level in the hierarchy, and some navigation elements to go with that.
