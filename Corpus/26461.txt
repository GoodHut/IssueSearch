 URL : "https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/issues/776" TITLE : azure functions sdk BODY : hello there! i was wondering why there isn't an azure functions sdk or maybe i missed it? . i know i can deploy the arm templates that create an azure function https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-infrastructure-as-code but compared to how you would do it using the cli https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-infrastructure-as-code it is much more tedious. thanks!
