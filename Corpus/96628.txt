 URL : "https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/issues/1327" TITLE : faster pcolormesh plotting BODY : hello, i've really enjoyed the heatmap code in seaborn, it makes plotting a dream. however, i'm making publication quality figures, and need to do a bit of editing in illustrator after the matplotlib figures have been made. when i made even a reasonably sized heatmap illustrator just can't open the thing. doing some digging it looks like pcolormesh blows up file sizes. it looks like recently pcolorfast has been added to matplotlib. i've been prototyping that out outside of seaborn, and it looks like we might be able to use it inside of seaborn. happy to do the legwork / pull request on this, but before diving in, i just wanted to check if there are any reasons you might have to not switch over from mesh to fast. thanks,
