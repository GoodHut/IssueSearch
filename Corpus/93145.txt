 URL : "https://github.com/linz/linz-lds-bde-schema/issues/19" TITLE : add function documentation BODY : this project contains 22 functions, but there's no documentation about their usage, so writing tests 18 is not possible due to lack of expected behavior information. i could extrapolate documentation from current behavior, detected by writing tests. @imincik let me know if you want me to take this path or there's some documentation elsewhere
