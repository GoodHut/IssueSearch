 URL : "https://github.com/mattsouthward/teacozy/issues/3" TITLE : copyright alignment off BODY : https://github.com/mattsouthward/teacozy/blob/master/index.html l90-l92 the reason that the copyright text is not aligning properly to the left is because this whole part is inside of your .content div, and if you look at your css you have the following styling for your .content div: justify-content: center; align-items: center; so this bottom text will be affected accordingly. i would try to find a way to get the copyright text outside of the .content div and put it within its own div and then align that to the left and it should work fine.
