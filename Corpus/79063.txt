 URL : "https://github.com/neelance/graphql-go/issues/52" TITLE : return structured errors BODY : suppose i am sending a mutation with a collection of fields, and i need to validate them i.e. check that string is an email, integer is valid age, string is valid phone number, string is valid credit card, etc . ideally, i would like to be able to returned a structured error when there were errors, something along the lines of: { errors: { 'email': 'invalid email address' 'contact.phone': 'invalid phone number', 'payment.creditcardnumber': 'this looks like an american express, not accepted here' ... } } producing the json above is quite simple depends on what validation library you use for your inputs, there are plenty of them out there . however, reading the examples its not clear to me that graphql-go it is possible to write a resolver that returns such a structured error.
