 URL : "https://github.com/sourcey/spectacle/issues/77" TITLE : objects and arrays BODY : hey, all. i am trying to document an object containing an array as well as some other fields. boiling it down to the bare minimum: javascript { int : integer , array : { name : string } } i tried two ways: yaml swagger: 2.0 definitions: bad_properties_good_example: type: object properties: int: type: integer array: description: an array of dummys type: array items: $ref: ' /definitions/dummy' good_properties_bad_example: type: object properties: int: type: integer array: type: array $ref: ' /definitions/dummy' dummy: type: object properties: name: type: string the former renders the example perfectly as pasted in above , but the properties come out as: bad_properties_good_example: object properties int: integer array: object an array of dummys ...which isn't as useful as it could be. good_properties_bad_example renders the properties as: good_properties_bad_example: object properties int: integer array: array<dummy> ...which is great, especially since dummy is a link to its definition, but the example comes out as: javascript { string : string , array : { name : string } } ...which is not. i am new to swagger, so i am hoping that i am just doing it plumb wrong. thanks in advance.
