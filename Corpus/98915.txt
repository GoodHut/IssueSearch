 URL : "https://github.com/fchollet/keras/issues/6433" TITLE : load multiple mini-batches BODY : from what i understand, keras loads data onto a gpu one mini-batch at a time. this is fine for situations where the data is very high dimensional, but i work in a domain where there are less than 1k features per a sample and i have up to 70m samples in an epoch. with a mini-batch size of 256, one mini-batch is roughly 1mb. is there anyway to get keras to preload data on to the gpu? my home-made theano implementation does this - i load data onto the card in huge chunks and walk through the chunks in small mini-batches.
