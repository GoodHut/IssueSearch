 URL : "https://github.com/cmus/cmus/issues/756" TITLE : allow to raise the window BODY : a lot of terminal emulator applications place windowid envvar with x window id. this can be used to raise the terminal window with running cmus application. i want to suggest implementing raise method of mpris proto using this envvar. using shell command it's possible even now: shell xdotool windowraise $windowid can be useful with cmus-remote . probably this long command could be implemented natively as well.
