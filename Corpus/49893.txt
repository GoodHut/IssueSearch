 URL : "https://github.com/iNZightVIT/iNZightPlots/issues/31" TITLE : url path construction BODY : in exporthtml , when file is an __absolute path__ e.g., /home/user/documents/file.html , the url returned by the function is invalid: /tmp/gibberish//home/user/documents/file.html . __reason__: file.path getwd , file just pastes them together with os specific separator. __quick fix__: i've replaced this with normalizepath file for now, which will return file if it's an absolute path, otherwise it will paste getwd in front of the path. _however_, it requires that the file already exists. {r} where am i? getwd 1 /tmp/dir what exists? list.files 1 myfile.html get the absolute path for file in working directory normalizepath myfile.html 1 /tmp/dir/myfile.html what exists in my documents folder? list.files /home/user/documents 1 anotherfile.html normalizing an absolute path does nothing normalizepath /home/user/documents/anotherfile.html 1 /home/user/documents/anotherfile.html but if the file doesn't exist, i can't normalize it normalizepath anotherfile.html 1 anotherfile.html warning message: in normalizepath anotherfile.html : path 1 = anotherfile.html : no such file or directory this may or may not be a permanent solution, so when you get a chance play around and make sure the behaviour is still as you expect.
