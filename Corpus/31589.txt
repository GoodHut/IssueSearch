 URL : "https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/issues/1956" TITLE : ssh specsefing port BODY : steps to reproduce i have a staging environment where i need to pass the port. the project user 3.4.1 and i upgraded to 3.10.1. i read the changelogs and did what i found necessary. if reasonable, you can help by creating a capistrano skeleton example project which reproduces the issue you are seeing. you can then upload the individual files to a github gist or a github project. others can simply modify the configuration to point at a test server/repository of their own. often times, an issue is resolved simply by making this test case. an example test case is here: https://gist.github.com/will-in-wi/527327e31af30b3eae2068e2965be05b expected behavior tell us what should happen actual behavior tell us what happens instead system configuration please link to the output of cap <stage> doctor in a github gist. thanks for helping improve capistrano!
