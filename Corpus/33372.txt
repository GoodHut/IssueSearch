 URL : "https://github.com/cdcharlebois/MendixFAB/issues/5" TITLE : add long-touch event BODY : if a user wants to implement an action on the base button but still use the drawer, we need to differentiate between the user's intent--whether we should launch the base action or open the drawer. i think it makes sense to implement an android-style long-touch event on this, so if the user taps the base button, it launches the base action, but if the user holds the base button, we show open the drawer.
