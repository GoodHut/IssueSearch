 URL : "https://github.com/dijs/wiki/issues/43" TITLE : usage from node BODY : hi, i'd love to use wiki from node 6.9 but since it doesn't support import i tried to use require instead. unfortunately i got an error 'wiki is not a function'. javascript let wiki = require 'wikijs' ; wiki .page 'batman' .then page => page.summary .then summary => { this.biasdefinition = summary } i also tried wiki.page but got 'wiki.page' is not a function. does it strictly require next node version? thanks
