 URL : "https://github.com/amirzaidi/Launcher3/issues/72" TITLE : hide icons from app drawer BODY : hi, would it be possible to add an option to toggle which apps are visible in the app drawer similar to the hide feature on nova launcher. this is just an idea as this launcher is designed to be a rootless port of the pixel launcher and therefore its users may not have root and not able to remove certain bloatware and system apps. adding this feature would allow people to simply hide the horrible manufacturer and bloatware apps from the launcher giving a cleaner and more stock like appearance.
