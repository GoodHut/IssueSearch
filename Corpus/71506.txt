 URL : "https://github.com/magicspon/barba-router/issues/1" TITLE : add name param to routes BODY : would be easier & more maintainable to specify names for routes, like: js export default { path: '/', name: 'home', // this view: home }, for now, the object given in routes events doesn't contain undocumented params: js export const home = { onenter { from, to, next } { console.log to.name // null next }, } what do you think? should we let any other arbitrary property being added?
