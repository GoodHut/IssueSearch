 URL : "https://github.com/LuminanceHDR/LuminanceHDR/issues/43" TITLE : artifacts in highlights BODY : the hdr files produced by luminance hdr 2.5.0 are unusable because they have gray-black artifacts in the highlights. i reproduced this using various input files, both pef and 16-bit tiff formats, using both linear and srgb gamma encoding, using all 6 hdr profiles in lhdr, and i confirm that saving the hdr to radiance rgbe, openexr or hdr tiff includes the artifacts. sample input files: https://filebin.net/mqthbifo9lt60pzx the link will expire in 2 months, please save the files. ! imgur-2017_04_19-14 21 54 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5844619/25179771/93ab9f1c-250b-11e7-9c62-42e39292e9a5.png
