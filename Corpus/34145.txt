 URL : "https://github.com/explosion/thinc/issues/39" TITLE : building thinc fails BODY : hi, i am trying to install spacy-nightly. building the latest version of thinc fails on: nvcc fatal : value 'sm_20' is not defined for option 'gpu-architecture' i am using cuda 9.0 and indeed its not supporting sm_20. trying to downgrade to cuda 8.0 adds back support for sm_20 but fails because it requires gcc with version smaller than 5. any way on making this work without all this version hell? any ideas on how to solve this? maybe there is something to change in the make file? a docker image is also a viable option. thank you.
