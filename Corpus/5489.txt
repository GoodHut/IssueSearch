 URL : "https://github.com/panda-re/panda/issues/220" TITLE : port to debian BODY : hi , i'm wondering if you can upgrade the llvm dependence. since the older version of llvm 3.x will be removed from debian. https://github.com/panda-re/panda/issues/107 issuecomment-225396169 if it is impossible, can you fork the needed llvm to panda. because if debian is to remove old llvm, after some while ubuntu is going to follow up.
