 URL : "https://github.com/gap-packages/JupyterKernel/issues/9" TITLE : rewrite hpc-gap support BODY : most of the hpc-gap support has been removed, but the only real difference at the moment should be that heartbeat can be handled in a hpc-gap thread as opposed to in a fork or a pthread hidden thread . of course we should think about adding support for asynchronous handling of multiple frontends etc.
