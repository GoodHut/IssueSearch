 URL : "https://github.com/LogicalDash/LiSE/issues/46" TITLE : non-diegetic data store BODY : currently, the positions of nodes, the graphics to use for them, and such things are kept in the same tables as actual, diegetic information about the game world. this is inconvenient because it means you can't, for instance, change a graphic and view the rest of the recorded history with the changed graphic; your change will cause a fork in the history, and the engine will start simulating things again, rather than just playing them back. this could result in a different outcome if the history includes decisions made by the player, and in any case, you'll get a bunch of redundant branches in the database that will make it harder to navigate. therefore, there should be a second database that just holds data pertaining to elide, not to the actual simulation. it may have a very similar structure to the diegetic database, and actions run in lise may call code in elide that changes how it looks, but they should be separate anyhow.
