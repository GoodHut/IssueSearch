BODY : okay here it is. been buggin me for a while now. and i am out of ideas!!! i have this pc with windows 10 pro. main account is administrator second accound is standard user problem is, that the standard user cannot find the plugin? plugin is being installed, but it is not being shown in teamspeak 3 plugins. even tryed to install it from administrator doesn't change a anything, but if i relog to administrator, and start up teamspeak 3 with ts3video, then it functions like it should. my guess is, that there is a permission problem with the plugin, when you have a computer with multiply accounts.
