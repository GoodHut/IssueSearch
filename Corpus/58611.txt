 URL : "https://github.com/VOREStation/VOREStation/issues/1574" TITLE : spiders spawn outside. BODY : brief description of the issue spider infestations seem to be able to spawn spiders outside. what you expected to happen for them to get spawned inside the colony, use ducts, destroy half the station. what actually happened a few spawned outside, and the phoron killed them. steps to reproduce - wait for a spider infestation - watch them have a chance to spawn outside, and die. code revision - found using the show server revision verb under the ooc tab. anything else you may wish to add: - location if it's a mapping issue, screenshots, sprites, etc.
