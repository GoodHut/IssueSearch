 URL : "https://github.com/yswery/PHP-DNS-SERVER/issues/23" TITLE : server not testable BODY : the server object is not very testable in its current form. i would suggest separating the encoders and decoders into their own respective classes. unit tests could then be developed to test and further develop the encoder and decoder methods. this would also serve to make the server object singularly responsible for handling the socket stream, therefore it would be less complex.
