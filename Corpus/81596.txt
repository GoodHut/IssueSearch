 URL : "https://github.com/openaq/openaq-api/issues/351" TITLE : /fetches data has changed BODY : just noticed this now but it looks like /fetches/ format has changed. looking at https://api.openaq.org/v1/fetches?limit=1 it looks like sometimes all the new measurements are included in the results section which is not desired behavior. not actually sure if this belongs here or over in openaq-fetch.
