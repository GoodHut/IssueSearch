 URL : "https://github.com/alexcrichton/cargo-local-registry/issues/5" TITLE : how to update properly? BODY : currently, i can't use cargo update to pull new versions of crates if i use local registry, because it tries to use that registry. and since cargo-local-registry works with cargo.lock it won't update on it's own. for now, i've solved it by temporarily renaming .cargo directory but i believe there should be more straightforward method. am i missing something or is this a missing feature?
