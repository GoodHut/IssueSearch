 URL : "https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/issues/47" TITLE : data about reuse ideas BODY : now that capsule reuse is a thing and fairing reuse is not far, we should get a better definition of reused . my idea would be to have a section like this, depending of the vehicule type: reuse: { booster: true, sidebooster1: false, sidebooster2: true, fairings: true, capsule: false, } but i'm not sure if it would the best way to do it.
