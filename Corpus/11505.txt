 URL : "https://github.com/kemcbride/Neolib/issues/2" TITLE : how to level up? BODY : haven't done this yet at all... it's probably really similar to how they do it in 'new game' screens though. then, relatedly, how to actually describe and follow a sequence of 'level up' steps given at the start of a playthrough. probably a different issue though
