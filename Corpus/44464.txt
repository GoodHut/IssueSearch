 URL : "https://github.com/docker/toolbox/issues/625" TITLE : exiting docker errors BODY : when i am done my docker session after starting it using docker quickstart terminal and i type exit , after the exit/logout data, i've been seeing this: > /applications/docker/docker quickstart terminal.app/contents/resources/scripts/start.sh: line 86: shell_session_update: command not found i don't see any adverse behavior but thought i would mention as part of cleanup. most recently noticed using docker 1.13.0 on macosx el capitan but this isn't the first time i've noticed so at least isn't super recent.
