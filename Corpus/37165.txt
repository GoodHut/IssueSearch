 URL : "https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/issues/993" TITLE : layout files trouble BODY : i have a theme and module in a same project has module.txt and theme.txt . i have a views/layout.cshtml for content items. then i have some controller actions. some use the layout, some don't and some needs another layout. so the troubles are as below: in a controller view file, e.g., if i assigned it to the same layout like layout = ../layout.cshtml i needed to use relative path see following bullet , i got: invalidoperationexception: renderbody has not been called for the page i could not layout = ~/views/layout.cshtml , ~ didn't get expanded. invalidoperationexception: the layout view '~/views/layout.cshtml' could not be located then i copied views/layout.cshtml to views/shared/layout.cshtml. reference by layout = layout . i still got except same as first bullet. invalidoperationexception: renderbody has not been called for the page then i changed renderbodyasync to renderbody , then it worked. then i went back to layout = ../layout.cshtml and removed all rendersectionasync and change d renderbodyasync to renderbody . it worked too. so there are two issues here. ~ not expanded and renderbodyasync was not working in custom controller layout view. i am not sure whether it is mvc or orchard, or i missed something... thanks!
