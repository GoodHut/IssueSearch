 URL : "https://github.com/Shougo/neosnippet.vim/issues/379" TITLE : weird snippet behaviour BODY : trawling through the documents i can't seem to work out why the below snippet doesn't work as desired. my issues are: 1. the first placeholder doesn't work, presumably because of my use of the '\' character. i've tried '\\' and it gives the same result. 2. the indentation for the method public function is non existant. snippet test <?php namespace tests\${1:feature}; use tests\testcase; use illuminate\foundation\testing\withoutmiddleware; use illuminate\foundation\testing\databasemigrations; use illuminate\foundation\testing\databasetransactions; class ${2}test extends testcase { ${3:use databasemigrations, databasetransactions;} / @test / public function ${4} { ${0} } } other than this snippet, everything works perfectly. i've shifted from snipmate to this last night.
