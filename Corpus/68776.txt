BODY : i found an example using your library to get screen capture data, but while it seems to follow all of your function calls correctly, i couldn't figure out why it isn't working. could you try running the code and verify that either i'm using the library incorrectly or the library isn't working as expected? code here: https://autohotkey.com/board/topic/91585-screen-capture-using-only-ahk-no-3rd-party-software-required/ i'm triggering pbitmap := gdip_bitmapfromscreen savefileto := folderpath filename gdip_savebitmaptofile pbitmap, savefileto gdip_disposeimage pbitmap but no image file is being saved. i don't understand what's not working, i even added debug logging into your functions to ensure they're all executing as expected, and making sure there weren't errors, like this all outputs expected results: sysget, x, 76 sysget, y, 77 sysget, w, 78 sysget, h, 79 fileappend, % debug - x: . x . , y: . y . , w: . w . , h: . h . n , log.txt so really no idea why it isn't working. i do have gdip dlls on my system lol... windows 10 also, what i'm trying to ultimately do after i get this example code working is loop trough the pixel data of a small region of the screen rather than actually save it to a file, so if you could do me a favor and advise how i would access the actual pixel data rather than format it as an image, that'd be greatly appreciated.
