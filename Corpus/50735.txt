 URL : "https://github.com/solid/solid/issues/130" TITLE : acl for meta resources BODY : hello, i'm currently implementing a solid server in ocaml https://github.com/zoggy/ocaml-solid . from https://github.com/solid/solid-spec/blob/master/content-representation.md metadata , i understand that a client can modify a metadata resource, which is fine. but how are permissions on these metadata defined ? i see two possibilities: - permissions on metadata of resource r are the same as the permissions on r - permissions on metadata of resource r can be different from the permissions on r and so must be explicitely defined in another resource, which can be the same acl resource of another one .meta.acl ? sorry if this is stated somewhere.
