 URL : "https://github.com/controversies-of-science/react-worldviewer-app/issues/78" TITLE : create a resources index BODY : this would be a list of resources that is strictly a list of materials which relate to scientific controversies. for instance, when i pull up electric universe, i should see youtube videos come up. it should be possible to reference these resources elsewhere on the site, but i shouldn't try to implement this just yet. is it possible to feed youtube search term results into my own search results?
