 URL : "https://github.com/jeroenooms/V8/issues/33" TITLE : increase memory limit? BODY : i know node has the --max_old_space_size flag to increase the memory available. i don't know if this is possible in plain v8, particularly this version? but if so, it would be really helpful to be able to set a higher memory limit when you launch a new v8 context in r.
