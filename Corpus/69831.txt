 URL : "https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych-Redux-GUI/issues/118" TITLE : ui component for arrays BODY : some plugins require arrays to be entered. for example, this is a trial definition for the survey-likert plugin: var likert_trial = { type: 'survey-likert', questions: i like vegetables. , i like fruit. , required: true, labels: strongly disagree , disagree , neutral , agree , strongly agree , strongly disagree , disagree , neutral , agree , strongly agree }; this is especially challenging as a ui component given the nested arrays for the labels parameter. for the questions parameter, i think a multi-line textbox makes some sense as a simple ui component. we can treat each line as a separate entry in the array. perhaps this can be the general solution for arrays. we may need to think about some of the survey plugins more carefully, and perhaps even design more custom components for them. perhaps there is some kind of change we can make to the plugin.info method that enables this kind of customization.
