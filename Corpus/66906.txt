 URL : "https://github.com/webeks/octobercms-imageking/issues/3" TITLE : not working as expected BODY : i was expecting some plugin to add watermark to blog images. for the first time loading, it took ages to load images from a post, and images were loaded with the watermark successfully. i have not checked the source code yet, but i guess it was creating new images that with watermarks. however, when i refreshed the page actually any page , the watermark was gone forever. pretty wierd.
