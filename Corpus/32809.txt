 URL : "https://github.com/rodneyrehm/viewport-units-buggyfill/issues/80" TITLE : wrap in the module? BODY : i do not use the package manager to store the connected resources, but i use gulp to build the project. apparently, because of the above strict mode , the string } this, function { was replaced with } undefined, function { and everything broke. i wrapped all the contents in an anonymous module function { ... } , this solved the problem. be it worth adding your file so that its behavior can not be broken outside?
