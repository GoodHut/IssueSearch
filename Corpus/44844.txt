 URL : "https://github.com/benlau/ihatecontentfarms/issues/31" TITLE : fork for telegram bot BODY : thanks for the brilliant plugin helped me over the past years. i have forked and used the site.js and created a bot for the telegram messenger. i would like to get your permission before distributing it, although it is still in very early development stage. due to telegram api's restriction, the bot is not allowed to edit or delete any message other than its own. i will keep monitoring for any future changes. source code gplv3 : siutsin/ihatecontentfarms-telegram-bot https://github.com/siutsin/ihatecontentfarms-telegram-bot bot: https://t.me/content_farm_bot https://t.me/content_farm_bot <img width= 601 alt= screen shot 2017-01-31 at 11 08 38 pm src= https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/904442/22470593/c5687aae-e80a-11e6-9057-b4808b07a741.png > <img width= 602 alt= screen shot 2017-01-31 at 11 03 38 pm src= https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/904442/22470603/cfb04a78-e80a-11e6-9ed2-b96a061df3c7.png >
