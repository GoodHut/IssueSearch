 URL : "https://github.com/Burke-Lauenroth-Lab/SOILWAT2/issues/15" TITLE : reformat co2 code BODY : there is inconsistent tabbing and spacing in many of the c files, as i had to switch editors half-way through developing and didn't realize the settings were different, and the existing code also had inconsistent sections. before soilwat_co2_effects is merged, tabbing and spacing should be made consistent.
