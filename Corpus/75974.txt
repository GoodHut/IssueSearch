 URL : "https://github.com/adsabs/bumblebee/issues/1261" TITLE : improve build efficiency BODY : the build process could be more streamlined. minify external libraries and only copy necessary code currently copying over everything, including their tests/docs/etc. only final minified/compiled code/styles needs to be in the dist. we are currently including backups and old full source dist should only have what's necessary.
