 URL : "https://github.com/babel/minify/issues/666" TITLE : running cli when no tty BODY : i'm trying to convert my existing babel with preset commands on gitlab pages ci to the new minify , but am running into problems because there's no tty on the docker runner the ci uses. i find a related issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ci-multi-runner/issues/2115 note_22926183 which states that 'there is no tty with gitlab ci'. this means that process.stdin.istty is always false see simple test https://gitlab.com/probins/testtty/-/jobs/29327772 , and cli.js runs runstdin which fails because there are file params. i can for the moment continue to use babel /preset, but i think it would be better if minify could handle this situation, perhaps by adding an option to bypass the tty check if running in this sort of environment?
