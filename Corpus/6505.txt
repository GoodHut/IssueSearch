 URL : "https://github.com/lyfeyaj/swipe/issues/58" TITLE : add rtl support BODY : hey, great work in the original project making this small and useful tool, exactly what i need! also great job maintaining and keeping this alive, thanks! i'm working on an rtl website and after setting up swipe i can't see anything. changing to <html dir= ltr > make it work. also adding dir= ltr to the swipe container. first is of course impossible, and the second is sub-optimal since the direction of sliding is the opposite. i went over the code to see if it's an easy fix but it seems a couple of hours work at least for me to get all the calculations right. is there a plan to add a setting for direction?
