 URL : "https://github.com/Seravo/wp-palvelu-vagrant/issues/38" TITLE : compare to vvv BODY : compare our seravo vagrant box to the develop branch of the official wordpress vagrant box: https://github.com/varying-vagrant-vagrants/vvv if there are any developer tools, speed optimizations etc cool things, consider copying them over to our image. note however to keep the php/nginx part in parity with our production environment, there should be no surprises when developers push their sites to production.
