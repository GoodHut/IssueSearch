 URL : "https://github.com/Mottie/Keyboard/issues/555" TITLE : replace label on key BODY : is there any way to replace the label on a character key with an image? i'm trying to create a classical hebrew keyboard, and some of the vowel characters are so small that they are almost impossible to view in any reasonable font size. so for some of those characters, i would like to display a small image on the key button instead of the actual character. is this possible with the current code?
