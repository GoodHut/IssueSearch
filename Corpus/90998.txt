 URL : "https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/687" TITLE : support for search scopes BODY : one feature that i think would be very useful for searching source code files is the ability to search within scopes . for example, there might be a comments scope which would restrict the search to single- and multi-line comments. another possible scope could be literals to search within string and numeric literals.
