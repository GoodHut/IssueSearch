 URL : "https://github.com/symless/synergy-core/issues/6219" TITLE : synergy stop button BODY : operating systems server: ubuntu 17.10 client: ubuntu 17.10 synergy version 2.0.2 enhancement request it doesn't seem like there is a way through the ui to disable the synergy synchronization. for example, i only want to share the mouse and keyboard when i'm in the office. but when i'm not in the office, my mouse and keyboard are still capable of being shared because my desktop machine has a public static ip . with synergy 1.x, i was able to click stop until i was in the office again, and then i could click start . could we have that functionality somewhere?
