 URL : "https://github.com/layerware/hugsql/issues/60" TITLE : sqlite insert or ignore BODY : i'm using hugsql with luminus and sqlite as the database. i have the following query in a sql file: -- :name get-current-aggregate-version :returning-execute :one -- :doc retrieve the current version of an aggregate root insert or ignore into aggregates values :aggregate-id, 0 ; select version from aggregates where aggregateid = :aggregate-id when i execute the query, i get the following error: arrayindexoutofboundsexception 1 org.sqlite.core.corepreparedstatement.batch corepreparedstatement.java:110 i'm probably doing something wrong, but as i'm rather new to hugsql i have some difficulties in figuring this out. i might also try to execute the query first and the insert second if the query yields an empty result . but i would rather try to understand what i'm doing wrong here. many thanks in advance for the help.
