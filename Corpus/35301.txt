 URL : "https://github.com/andypohl/build-chtc/issues/3" TITLE : docker for travis-ci BODY : use a personal htcondor docker image based on rhel6 with similar specs to a chtc execute node. might need to gather up some data on things installed. things i'm thinking about include: - old gcc installed. - openssl libraries and other libs might not be new. probable strategy: 1. make a new docker image based on centos:6. 2. make an andypohl/htcondor branch extending that image instead of the default centos:6.
