 URL : "https://github.com/NoCheatPlus/Issues/issues/441" TITLE : add staff notify command BODY : this is a suggestion. be able to run a command like '/ncp notifystaff player failed check ' that will act like a normal logging notify message but be able to run it as a command. it's very similar to the '/ncp notify' command but this will notify players with the notify permission. this would allow more opportunities with the command. thanks
