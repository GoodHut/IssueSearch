 URL : "https://github.com/ku-fpg/data-reify/issues/7" TITLE : reify multiple structures BODY : hi, i'm working with cyclic dataflow graphs that can possibly have multiple outputs, and would like to reify them all at once so that the different trees share the same node labels. problem is: right now, i can only reify the subgraphs corresponding to each output independently, resulting in different labels for the same nodes. i think a solution would be to add the following function to data-reify: haskell reifygraphs :: muref s, traversable t => t s -> io t graph deref s would there be some interest in a pull request ? at first glance, it looks like it should be pretty trivial to implement, but perhaps am i missing something. gaÃ«l
