 URL : "https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/issues/4396" TITLE : stm32: can reset BODY : description - type: bug --------------------------------------------------------------- bug target stm32 device not important toolchain: arm a call to reset triggers the can peripheral reset bit, however the peripheral itself seems to set the sleep bit when this happens. this means that can cannot be used after a call to reset without manually clearing the sleep bit in the mcr register can_mcr_sleep which the user has no easy way of doing. should can_reset be changed to clear the sleep bit after the reset? cc @thomasonw
