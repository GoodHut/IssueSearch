 URL : "https://github.com/roger-/pyrtlsdr/issues/65" TITLE : issue with mac book pro BODY : i have got a new mac book pro and pyrtlsdr fails to work. after trying your previous suggestion: import ctypes from ctypes.util import find_library file_name = find_library 'rtlsdr' dll = ctypes.cdll.loadlibrary file_name print dll print dll.rtlsdr_get_device_count , the following resulted: <cdll '/usr/local/lib/librtlsdr.dylib', handle 100600ab0 at 0x1022a1780> <_funcptr object at 0x102239a70>, which seems to be the expected result. however, when i try to instantiate the class, i get: error code -1, when opening sdr device_index=0 . this also happen with other device numbers. any hint of what can be wrong? thank you in advance.
