you can help us change this situation by implementing this one. ref 417 the guide implement an exercise from specification https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/master/you-can-help/implement-an-exercise-from-specification.md will help you succeed. if you still have questions, i encourage you to ask them before starting working on the issue. i also suggest claiming the issue by creating an empty pr as stated here https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/master/you-can-help/implement-an-exercise-from-specification.md avoiding-duplicate-work please note that there are some special 'closing issue' keywords https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/ that you can put in description of your pr and github will take care of closing the corresponding issue automatically after merge.
this simple thing helps us a lot, and makes our life a bit easier
