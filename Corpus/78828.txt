 URL : "https://github.com/github/opensource.guide/issues/391" TITLE : remove blank search page BODY : the xml sitemap links to this blank page: https://opensource.guide/search not a huge deal, but not great for seo, either. @bkeepers i can just remove this file https://github.com/github/opensource.guide/blob/gh-pages/search.html , right? since we don't have a search functionality right now?
