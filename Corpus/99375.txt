 URL : "https://github.com/sinso/docker-piwik/issues/17" TITLE : missing field in log_visit BODY : after setting up the initial database, the field location_provider in the table log_visit is missing. a workaround is to add the field with the following query: alter table log_visit add column location_provider varchar 100 null after custom_var_v5; it would be better to fix this by ether bump the version to the current release or add it to the entrypoint.sh.
