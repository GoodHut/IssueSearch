 URL : "https://github.com/Manuel83/craftbeerpi/issues/182" TITLE : hop additions and more BODY : great project i have it for several days and i love it so much. it would be great to add signal buzzer, or visual during the boil for the hops additions/ irish moss/ spices - according to the beerxml file. another optional variation is to make hops dropper - like this https://github.com/vitotai/lazysusan but it needs to be adapted to raspberry and maybe to optimise it to perform commands coming from the cbpi. i wish i had the knowledge to do it by myself.
