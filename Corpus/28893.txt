 URL : "https://github.com/layagyasz/OpenPanzerBlitz/issues/13" TITLE : implement air units BODY : air units do not fit very well within the current model because - they have infinite movement - they have their own crt when defending including a new result: damaged - enemy aa units get an option to respond after the attack is declared, but before it is executed maybe this can be resolved by giving aa units a stand-by order on their turn? - they have multiple weapons usually 2 - their weapons have a limited number of uses - they have a spotting range
