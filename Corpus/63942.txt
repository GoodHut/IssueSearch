 URL : "https://github.com/k0shk0sh/FastHub/issues/744" TITLE : fasthub crashes nexus 7 BODY : i have a very weird issue. installed the latest version on both my phone motorola moto x, android 6.0.1, cyanogenmod 13 and my large tablet bq aqaris m10 fhd, android 6.0.1, stock rooted with no problems. installing from google play store on my old nexus 7 android 5.1.1, cyanogenmod 12.1 worked. but now, every time i open my home screen trebuchet, default cyanogenmod launcher , it immediately crashes before i can open any app, rendering my tablet completely unusable. i also tried it using nova launcher with the same result. i then tried uninstalling via the settings app, but even the package installer app crashes. uninstalling via the play store worked fine though and resolved all the issues. i could reproduce it by reinstalling. i guess this sounds as weird to you as it does to me, but maybe you have a starting point for me to debug and find out more details.
