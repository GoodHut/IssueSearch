 URL : "https://github.com/domoticz/Reacticz/issues/20" TITLE : add door lock support? BODY : i noticed that my door locks were not supported, but door contacts are. after a quick look at code and domoticz, is seems that if you make a small change to devicewidget.js you could at least display the status of the door lock, even though you couldn't control it. around line 65, change case 'contact' : case 'door contact' : return <contactwidget label={device.name} value={device.nvalue} to case 'contact' : case 'door contact' : case 'door lock' : return <contactwidget label={device.name} value={device.nvalue}
