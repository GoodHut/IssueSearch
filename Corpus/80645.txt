 URL : "https://github.com/vaughanknight/RadialControllerUnityBridge/issues/2" TITLE : unity prefabs being lost BODY : when opening the demo scene all the prefabs and scripts are missing. think your setting in unity are incorrect for use with git. go to editor settings off the edit menu and change asset serialization from mixed to forced text to fix the issue. then push again and it should all work! thanks james
