 URL : "https://github.com/FAC10/week5-SoFLY-newsfeedAPI/issues/45" TITLE : project brief checklist BODY : - use at least 1 api - make your api calls from the back-end using the request module or one you build yourself - your server should contain a minimum of 2 routes - we expect back-end testing using tape test as many components as you can and basic front-end testing. - test your server by injecting fake http requests using shot. - host your project on heroku, see resources - use module.exports and require to break a single large server file into smaller modules. - consider a good server file structure based on what we have discussed over the week. - employ continuous integration on your project with travis or a similar tool. - use codecov or a similar tool for test coverage. - display continuous integration and code coverage badges on your project readme. - ensure that errors are handled, if for example a user attempts to make a request to a non-existent route to your server, provide the user with a custom response.
