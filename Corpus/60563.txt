 URL : "https://github.com/forcedotcom/LightningTestingService/issues/18" TITLE : accessing inherited dom BODY : i'm testing a component that manages a date input field, which extends a base input component that handles the common aspects of an input, so label, error display etc. my initial test was simply to verify that the label i'd passed the component on creation was being applied correctly. the label is a regular html <label/> element, with an aura:id to make it accessible from the component, and is present in the base component. i've followed the approach in the examples and dynamically created the date component, but when i try to verify the label, component.find always returns null. if i move the label into the date component, the find works correctly and retrieves the label. initially i thought this might be down to the locker service although i'd expect to be able to access everything in my namespace , but having downgraded all components to api 39 i still see the same behaviour. is there something around the way that components are created for testing that isolates them from even the base components that they extend?
