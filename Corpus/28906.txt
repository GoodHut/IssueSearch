 URL : "https://github.com/Mirantis/virtlet/issues/347" TITLE : implement proper gc BODY : currently virtlet may leave leftover volumes, domains and nocloud iso files after virtlet restart fix to be applied shortly under variety of conditions, including non-clean node shutdown, manual virtlet pod removal with partial data cleanup e.g. virtlet bolt database is removed but domain data is not , or an unexpected termination of virtlet process. this may lead to hard drive space exhaustion and it's non-obvious how the operator should clean these objects. i suggest the following scheme: introduce naming conventions for domains and volumes, e.g. virtlet- prefix, so in case in some future scenario someone's using virtlet with an external libvirtd non-virtlet objects aren't touched by gc. during gc, we need to find the virtlet- objects that are not in virtlet db and remove them. the gc should run upon virtlet startup and then invoked on periodic basis. we need to take care not to introduce any race conditions here such as gcing freshly created domains that aren't added to boltdb yet
