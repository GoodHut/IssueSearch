 URL : "https://github.com/Esri/ArcREST/issues/323" TITLE : create replica fs problem BODY : arcrest or arcresthelper version or date of download 1/19/2017 v3.5.9 bug or enhancement create_replica_fs.py i created an empty copy of the arcgis online feature and was able to create a replica, but the original will not let me download it. i believe the script fails due to the large size of the data or a timeout with the request. i am unsure how to fix the script to deal with this problem, but our feature has attachments and we wish to be able to automate creating a file geodatabase for local use and as a backup. alternately, if there was a way to automate the sync to get all the new features collected by the field crew into a replica gdb, that would work too. repo steps or enhancement details
