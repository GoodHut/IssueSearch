 URL : "https://github.com/jonrh/react-native-hugecharts/issues/4" TITLE : update from es5 to es2017 BODY : currently the code is written in javascript version es5 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ecmascript 5th_edition . the task is to rewrite and adapt it to es2017. the changes aren't that major, mostly switching out var keywords for let and const and going for arrow functions where appropriate. since this library is only used in an react native environment there shouldn't be any need to bundle or transpile since react native has that all built in and taken care of. long term i'd want to do typescript but this will be a potential minor stepping stone until then.
