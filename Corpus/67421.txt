 URL : "https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-collector-pysmart/issues/20" TITLE : plugin name consistency BODY : collector-pysmart currently uses 3 different names: - pysmart - name of github repo and also name of built aci release - smartmon - namespace name of metrics returned by plugin - smartmoncollector-py - name of plugin given to snap during loading we should choose one plugin name and stick to it - inconsistent names may cause problems and confusion. i propose changing both name seen by snap and namespace to just pysmart to indicate that it's a python plugin collecting s.m.a.r.t. metrics and preserve compatibility with repo name.
