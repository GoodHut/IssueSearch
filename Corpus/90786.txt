 URL : "https://github.com/skelterjohn/go.wde/issues/54" TITLE : stop on os x not stopping BODY : i'm running the following on os x high sierra: package main import fmt github.com/skelterjohn/go.wde _ github.com/skelterjohn/go.wde/cocoa time func main { go func { select { case <-time.after 2 time.second : fmt.printf stopping wde.stop } } wde.run fmt.printf run finished } this prints stopping , but never run finished , so it seems that stop isn't making run return. is there anything i can do to fix this?
