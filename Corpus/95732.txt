 URL : "https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/issues/476" TITLE : disable nginx default host BODY : hey, just installed mailcow and everything works so far. however, i would like to disable the display of the mailcow login page, when accessing a domain that points to the server, where mailcow is running. i've set up mailcow with the domain mail.domain.tld, but i also see the login page when opening the server ip for example. i could modify the index.php in /mailcow-dockerized/data/web, but i guess, that's not how it should be done.
