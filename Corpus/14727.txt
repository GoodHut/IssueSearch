 URL : "https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/10902" TITLE : c compression api BODY : i can't seem to find any extensive documentation on how to setup message compression using c . the only reference to compression i can find is in the file: grpc/src/csharp/grpc.core/writeoptions.cs however it's not clear what setting this variable does! is there a way to setup compression on both client side requests and server responses using c ?
