 URL : "https://github.com/TI-Tokyo/riak-community-admin/issues/3" TITLE : eligibility for pg votes BODY : the proposed requirements to vote on project direction group - end users are stated as: all companies supporting the project through resources or financing this opens the possibility for abuse and cluttering. abuse of this rule can happen by a bad actor creating many micro supports and gaining voiting rights. cluttering can happen over time as only a single support action has to be taken for gaining a indefinite voting right, this will mean that we might need to contact companies or individuals that are no longer active or interested in the community. i would propose two restrictions: 1 a minimum 'amount' of support 2 a time limit as in within the prior period
