 URL : "https://github.com/cmb69/browserupdate_xh/issues/2" TITLE : looking for new maintainer BODY : i don't have the time to develop or even maintain this plugin further, so a new maintainer would be welcome. of course, anybody interested could just fork the repo and continue development, but i'd rather link to the new home of the plugin from here as well as from the project page http://3-magi.net/?cmsimple_xh/browserupdate_xh , and i'm open to discuss licensing issues, and whatever may need clarification or change.
