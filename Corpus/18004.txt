 URL : "https://github.com/cleanflight/cleanflight-configurator/issues/488" TITLE : serial port usage BODY : currently, i have a simple python script that opens a serial port, runs a couple of functions, and then closes the port. import serial ser = serial.serial '/dev/ttyusb0' print ser.name example function ser.close however, after i run this script, cleanflight-configurator is not able to successfully establish a connection on on /dev/ttyusb0 . the log shows serial port successfully opened with id: 2 and then timeouts after 10 seconds with serial port successfully closed . as of now, the only way to actually establish a connection after running that script is to fully reboot the computer. why is cleanflight unable to reopen a serial port?
