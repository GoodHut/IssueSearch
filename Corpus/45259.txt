 URL : "https://github.com/dib-lab/sourmash/issues/296" TITLE : how does gather work? BODY : looking into the code for sourmash gather i built the following intuition about how it works algorithmically, and would like to know if i am correct: given a query and a database, it finds the best match. then, the corresponding hashes/ k-mers are removed from the query and we repeat this until either no query is left or no matches are found. does this mean that if two organisms have more or less identical copies of x % of their genome such as closely related strains , gather will report only one of the strains and not the other? thanks.
