 URL : "https://github.com/wpsmartcrop/wpsmartcrop/issues/3" TITLE : custom thumbnail sizes BODY : i've just installed your plugin and it works as intended when using the default thumbnail sizes. when i change the thumbnail name to one of my custom ones, the plugin won't append any classes to the image and because of that it won't work as expected. is there anything that i should do to make it work or this is a real issue?
