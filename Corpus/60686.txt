 URL : "https://github.com/th0r/webpack-bundle-analyzer/issues/113" TITLE : add brotli size support BODY : this is a discussion issue to add brotli size support on the report, side by side with gzip. on the app we support, 78% of users surf the web with a brotli-enabled browser. global support is around 60%. see http://caniuse.com/ search=brotli also, in our tests, brotli grants 10% more compression than gzip. we are developing a angular cli, angular 4+ app. i will be experimenting with a fork to add brotli by replicating the gzip size implementation. any suggestion and feedback is welcome.
