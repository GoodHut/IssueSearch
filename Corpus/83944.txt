 URL : "https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/issues/154" TITLE : configurable project name BODY : i realize, both from looking at privatebin installs https://github.com/privatebin/privatebin/wiki/privatebin-directory and from discussions online https://www.reddit.com/r/privacytoolsio/comments/5kdf6x/privatebin_11_released_added_italian_and_russian/dbpsmbq/ , that many installs change the project name. at the moment they either have to change the template or change all the translations containing the term. both of which takes some effort to repeat every time you want to update the software. i think that the configuration file would be an appropriate place to keep such changes in, as the project name usually isn't translated anyways and the configuration file will not be affected due to upgrading the project. we deliberately keep the default config file separate https://github.com/privatebin/privatebin/blob/master/cfg/conf.ini.sample as to not overwrite any actual conf.ini file on upgrades.
