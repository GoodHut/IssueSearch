 URL : "https://github.com/xodio/xod/issues/768" TITLE : untangle patch container BODY : rationale after introduction of new editor modes resizing, panning, etc , patch container became quite messy. we have to check for current mode in almost every event handler and keep a lot of state that is used for a single mode. patch code should be split into chunks that explicitly describe how events should be handled for each editor mode, what should be rendered, and rules for switching to other modes. something like state machine. also, see discussion in 729 affected modules and packages xod-client
