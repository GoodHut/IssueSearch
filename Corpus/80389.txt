 URL : "https://github.com/pricingassistant/mrq/issues/189" TITLE : track releases in github BODY : i noticed the releases on github are not in sync with the releases on pypy. it would be less confusing, if there was a new tag on github pointing to the head commit of the release every time a release is deployed to pypy.
