hi, my mail address was recently changed, and i changed it on the page http://lauraceae.myspecies.info/user/2/edit as well. now i noticed that i still get mails from scratchpads via the old address. at the moment it is still kept as an alias, but that will not be the case indefinitely. do i need to change it in some other place as well?
