 URL : "https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf/issues/3569" TITLE : setting default font-size BODY : i'd like to know if it's possible to change the default font-size. it would be really useful as i'm trying to use bootstrap 4 which uses rem units by default for all the typography titles, headers, paragraphs, etc... but that heavily relies on the base font-size which is usually set to 16px. i'd like to be able to specify another default font-size as being the default one in hope that rem units would pick it up . i found by searching that qt had an option for that in qwebsettings.defaultfontsize but it doesn't seem available through the wkhtmltopdf library.... is there a specific reason why? thanks in advance!
