 URL : "https://github.com/Financial-Times/next-video-editor/issues/67" TITLE : improve db seeding BODY : we have a mongo dump to seed a dev database with make mongo-seed but integrating this into the unit tests 65 proved too difficult for me as the seed uses several mongo-specific json extensions to describe types, formats etc. in the end i created a standard json seed for test purposes. the problem is that maintaining _both_ is of course, a pain.
