 URL : "https://github.com/haskell/haddock/issues/618" TITLE : rst markup for haddock BODY : i would really really like it if i could write haskell api documentation with restructuredtext rst . it's great for writing python documentation, and would allow me to be consistent between my api docs and higher-level docs i notice that haddock uses rst for its docs . haddock markup is idiosyncratic, and unlike markup used elsewhere. it's hard to guess, and i always find myself consulting the manual. i realise this is a big request, and that there are equally valid arguments for markdown or other markup languages. i'd love to implement it myself, but step 0 is filing a bug here.
