 URL : "https://github.com/cmangos/tbc-db/issues/74" TITLE : quest the attack! BODY : this was fixed by xsavior spelling? while it was implemented almost 100% perfectly for some reason marzon the silent blade is not flagged to attack-able when lord gregor lescovar is, thus the quest is not able to be complete as you can't kill the mob. i can see in the file that he is changed to faction 7 just like lord gregor but still isnt attackable for some odd reason.
