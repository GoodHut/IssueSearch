 URL : "https://github.com/NatLibFi/voyager-http-api/issues/1" TITLE : implement rate limiting BODY : implement rate limiting because voyager will spawn loads of keyservers if there many numerous record writes. rate limiting allows limiting number of write requests from one ip during the specified time window. if the number of requests is exceeded within the time window http response code 429 _too many requests_ is sent. rate limiting is off by default. the following options must be defined for rate limiting to be enabled: - ratelimit.window : number of milliseconds representing the time window. requests originating from the same ip will be limited if their number exceeds the specified limit during the time window. - ratelimit.requests : maximum number of requests allowed within the time window express.js middleware rate-limit https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-rate-limit is used to implement this feature. example configuration maximum of 100 request in one minute js { port : 1337, initfile : c:/foo/bar/voyager.ini , externalurl : https://foo.bar/vger , fetchapi : https://fetch.foo.bar , ratelimit : { requests : 100, window : 60000 } }
