 URL : "https://github.com/DevHeap/collatz_conjecture/issues/14" TITLE : calculation speed control BODY : implement additional client -> server message field to control calculation speed: client slider to control, sending the speed update message server control calc delay via channel instead of hardcoding it message i think that the easiest way to manage it in the protocol will be to extend the start message and make both of it's fields optional: json { seed: _start_number_, speed: _speed_in_percents_ } and then when this message is accepted, start the calculation if seed is provided in the message, or configure speed if speed is the only field in the message. when there is only seed , fall back to default speed. percents may be mapped to the reversed delay range defined in server code or config file. @aljutor what do you think?
