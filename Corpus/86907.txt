 URL : "https://github.com/ananthamurthy/eyeBlinkBehaviour/issues/17" TITLE : incorporate session types BODY : to keep it simple, we need to implement the following logic if sessiontype_ind == 0 tracetime = 0; posttime = 1400; // to allow for all trials of all different session types to have the same length else if sessiontype_ind == 1 tracetime = 250; posttime = 1150; else if sessiontype_ind == 2 tracetime = 350; posttime = 1050; else if sessiontype_ind == 3 tracetime = 500; posttime = 900; else //default tracetime = 250; posttime = 1150; the posttime refers to the end of the air-puff us to the end of the trial. this can be modulated as required. the idea is the have the same trial duration, independent of the session type. please edit variable names as required.
