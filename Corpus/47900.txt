 URL : "https://github.com/Aubron/scoreshots-templates/issues/130" TITLE : ragin cajuns, preview BODY : requested by: ragin cajuns, jeff schneider public use template description: this is a preview template for basketball. they do not own the original design, so we'll need to alter it a bit, but they like the general style of it. they also are not requesting this be specifically branded to them, so we can share it. i don't see anything super worrying about this one, but the cajuns will probably want to tweak the color of the lower colored area, so a solid, unchangable png on top of the template probably isn't the right solution. you might have to play with this a bit. they'd like it to be usable by november 28th. dynamic considerations: n/a currently additional materials ! 3 notre dame next up https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26412274/32570916-c0384b5c-c493-11e7-865a-00c021db3879.jpg
