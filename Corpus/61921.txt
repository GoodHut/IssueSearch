 URL : "https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/7145" TITLE : c and pre-build scripts BODY : i have c project which runs powershell script before building. it just updates version number and it's not needed. i tried to override it in .yml with: - alias powershell= exit 0 and - echo -e !/bin/bash exit 0 > $pwd/powershell and - echo -e !/bin/bash exit 0 > $home/powershell and - echo -e !/bin/bash exit 0 > $travis_build_dir/powershell but i always got something like: /tmp/tmp435c3310.tmp: 1: /tmp/tmp435c3310.tmp: powershell: not found. so i fixed it with removing pre-build events: - sudo apt install xmlstarlet - echo removing pre-build events.. - find $travis_build_dir -type f -iname .csproj -exec sh -c 'xmlstarlet ed --inplace -d /_:project/_:propertygroup/_:prebuildevent 1 /.. {} ' \; - nuget restore project.sln is there other way?
