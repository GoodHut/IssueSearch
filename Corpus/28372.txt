 URL : "https://github.com/rajeshincorp/UD_SendDtmfToneOverActiveCall/issues/1" TITLE : friper.in not exist BODY : i just imported your code in my studio , but i am unable to resolve the iincalladapter class as i am not able to download the java class from your given link http://friper.in/apis/incalladapter.java also as you mentioned in the work flow :- when you will launch the app you will be landed to a page where you can enter a phone number and can press call button to make a phone call. pressing call button will launch default incall app or telephone app that will make the phone call for you. immediately the incall app will go into the background and our custom dialer will appear on the screen. now you will be able to use this custom dialer to send dtmf tone over the active phone call in the background. that's it. so, we can divide the project into two parts 1 sending the call into the background ---- achieved. 2 sending the dtmf tone over an active call ---- not achieved yet . :- is this achieved in this demo now ? please help me out , as i have exactly same requirement as you listed in your workflow. thanks
