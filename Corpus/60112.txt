 URL : "https://github.com/unitycontainer/container/issues/32" TITLE : where did teardown go? BODY : i just tried to update from v4.x to v5.1.2 and noticed that the unitycontainer.teardown method along with the pre- and postteardown code in the unitycontainerextension is missing. i use these for cleaning up container created instances and their dependencies with a custom object tracker. are you planing to put such a feature in the container itself like other containers did for a long time ? will the code come back?
