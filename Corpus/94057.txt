 URL : "https://github.com/BestImageViewer/geeqie/issues/503" TITLE : better sorting, like ls -v BODY : i have files from 1.jpg to 12.jpg. they are sorted like this be geeqie: 10.jpg, 11.jpg, 12.jpg, 2.jpg, ..., 9.jpg. if i issue an ls -v command in the terminal uses so called version compare i get my personal favorite ordering of 1.jpg, 2.jpg, ..., 9.jpg, 10.jpg, 11.jpg, 12.jpg. this ordering would improve usability for me to a great degree and maybe for others. i'm quite sure that the current ordering would not be missed. geeqie 1.2.2, ubuntu 16.04
