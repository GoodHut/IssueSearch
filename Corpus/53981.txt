 URL : "https://github.com/FreeRDP/Remmina/issues/1270" TITLE : fatal frequent crashes BODY : we support remmina 1.2+ versions only. please do not report bugs occurring on older versions! please give us some details about the systems you are using: client os name and version : fedora21 remmina version remmina --version : 1.2.0 desktop environment gnome, unity, kde, .. : mate connecting to os and version : server 2003 connecting via rdp, vnc, ... : rdp rdp issues only, freerdp version xfreerdp --version : 2.0.0 this problem is very serious in use, it exits frequently in use, it appears once in a few minutes, the message is prompted when exiting： errinfo_decrypt_failed 0x00001192 : a decryption using standard rdp security mechanisms section 5.3.6 failed. b session key creation using standard rdp security mechanisms section 5.3.5 failed. frequently exited so that it can not be used normally, although we need to use it frequently. i found a quick way to reproduce: after the remote desktop connection shakes the mouse without any other operation note that only the cursor movement, less than a minute will quit, i suspect that there is a relationship with the mouse. i do not know if other people have encountered this phenomenon, i think this problem is an urgent solution, i try to solve did not find a suitable solution obviously this error message is derived from freerdp，have the same problem in freerdp: https://github.com/freerdp/freerdp/issues/433
