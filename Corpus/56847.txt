 URL : "https://github.com/blocktrail/blocktrail-sdk-php/issues/80" TITLE : optimal fee is too big BODY : optimal fee for transaction about 380 bytes about 0.001+, sometimes even more, according to https://bitcoinfees.21.co it should be about 380 140 = ~0.0005... but low priority fee is really low and it takes a lot of hours to process, can you fix it or we'll need to calculate fee manually to avoid overspending?
