 URL : "https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16277" TITLE : remote state output BODY : the existing https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/output.html terraform output command allows to retrieve outputs from terraform state files. when using a remote backend such as s3 i would like to do something like this: terraform output \ -backend=s3 -backend-path=/my/s3/path/terraform.tfstate my-output right now this is possible by initialising terraform for one backend and then call terraform output my-output and then switch to another backend. is this easier by using workspaces or is this not intended to get implemented anytime soon?
