 URL : "https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/issues/254" TITLE : db timeout / crash BODY : we just started trying out bors-ng internally running our own instance , and we're getting some errors like this: 21:05:39.123 error postgrex.protocol pid<0.306.0> disconnected: dbconnection.connectionerror client pid<0.3011.0> timed out because it checked out the connection for longer than 15000ms 21:05:39.124 error genserver pid<0.3011.0> terminating dbconnection.connectionerror tcp recv: closed db_connection lib/db_connection.ex:794: dbconnection.transaction/3 bors_worker lib/batcher.ex:66: borsng.worker.batcher.handle_cast/2 stdlib gen_server.erl:601: :gen_server.try_dispatch/4 stdlib gen_server.erl:667: :gen_server.handle_msg/5 stdlib proc_lib.erl:247: :proc_lib.init_p_do_apply/3 last message: {: $gen_cast , {:cancel_all}} they seem to be causing batches to be cancelled or marked crash . from what i can understand, the code is doing something in a transaction and the transaction is running longer than 15 seconds so it's being timed out; i couldn't grok the code well enough to figure out exactly what it's doing in handle_cast though. is there some easy way to work around this? i'm not sure if this is the consequence of being 300ms+ away from github making stuff slow, or some local issue.
