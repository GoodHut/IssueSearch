 URL : "https://github.com/klinker24/Android-Blur-Launcher/issues/19" TITLE : improve tablet layout BODY : tablets have the search bar, and the app drawer, full screen. i really hate the way this looks, it would be better to just open them on the middle part of the screen, with some padding around them. or, when 15 is done, we won't have to worry about the search bar, just the app drawer.
