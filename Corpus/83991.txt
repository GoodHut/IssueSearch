 URL : "https://github.com/Pingry-Java/MazeSolver/issues/9" TITLE : consolidate node classes? BODY : looks like no one has used the wall class or any node s other than maze square . let's decide to do exactly one of the following. 1. start abstracting details of various types of nodes into proper subclasses 2. change the api so node is a concrete class probably implemented as mazesquare currently is and remove the wall and mazesquare classes.
