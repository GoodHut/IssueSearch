 URL : "https://github.com/rfcs/crypto-conditions/issues/30" TITLE : rsa salt length BODY : i recently started trying the rfc test vectors again against my implementation. the rfc mentions asn1 rsassa-pss-sha256-params rsassa-pss-params ::= { hashalgorithm sha256identifier, maskgenalgorithm mgf1sha256identifier, saltlength 20, trailerfield 1 } however, for me, my implementation fails the rsa vectors for salt length 20, but succeeds them for salt length 32.
