 URL : "https://github.com/InteractiveMechanics/CollegeWomen_Drupal7/issues/15" TITLE : x blog post update error BODY : from evan i just tried to edit the two most recent posts to include bylines mount holyoke college for the most recent and smith college for the one before that . both times i went to edit the post, added the byline, and clicked save, and got this error message: { command : settings , settings :{ basepath : \/ , pathprefix : , ajaxpagestate :{ theme : sisters , theme_token : z8xb_hzvdhpu-dssvvfp2nxpnkog41cfae7ox7xzhns }}, merge :true} update from evan actually, it looks like the update did take effect and the bylines now appear. i guess it wasn't an error message after all, but just code. can we fix it so that that doesn't appear, and the user is instead rerouted to the find content page?
