 URL : "https://github.com/metafizzy/isotope/issues/1310" TITLE : fitrows is being ignored BODY : hi there, i'm experiencing a weird issue. first: i'm using wordpress with the woffice theme. for the news/blog section i've selected masonary layout three column . i requested a code to past in the custom code section of the theme in order to horizantally sort the news items. some months back i received this code: jquery body.page-template-blog .masonry-layout, body.home .masonry-layout .isotope { // options itemselector: '.box.blog-item', layoutmode: 'fitrows' } ; with the last update it stopped working. when the page loads, it does get arranged as it was with this workaround. but, when the page is completely working it goes back to the original masonary layout. it looks like this custom code is being loaded and lateron being ignored? does someone have a clue how i can fix this? many thanks!
