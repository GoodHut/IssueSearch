 URL : "https://github.com/harrisiirak/cron-parser/issues/91" TITLE : not incrementing interval BODY : i saw this should have been fixed in version 1.1.1, so i upgraded till latest version 2.3.1 . but still failing and not in the second iteration, but in the first this is the source code: var next; try { next = cronparser.parseexpression task.repeat .next .tostring ; if task.name == 'bidqueue' { console.log repeat: + task.repeat ; console.log now: + new date ; console.log next1: + next ; } next = new date next ; if task.name == 'bidqueue' console.log next2: + next ; } catch e { console.error 'error setting up cron job ' + task.name + ' .', e.message || e ; return alias; } and this is the output: _repeat: now: tue feb 21 2017 16:45:00 gmt+0100 cet next1: tue feb 21 2017 16:45:00 gmt+0100 next2: tue feb 21 2017 16:45:00 gmt+0100 cet _ as you see, next1 and next2 should have been incremented in 1 minute, but the time is the same as now
