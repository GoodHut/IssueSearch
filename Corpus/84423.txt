 URL : "https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk-script/issues/1837" TITLE : custom extensions loading BODY : this issue tracks the work to address 1586, 1419 and 1395 from a runtime perspective, this feature is mostly supported by two major items: extensions management api - a new host api will be exposed, allowing clients primarily the portal to add, remove and list extensions - this api will handle the restore process when handled by the host - the host will trigger a publish for the artifacts - a custom build tool will process the output and generate an extensions metadata file extensions.json , containing references to the extension types, with assembly hints, also pushing the binaries to the bin folder in the function app's root. runtime/extension loading - the runtime will not perform extensions installation as part of initialization or normal execution. that will all be handled by the aforementioned api - the runtime will check for the presence of the extensions.json file in the bin folder in the function app's root, if present, the references will be loaded and initialized as custom extensions.
