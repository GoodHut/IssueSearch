 URL : "https://github.com/gcarq/inox-patchset/issues/63" TITLE : no access to most files? BODY : i'm trying to install extensions. when i try to load unpacked files, the file picker won't show me most folders in my home directory. if i drag and drop it, the browser will say the file can't be found. i figured the browser doesn't have permission to read those files but i've checked and the user that starts the inox process can rwx all of these. for reference, i'm on arch linux.
