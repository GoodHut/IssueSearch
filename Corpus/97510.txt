 URL : "https://github.com/bkeepers/PRobot/issues/77" TITLE : handle organization events BODY : probot currently only dispatches webhook events that have a repository in the payload. there are several events like organization https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/ organizationevent , membership https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/ membershipevent , and team https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/ teamevent that aren't associated with an organization. @migaro and i talked briefly about this, and one option for events without a repository is to look for a repo named something like probot-scripts in the organization, and evaluate the configuration from that repository.
