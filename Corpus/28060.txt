 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/issues/1746" TITLE : external test data? BODY : i'm preparing a pr and want to run a comprehensive test suite, so i thought i would try python testdriver.py run -t nightly many of the tests fail because they expect an environment variable cntk_external_testdata_source_directory to be defined. i can't any instructions on how to create and populate this directory however. also the wiki states: note: some tests require an environment variable named cntk_external_testdata_source_directory pointing to where the data resides. if the external data is not available those tests will be skipped. however under linux these tests fail rather then being skipped.
