 URL : "https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Mono/issues/23" TITLE : question about the code BODY : i read some code without debugging because of none ros developing experience, and have some question: 1. it seems that the program can be divided into 2 parts: feature_tracker and vins_estimator and if i compile the whole program, i can get 2 executable file. in my view, vins_estimator is used for the whole estimating procedure, and the features of image are supplied by feature_tracker, is it right? 2. the estimator_node is the 'start point' of vins_estimator, and it will start the thread 'process' which is used to collect imu and image data and process them, at the same time the program can receive and store imu and image data from ros , is it right? 3. loop closure initialization procedure is carried out in 'process'. if the second latest frame is keyframe, then marginalize the oldest frame, if not, then marginalize the frame. but i don't know the meaning of variable 'keyframe_freq' and why the keyframe should be added every 3 times in the loop? ! http://images2015.cnblogs.com/blog/1158108/201706/1158108-20170613181459931-1158767414.png 4.will vins have none ros version or already have like orb-slam, so more developer can modify it more easily?
