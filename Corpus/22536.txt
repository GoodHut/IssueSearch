 URL : "https://github.com/Vladimir37/Backlun/issues/15" TITLE : local import paths BODY : the import paths in backlun.go and possibly in other files as well, i did not look further are local. suggestion: change the imports to include the github path e.g., import github.com/vladimir37/backlun/back/blackjack to make the project go get table. btw, building from a downloaded zip file, as advised in the readme, is not an option. unzipping the files somewhere and running go build fails because go searches the import paths relative to $gopath/src . even unzipping into $gopath/src would not help, as the top-level folder in the zip file is named backlun-master where go build would expect it to be just backlun .
