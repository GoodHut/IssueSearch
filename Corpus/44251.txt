 URL : "https://github.com/KAIST-IS521/TeamOne/issues/75" TITLE : error in build script BODY : hi, this is ta examining your team project. please solve the following issue. db/makefile trieggers setup_mysql.sh first, and then executes sudo pip3 install pymysql . however, setup_mysql.sh internally runs python3 reg_ .py scripts, which depends on pymysql library. this raises error when building your project in pure docker image. thanks you.
