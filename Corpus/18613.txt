 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26299" TITLE : ts server crashes BODY : - vscode version: 1.12.1 - os version: macos 10.12.4 16e195 the project is private so i can't share the code or steps to reproduce it though i'm going to provide some logs, hopefully will be enough. if you need something else please ask. the file that i open is about 1100 lines and it's a pure typescript file that is importing some of lodash , d3 and angular v4 . as soon as i open this file ts server crashes and nothing will work anymore! ts server restarts but it gets stuck at binding forever, and the only to get code to work is restarting. this issue started right after updating to 1.12 here is the ts server log file https://pastebin.com/7pslxsgc here is the chromedevtools console http://i65.tinypic.com/1z4ki20.png
