 URL : "https://github.com/marcalwestf/adaxaFinReports/issues/48" TITLE : include changing the role BODY : right now, if a user wants to change a role, she has to log out and do the log in procedure anew. with the available changes from the adaxa repo in a commit by sachin https://sourceforge.net/p/adempiere/contribution-adaxa/ci/75dff0c36725 the role can be changed on-the-fly without needing to log in again: only the role has to be selected. a new session has to be created and the context correctly replaced. this is useful and saves time for users who have to work with different roles and switch constantly back and forth. comparing these changes to adempiere repo, there is little to add, because some changes needed are already implemented. this is only for zk; for swing it would be necessary an additional development.
