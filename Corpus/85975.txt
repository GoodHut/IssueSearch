 URL : "https://github.com/machour/yii2-notifications/issues/38" TITLE : generic fix for oracle db BODY : for more compatibility of the extension can tell you some fix needed for oracle database: - in the matching of boolean value we must use 1/0 because in oracle boolean doesn't exist. the migration tool convert an attribute set as $this->boolean in numer 1,0 36 ref. issue 36 - i have ovverride the notify function also because for oracle the expression now doesn't exist, so first i replaced it with sysdate that is suited for oracle but i can suggest you to use new expression 'current_timestamp' . - in the migration i also need to change created_at attribute from datetime to date because datetime is converted into timestamp and the models return a datetime like this 18-lug-17 17:53:09,000000 , it is possible to have timestamp with precision 0 in oracle that returns 18-lug-17 17:53:09 but i have not figured out how to set precision 0 in the migration $this->datetime 0 doesn't work glad if this can help improve compatibiliy of the extension.
