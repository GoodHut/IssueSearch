 URL : "https://github.com/TDesjardins/gwt-ol3/issues/89" TITLE : bing maps support? BODY : is there a reason gwt-ol3 does not provide wrappers for bing maps supported in ol ? https://openlayers.org/en/latest/apidoc/ol.source.bingmaps.html i've created a patch, basicaly just two additional simple jsinterop wrappers: ol.source.bingmaps extends ol.source.tileimage and ol.source.bingmapsoptions extends ol.source.tileimageoptions it works and if there are no issues that i'm not aware of license? i can provide a pull request.
