 URL : "https://github.com/somdoron/AsyncIO/issues/17" TITLE : possible memory leak? BODY : i encountered a possible memory leak after running asyncio on an environment where connection resets or disconnections happen frequently. i tried with some code to reproduce the problem and observed that the memory usage kept raising after full gc. the code could be downloaded here: consoleapp1.zip https://github.com/somdoron/asyncio/files/1297699/consoleapp1.zip run the code and it will keep creating servers and clients connecting each other and then closing the connections. the memory usage will be print on the console. ....................................................................................................finished mem used after gc:152916 ....................................................................................................finished mem used after gc:182100 ....................................................................................................finished mem used after gc:205268 ....................................................................................................finished mem used after gc:215696 if you have _process explorer_ https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer , please double click the consoleapp1.exe process listed on it and take a look at the _gen 2 heap size_ from the _.net performance_ tab in the process properties dialog. you will see that the gen 2 heap size keep raising while the program runs.
