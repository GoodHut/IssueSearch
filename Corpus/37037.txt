 URL : "https://github.com/defaultnamehere/verylegit.link/issues/1" TITLE : issues with brackets BODY : hi, a+ tool, will use again. i just wanted to report a difficulty with some links. for example, i created: http://click.here.to.get.ripped.in.three.weeks.verylegit.link/0x8c paypal 985iphone botnet$torrent.jar.dmg.docm which is a link to: pusheen.com however, if i send this link to someone on facebook, facebook's url parser assumes that the url stops at the bracket, and sends my friend a broken link. you can see a similar issue if i try to use markdown and share this link here: click here http://click.here.to.get.ripped.in.three.weeks.verylegit.link/0x8c paypal 985iphone botnet$torrent.jar.dmg.docm could i recommend pulling brackets from the output?
