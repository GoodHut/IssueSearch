 URL : "https://github.com/brad-cannell/myFunctions/issues/2" TITLE : create a freqs function BODY : i'm thinking it will be called in the context of dplyr: 1. given a grouped tibble and called inside summarise 2. it will return the n, percent, and 95% confidence interval options will include 1. changing the percent of the confidence interval 2. number of decimal places displayed should also work easily over multiple columns - perhaps using summarise_each
