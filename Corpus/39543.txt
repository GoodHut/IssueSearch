 URL : "https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot-containers/issues/693" TITLE : signed addon release BODY : hey @groovecoder, @clouserw alerted me to the fact that we need a release before august 8th of the addon that is signed with our special key. we could do this already and ship the 2 bugs that we patched, the assignment bug is really irritating me for tab orders anyway. so worst case scenario we can keep working without shipping the huge sdk patch and just bump the version number. just wanted to file this for traceability.
