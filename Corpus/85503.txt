 URL : "https://github.com/ncw/rclone/issues/1465" TITLE : feature mediafire support BODY : using v1.36 on archlinux x86_64. i use google drive and dropbox with rclone but it's missing support for mediafire. long time ago i thought mf would become one of those download sites that make you wait for a long time and show popups but was proven wrong - it's actually a full featured file hosting service. being able to access it from rclone would be really convenient.
