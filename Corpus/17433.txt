 URL : "https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile/issues/20" TITLE : phase 3: encoding BODY : this issue is to track overall discussion on the next phase of development for this library: encoding. the previous phases were phase 1 enumerations 2 and phase 2 decoding 3 landed in mapbox-gl-native in https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9312 ðŸŽ‰ . the primary goals for the encoding implementation are: - high performance / minimal overhead / low to zero allocation - headers are modular and able to be used in a zero cost way you don't get any extra dependencies than absolutely required for a given header - e.g. no dependency on geometry.hpp or variant unless the header absolutely needs it - api is low-level like protozero. downstream developers will be able to easily abstract on top of it be be able to integrate into libraries like mapnik-vector-tile / tippecanoe. roles - @joto will lead development of design over next 3 weeks july 3-21 - @flippmoke will support, test, advise on viability of api for integration downstream /cc @mapbox/core-tech
