 URL : "https://github.com/certego/fw1-loggrabber/issues/33" TITLE : possible memory leak BODY : hi, i launch fw1-loggrabber in a docker container to pull firewall flow logs. the container crashs after approximatively 24 hours because the process fw1-loggrabber consumed all the memory available and the kernel kill it oom killer . the virtual machine used to launch the docker container has 2 gb of ram. i see the fw1-loggrabber process memory consumption grows linearly. i also launch another docker container in the same docker host to pull firewall audit logs. this container doesn't crash. it consumes only 2 mb of ram. should i have more memory available in my virtual machine ? if yes, how much memory ? if no, it seems to be a memory leak : . can you help me please ? thanks. gabriel machado.
