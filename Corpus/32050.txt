 URL : "https://github.com/mbojan/alluvial/issues/35" TITLE : titles for alluvial BODY : the two functions plot their elements differently, and the title parameter is only available in alluvial_ts . is there a specific reason that titles haven't been implemented for alluvial ? i want to respond to this question on so http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43130418/set-colors-title-in-an-alluvial-plot , and i was going to suggest using mtext in tandem with the ylim_offset parameter. but it would be straightforward to add a title parameter or maybe main , but that would be inconsistent with alluvial_ts and pass it to the main parameter in the plot call, so i'm checking to see if that would be desirable. sound good?
