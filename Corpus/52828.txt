 URL : "https://github.com/MikeSalisbury/eventbright/issues/8" TITLE : create event form bugs BODY : there are several bugs with the create event form that should be addressed: - currently, the event registration form redirects me back to the same page when there are errors. - i shouldn't be able to go to the create event page if i'm not signed in. - bug: uploading the image sometimes tries to submit the form. - upon successful event creation, redirect to the index page or ideally, the new event show page. optional notes - maybe show that it's optional for event type and event topic. - real website has both publish and make event live button, but i think for yours it might be nice to just have the bottom button. less confusing.
