 URL : "https://github.com/jpillora/cloud-torrent/issues/172" TITLE : limit maxmum fd usage BODY : hi all, i tried cloud-torrent these days, it's really great, but a problem is when download some torrents, there seem some fd leaks, /proc/pid/fd/ gradually increase to 1024, then the program crash.. some openvz vps could not change maximum fd, so is it possible to limit fd by the program itself? thanks
