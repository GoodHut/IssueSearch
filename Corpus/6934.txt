 URL : "https://github.com/reactjs/react-modal/issues/314" TITLE : close on escape BODY : summary: just the standard modal closes when user hits the escape key . steps to reproduce: 1. make a modal 2. open it 3. hit escape expected behavior: the modal closes additional notes: i've been reading through the issues here and this functionality seems to have gone from always on , to dependent on the presence of onrequestclose to non-existent. it'd be really nice and i think would make everyone happy if one could just do: <reactmodal closeonescape={true/false} />
