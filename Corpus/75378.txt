 URL : "https://github.com/ArcticaProject/nx-libs/issues/568" TITLE : hardcoded path in nxcomp BODY : from nxcomp/loop.cpp : const char systemenv = getenv nx_system ; if systemenv == null || systemenv == '\0' { nxinfo << loop: warning! no environment for nx_system. << std::flush; systemenv = /usr/nx ; } and from nxcomp/misc.cpp : nx_system the directory where nx programs and libraries reside. \ if not set, the value is assumed to be '/usr/nx'. \ programs, libraries and data files are respectedly \ searched in the 'bin', 'lib' and 'share' subdirecto- \ ries. \ -> we should replace the hardcoded path during compilation.
