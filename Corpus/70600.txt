BODY : i'm a rookie and attempting to follow the instructions to get this project working on my computer for my ergodox. i've obviously missed something, but can't tell what. i’ve downloaded and installed mhv avr tools, mingw, and qmk zip. i’ve followed all the steps to the best of my skills on a win 7 box, and ran the two setup batch scripts. the driver install failed, so i did that install directly using the included driver installation .exe and it reports success. when i attempt to run make from the command prompt, it reports failures of date.exe and dies, then fails to run cmp.exe probably trying to report on success/failure. so, it sounds like i have make in my path, but several things are missing. i’ll try to figure out what they are at my next opportunity. i ran win_check.bat and will attach the output win_check_output.txt https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/files/948348/win_check_output.txt
