 URL : "https://github.com/unpoly/unpoly/issues/22" TITLE : use of eval BODY : added unpoly directly to my bundler however it is failing minification due to use of eval in multiple scopes, thus it is not able to minimize properly. the eval's are all of the form of: javascript knife: eval typeof knife !== undefined && knife !== null ? knife.point : void 0 , 8 of them specifically. there is no knife defined anywhere in the output code nor does the knife in the returned object seem to be used anywhere in the output code. it does not seem to be referenced in the documentation anywhere either. what is the point of knife or knife in the dist code as it does not seem to be used in any form, and could it be removed in the distributed code as the eval 's are wrecking havoc with minification.
