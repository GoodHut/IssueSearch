 URL : "https://github.com/gridcoin/Gridcoin-Research/issues/238" TITLE : define development process BODY : while the new master+development strategy caused the wallet development to really take off, it also made it a bit ad-hoc pretty quick. we now have a lot of new functionality and fixes in the development branch but very little has been done in terms of large scale testing. it could be a good idea to define some sort of process. i haven't given this much thought and it might be too rigid for continuous development, but something along the lines of: - after a release we try to define what we want to include in the next release. open prs, issues, new functions etc. - we mostly me try to avoid feature creep and non scheduled refactoring or fixes unless it's important enough or required to proceed. - when the scheduled fixes have implemented we merge development to staging. - staging only receives bugfixes from now on. any fixes done in staging is merged to development. - when we feel staging is stable enough we merge it to master and tag a new release. but, as i said, it can't get too rigid. we still want a way to merge pull requests without having them go stale for a month. we might need another branch strategy for this. i'll keep thinking about it.
