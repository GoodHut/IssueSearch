 URL : "https://github.com/shashwatak/satellite-js/issues/40" TITLE : drop bower support BODY : i think that we should drop bower support probably, after version 1.4.0 release of satellite.js as it seems deprecated: $ npm install -g bower npm warn deprecated bower@1.8.2: ...psst! your project can stop working at any moment because its dependencies can change. prevent this by migrating to yarn: https://bower.io/blog/2017/how-to-migrate-away-from-bower/ /home/ezze/.nvm/versions/node/v6.11.0/bin/bower -> /home/ezze/.nvm/versions/node/v6.11.0/lib/node_modules/bower/bin/bower /home/ezze/.nvm/versions/node/v6.11.0/lib └── bower@1.8.2 the same depreaction warning is placed on bower home page https://bower.io/ and bower github repo https://github.com/bower/bower there is also an issue https://github.com/bower/bower/issues/2298 . if anybody still uses bower package of satellite.js consider switching to yarn https://yarnpkg.com or npm https://www.npmjs.com/ . another reason to drop bower support is the following: anytime we change the source code of the library we should rebuild everything in dist directory including minified file which introduces a big diff even if a change was small. dropping bower we can exclude built files in dist from the repo.
