 URL : "https://github.com/tidusjar/Ombi/issues/1810" TITLE : question sonarr caching BODY : hello just wondering if ombi can cache downloaded episodes from sonarr instead of checking plex/emby i don't use plex or emby but kodi with an ftp server so for my setup any show downloaded in sonarr/radarr is what's available in kodi. it would be cool if ombi changes the processing request to completed automatically by caching downloaded episodes from these sources :+1: or maybe it already does i haven't checked to be honest i've just installed this soft and it looks like emby and plex are necessary to run it ^^
