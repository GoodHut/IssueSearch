 URL : "https://github.com/square/flow/issues/255" TITLE : the purpose of multikey BODY : hi. i am trying to implement a fairly complicated navigation in my app using flow. in my app i have several sequential screens, they are nested one in another just like in treekey example . it is simple if my understanding of treekey is correct. but why does getparentkey always return a new instance of parent key rather than get its instance from the constructor, is it a limitation of a state restoring process? the complicated part is that every screen can have several different slave screens just like in master\slave case , they are just like childfragments from pure android. slave screens can replace each other with complicated rules and animations and the slave container should have its own backstack, but when the master screen goes out or is destroyed slaves should be hidden or destroyed as well. should i use multikey for this purpose? or should i use nested flow instances not sure that it is possible ?
