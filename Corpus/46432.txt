 URL : "https://github.com/filipalac/240pTestSuite-PS1/issues/1" TITLE : many thanks for this! BODY : this port is already helping nicely with my other work. it's great to have the psx and ps2! available for image quality tests. to make this issue worth it, here's a couple notes: - on the ps2, button inputs are somewhat delayed, but the suite does work. - the scroll test has an odd flicker on some of the background details. you probably noticed. - it'd be great to have all the typical horizontal resolutions, at least in some of the tests. it would be most useful in the colorbleed and checkerboard patterns to me, at least . thanks again! :
