 URL : "https://github.com/zeromq/jeromq/issues/410" TITLE : push/pull blocking nature BODY : i'm having a issue regarding the blocking nature of push/pull sockets. here is a gist https://gist.github.com/pdoro/f70de75aee9e2c51d56654b273693ee0 with an example. i've made a slight variation of taskvent where the dispatcher sends 15k messages each one about 500b size to a push socket. the workers 2 in my gist receive the message from their own pull socket, then they sleep for 2msec and finally forward the message to the collector. the collector just receives the messages and signals the dispatcher to finish with a req/rep socket. in my example, the collector never receives all the messages but if i decrease the message size to say 50b then all the messages arrive to the collector. from the zmq documentation, push/pull sockets block messages when their hwm are reached and the kernel buffers are full. i expect all the messages to arrive to the collector no matter the size of the message. obviously, larger messages should trigger hwm limits sooner, but not block indefinitely the stream. this situation may be related with 379, 314 or 355 note that altough i'm using threads for the example, the push/pull sockets are not shared between them.
