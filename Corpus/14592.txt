- there is no attach files option - when i add a new page a menu item in the main menu is created by default. this will result in an inundation with links quite fast, so i think the default should be different. - except for the menu item i have no way to see my new page. it doesn't pop up on the front page, it doesn't pop up under 'articles'.
