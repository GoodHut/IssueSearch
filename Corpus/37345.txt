 URL : "https://github.com/nbellezza/.github.io/issues/5" TITLE : lots of css chaining BODY : i'm seeing a lot of really chained css selectors. sometimes this is necessary, but it prevents the styling from being reusable. try to simplify your selectors a little, only chain what you need to chain. would featured img { } accomplish the same thing? https://github.com/nbellezza/.github.io/blob/master/resources/css/style.css l88
