 URL : "https://github.com/MapWindow/MapWinGIS/issues/15" TITLE : utf-8 encoded labels BODY : i just posted same query on codeplex - reposting here as i am unsure if that forum is active. apologies for duplication. i see here evidence of unicode support in labels here https://mapwindow.atlassian.net/browse/mwgis-13 ; however we cannot get them displayed properly on a map. we would like to know the current support and limitations for utf-8 encoded labels in mapwingis 4.9.4.2. thanks in advance.
