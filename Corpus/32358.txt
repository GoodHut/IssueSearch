 URL : "https://github.com/sequelize/cli/issues/482" TITLE : update the skeleton BODY : hello, since es6 is now supported in the lts version of node for a while except imports . i think it might be a good idea to update the skeletons generated by the cli. or give the ability to the user to override them. any thoughts ?
