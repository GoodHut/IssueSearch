 URL : "https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-native/issues/1416" TITLE : secure storage api BODY : i'm currently using the secure storage plugin. to me it seems like the api is a little inconsistent with the securestorage cordova plugin. the cordova plugin is only able to store and retrieve strings. hence i believe that the ionic plugin should be return a promise<string> rather than a promise<any> whenever a get is called.
