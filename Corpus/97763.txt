 URL : "https://github.com/pr-omethe-us/PyKED/issues/38" TITLE : how to handle yaml imports BODY : pyyaml is back from the dead, so let's figure out the best way to handle the yaml parsing libraries. there are three options: 1. pyyaml the official implementation, slightly outdated, but back from the dead 2. ruamel.yaml the updated implementation 3. ruamel_yaml conda-only package of the updated ruamel library it would be nice to pick one and standardize on it. we have chosen ruamel.yaml so far, but there is apparently a bug with it and pylint found in this build failure: https://travis-ci.org/pr-omethe-us/pyked/jobs/205693652 so i propose we switch to pyyaml for a few reasons 1. the build failure 2. pyyaml isn't dead anymore 3. confusion between ruamel_yaml and ruamel.yaml 4. pyyaml is the official implementation
