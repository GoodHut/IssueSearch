 URL : "https://github.com/otm/svg.path.js/issues/20" TITLE : update broken BODY : the update method has weird logic see below . moreover, it does not return this , as suggested in the documentation. if you want to keep setter and getter merged, you could test for arguments.length === 0 to return the property and this otherwise. javascript update: function redraw { if redraw === true this._redrawenabled = false; if redraw === false this._redrawenabled = true; return !!this._redrawenabled; }, this simplifies to this._redrawenabled = !redraw , which seems wrong.
