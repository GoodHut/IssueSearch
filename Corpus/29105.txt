BODY : to try and geta grip on this issue, i used the liblo tools, to find out how we could control ardour on the second machine. for example, to stop the moving playhead: oscsend osc.udp://192.168.1.xxx:3819 /transport_stop these instructionsare according to the ardour manual: http://manual.ardour.org/using-control-surfaces/controlling-ardour-with-osc/ after numerous attempts i found out that in csound stops the playhead of ardour with: oscsend 1, 192.168.1.xxx , 3819, /transport_stop , i , 1 instead of oscsend 1, 192.168.1.xxx , 3819, /transport_stop that i was expecting because of the oscsend util. i am aware of the recent change to oscsend to have the type as well as the value optional. i'm on linux mint, --csound version 6.10.1 double samples dec 23 2017.
