 URL : "https://github.com/pka/t-rex/issues/15" TITLE : bbox for generating tiles BODY : hi! great tool! we try to generate pbf tiles for only the netherlands and just a few zoom levels. when using t_rex generate it will always generate tiles for the whole world/gridset and has to start at zoom level 0. is it possible to include settings for a bounding box and zoom levels for which it will generate the tiles in? or would it be possible to add these variables? like for example in tl copy from https://github.com/mojodna/tl -z 6 -z 8 -b -124.4096 32.5343 -114.1308 42.0095 thanks!
