 URL : "https://github.com/indiehosters/piwik/issues/23" TITLE : no access through web BODY : hi, i ran your command list from the readme, i.e.: git clone https://github.com/indiehosters/piwik.git cd piwik mysql_root_password=mystrongpassword docker-compose up but there's no access through the web. i'm wondering if there are dependencies or other steps that haven't been listed in the readme...
