 URL : "https://github.com/qizhex/RACE_AR_baselines/issues/1" TITLE : performance of the model BODY : hi, i tried to use the stanford attentive reader on the data, testing the pretrained model via bash test_sar.sh . i downloaded both the glove embeddings, which i put under data/embedding , and the race data, under data/data . however, the resulting accuracy on both development and test data is only around .36-.39, and not > .4, as stated in the paper. there is no error message as far as i can tell, the output of the script is appended. any idea about what could have gone wrong? looking forward to an answer! log.txt https://github.com/qizhex/race_ar_baselines/files/1548096/log.txt
