 URL : "https://github.com/vvvv/SVG/issues/322" TITLE : examples - suggestion BODY : i dare to make a suggestion. create more, more samples ! this library is very useful for many people. it took a lot of work to complete many svg features, but it is very, very hard to begin to use it because there are not any samples - i mean functionally c /vb.net little projects with some little graphics creations. it is very useful that exists projects to convert a svg to png or to open an svg in a picturebox. that project that draw a circle is very useful, too. it is the base for me, but still is very little... those features in the existing samples are less then 1% from the amount of features of the library. it is very hard, for a beginner with svg, to found out all the features. for me, i need to look at the source code to understand what the library is builded and how to i could achieve some basic functions. it took a day to understand how to use a svgpath. so, it would be very useful and constructive to have some basic, simple examples for: - svgpath, svgpathbasedelement, svgimage and all others basic elements - clipping and masking i've tried to clip something, but not succeded - filter effects - animation - any events or at least mouse events - path segments, builder, painting, transforms. for people like me is hard to create such basic samples, but for someone who knows very well the library i guess that it will took very little time. and the time is profited because there are less questions, more bug discoverers, more users and so more help in difficult tasks. thank you anyway !
