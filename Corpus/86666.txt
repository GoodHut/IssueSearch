i have a suggestion that is in the back of my head for a rather long time.
what about having something like a planning mode in the app? implemented as a checkbox like the show archived option. if selected, the days-timeline of each habit, where you normally select a habit as done for the past days, will also expand to the future. now, maybe with a new ui-gesture like fast double clicking , one could make the selection of a habit in the future possible. the selection has no implication, just visually shows what has to be done at that day. if that selection is not actively marked as done in the old style if the future day becomes today, it is just deleted at midnight. if a new gesture is implemented, one could also allow this to be done on today even without planning mode switched on . in the morning one could mark things to be done today.
hope this is understandable : if not, just ask, i will clarify. have a nice day you all.
