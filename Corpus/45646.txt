_originally opened as https://github.com/ncpn/upland/issues/29_ ---- the tally buttons on the fuels fsub_fuels_ld , 1-m belt shrubs fsub_lp_belt_shrub , and 1-m belt seedlings fsub_lp_seedling forms could be improved. the user must ensure that the cursor is in the correct field in order for the tallies to work properly. if there is a touch-based solution available in the future, that would be worth checking out.
