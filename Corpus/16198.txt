 URL : "https://github.com/ummjackson/mastodon-guide/issues/20" TITLE : https not working BODY : i followed your guide after i found the official documentation to be missing a few steps, and i have everything mostly working. the only thing i cannot figure out is why my https is not working. when i visit the root of the domain https://ultrix.me/ , it shows an error in my browser. visiting port 3000 http://ultrix.me:3000/ works, but it is only using http. any ideas?
