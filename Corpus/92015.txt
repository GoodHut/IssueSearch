 URL : "https://github.com/raerose01/deconstructSigs/issues/20" TITLE : use with non-human genome BODY : hi, it's not clear to me whether setting the bsg option to another genome in mut.to.sigs.input e.g. mut.to.sigs.input bsg=bsgenome.dmelanogaster.ucsc.dm6 is sufficient to apply the correct normalisation in whichsignatures tri.counts.method = 'genome' . your readme says: included with the package are tri.counts.exome, which contains the trinucleotide counts for an exome and tri.counts.genome, which contains the trinucleotide counts for the hg19 genome does this change if we supply a different genome? or will it always normalise to counts in hg19? thanks, nick
