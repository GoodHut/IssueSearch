 URL : "https://github.com/cakephp/debug_kit/issues/496" TITLE : afterdispatch no firing BODY : this is a weird issue i am facing with debugkit. it used to work before, but i am not sure when and why did it stop working. after debugging the plugin itself i came to find out that afterdispatch was not firing for debugkit. if i change 'priority' => 9999, to 'priority' => 1, in the following method, then debugkit works fine. public function implementedevents { return 'dispatcher.beforedispatch' => 'callable' => 'beforedispatch', 'priority' => 0, , 'dispatcher.afterdispatch' => 'callable' => 'afterdispatch', 'priority' => 9999, , ; } for now, i will keep this change, but i was wondering if anyone can point me to a fix.
