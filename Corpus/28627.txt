 URL : "https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-inner-buildpack/issues/6" TITLE : heroku build number BODY : hi there, thanks for creating this build pack. really appreciate the effort and would be stuck without it. i'm wondering if there's some way of using this to expose the heroku deployment number to our react app? is it held in an environment var or as part of the build artefacts?
