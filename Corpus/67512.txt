 URL : "https://github.com/snowleopard/hadrian/issues/440" TITLE : preparing for the merge BODY : so, it looks like hadrian is finally getting merged! ðŸŽ‰ the plan is to merge hadrian as is, without yet recommending ghc developers to switch to it, but already requiring all ghc patches to be buildable both by make and by hadrian. let's use this issue to keep track of what needs to be done. - fix all references to github issues and pull requests in the source from n to concrete github links to avoid confusion with ghc tickets. - prepare the patch, using git subtree feature to keep hadrian repository here. anything else?
