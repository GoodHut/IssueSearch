 URL : "https://github.com/mdn/interactive-examples/issues/364" TITLE : live-lint js examples BODY : suggested by @thejameskyle in conversation with @chrisdavidmills . when people edit js examples, we could lint them and display any lint errors. > james likes our interactive editor, but said including linting in it would be a useful educational tool - to introduce people to the concept early and often. we'd need to think about how to present errors so people didn't get confused between js errors and lint errors.
