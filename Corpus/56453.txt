 URL : "https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/752" TITLE : need update on jsdom ? BODY : hi, when writing my tests scripts lately, i encountered a problem with jsdom when following the official guide https://nuxtjs.org/guide/development-tools end-to-end-testing . problem is: typeerror: jsdom.createvirutalconsole is not a function. indeed, jsdom does not have a method named createvirtualconsole . i guess it was renamed virtualconsole as one can see here https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom virtual-consoles . so i tried and changed that but then i encountered another error: typeerror: jsdom.env is not a function . maybe nuxt needs an update on this? if so, i think i could do it but it would take some time since i do not completely understand jsdom and i would need to dive into nuxt code.
