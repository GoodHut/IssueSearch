 URL : "https://github.com/chjj/compton/issues/427" TITLE : compton no transparency BODY : i installed arch linux and was dealing with the very end steps to have everything looks fine. i used as recommended compton 1 as a composite windows manager. it worked well initially displaying transparent windows, but after rebooting it stopped working. now, when i start compton i see that the display refresh immediately, then the process keep running, but there is no transparency whatsoever. also it can make the system freeze if i do not run it with '&' and instead try to put it on the background with 'ctrl+z' as i was modifying some other files along the short period where it worked, i would like to know if it can come from this... can it come from .xresources ? i tried a couple of different one. can it come from gtk theme parameters? how can i troubleshoot the issue? 1 : https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/compton
