 URL : "https://github.com/certbot/certbot/issues/5278" TITLE : deprecate python 3.3 BODY : this requires a little research into best practices here, but we should start reporting that our acme module is dropping python 3.3 support using best practices for a library and we should start logging at the warning level in certbot about the same problem. python 3.3 is no longer supported by the cpython and there are no major distros using it. i want this for our next release so we can remove support in the release after that. cc @joohoi and @swartzcr another good target
