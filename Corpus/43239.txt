 URL : "https://github.com/Lycanite/LycanitesMobs/issues/240" TITLE : concapedes are broken BODY : whenever i spawn a concapede, it only spawns as a head and one extra segment. as well as this, all the segments move in a super-stringy manner they even try to place themselves in front of the thing's head , and the head itself just seems to walk sideways and backwards spin around everytime it stops walking.
