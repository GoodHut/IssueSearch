 URL : "https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-rekognition-video-analyzer/issues/11" TITLE : build.py assumes python 2 BODY : although early in the instructions you mention python 2 or python 3, when i got to pynt -l i got an error from build.py i took a quick look and see it that at the very least the print statements are written for python 2 only. are you intending to release a python 3 version of this? i'm bummed because i now have to go back and build a new environment using python 2.
