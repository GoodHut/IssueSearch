 URL : "https://github.com/datafolklabs/cement/issues/469" TITLE : add scrub extension BODY : a lot of times when debugging issues, we ask the end user to provide debug output. unfortunately this often includes info we don't want to include passwords, ip addresses, etc . would be handy to have a scrub extension that can be configured to match content regex in a pre_render hook and replace it: example: python from cement import app class myapp app : class meta: label = 'myapp' extensions = 'scrub' scrub = 'this-is-the-regex', 'this-is-what-it-replaces-with' ,
