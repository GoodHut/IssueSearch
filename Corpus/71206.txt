 URL : "https://github.com/torognes/vsearch/issues/242" TITLE : add --relabel_ids option BODY : when dereplicating, it would be nice to have an option to relabel sequences with the concatenated ids of all original sequences. if not as a sequence id list might be too long , at least as the sequence description. for example, with an input: >11 aaaaa >12 aaaaa give an output e.g. : >11:12 aaaaa cheers,
