 URL : "https://github.com/firefox0102/waterwatch/issues/15" TITLE : admin ui remediation BODY : @firefox0102 here are some items that i was not able to fix. can you take a stab at these? - all pages: a weird double box shadow shows up below main header when smaller widths - mobile nav menus: admin and non-admin sites should have uppercase links blue for default, green active and the light blue hover color seen in select/lists - sign in page: errors showing up at bottom instead of inline shows generic “there was an issue” message can we display validation inline to have then retry email/password? - all date pickers - default date should be today’s date. format mm/dd/yyyy - collection site data page - when click log new data - link should take to log data page but with collection site already populated - collection site data page - first collection date date format in summary and column should be mm/dd/yyyy - collection site data page - do you have bandwidth to display e. coli colored based on levels like we considered? e.g. red=high would need high vs low values from erik - collection site data page - outstanding to dos: ‘view data on nww map’ and ‘view site on google maps’ links - bug! collection site data > edit log data - should not be able to bulk edit site data; also when select one, all are being selected - collection site data - still have todo listed for e. coli and coliform values in table - edit log data - add cancel button and functionality
