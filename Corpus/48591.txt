 URL : "https://github.com/keithmorris/gulp-nunit-runner/issues/23" TITLE : set format of output? BODY : i am currently using the nunit runner for various tests, but some of the specflow ones need to be run through the specflow reporter. problem seems to be that the specflow reporter needs you to do: nunit3-console.exe --labels=all --out=testresult.txt --result=testresult.xml;format=nunit2 bin\debug\bookshop.acceptancetests.dll i cannot find a way to specify the format=nunit2 though, as if i try appending it to the end of the result file: result: api-test-results.xml;format=nunit2 , it just blows up saying unknown result format: nunit2, so is there any way to get this working with the runner? as i would rather use this than directly use command line.
