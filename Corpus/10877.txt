 URL : "https://github.com/react-bootstrap-table/react-bootstrap-table2/issues/90" TITLE : drop bootstrap 3 BODY : hi allen, i suggest that your new version of react-bootstrap-table be pure flexbox, which means supporting only bootstrap 4 and not bootstrap 3. bootstrap 4 is pure flexbox. it's a good idea because supporting two radically different layout engines will end up being a nightmare for you. better to leave react-bootstrap-table version 1 as bootstrap 3, and make react-bootstrap-table version 2 support only bootstrap 4. refer here: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/21389 https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/19901 thanks
