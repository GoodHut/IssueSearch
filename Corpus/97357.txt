BODY : hi, i'm sure i'm doing something wrong, but until now i've spent too many hours for this. when i follow the steps of lab 5, and i start the second noun - word-server step 15 i get only cold words like this: > some sentences blizzard icicle icicle blizzard blizzard. blizzard blizzard blizzard refrigerator blizzard. blizzard blizzard blizzard blizzard blizzard. blizzard blizzard blizzard blizzard blizzard. blizzard blizzard refrigerator blizzard icicle. i guess somehow setting the hard coded string to words, overwrites all running instances which i really don't get . first i had this problem by using the intellij ide, then i downloaded sts and the same problem occurs. could somebody please give me a hint on this one? thanks a lot!
