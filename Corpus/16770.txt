BODY : hi all, using bugfix and when i uncomment > define show_temp_adc_values i don't get any return after issuing m105. in fact, i don't get anything showing in the log in repetier, almost as if i didn't even send anything? no acknowledgement of it being sent, nothing. here is a list of the log while i typed each m code numerically: >16:40:58.686 : echo:debug:info,errors 16:40:58.686 : echo:active extruder: 0 16:42:01.464 : n39 m5 28 16:48:20.757 : n165 m5 36 16:48:25.701 : n168 m16 27 16:48:29.244 : n170 m14 16 16:48:31.487 : n172 m100 38 16:48:35.617 : n174 m101 33 16:48:37.704 : n176 m102 32 16:48:39.735 : n177 m103 32 16:48:41.913 : n179 m104 41 16:48:47.949 : n183 m106 46 it completely skips m105 like i didn't even type it. any ideas? is this an issue on the repetier side as if it's not sending it or the marlin side? i don't know enough about this stuff yet. i'm trying to calibrate my hot end temperature because my fluke thermocouple is telling me i'm ~20 degrees c off from the actual temps. thanks!
