 URL : "https://github.com/mlutfy/hidetopbar/issues/145" TITLE : gnome 3.26 support BODY : does the extension work with gnome 3.26? today i tried it with ubuntu 17.10 and nothing happens after installation. i added 3.26 to the metadata.json file however this doesn't change anything. actually i don't known if i installed the extension correctly. the gnome-shell-extension-tool -e ... seems to accept any string as extension name so i guess it also doesn't verify anything.
