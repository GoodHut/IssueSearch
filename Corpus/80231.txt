 URL : "https://github.com/volkanceylan/Serenity/issues/2296" TITLE : thanks and two questions BODY : hi volkan; million thanks for amazing work and facilities you made available and your support. i am exploring the serenity to get myself acquainted with its nice features. i would like to know how it is set to insert primary key value in foreign key value automatically when inserting data in child/subform. like the orderdetails, when we enter an order details, the orderid is automatically inserted. my second question is about cascade drop down. i found this guide https://volkanceylan.gitbooks.io/serenity-guide/content/howto/how_to_setup_cascaded_editors.html which seems to be for an earlier version. if you have an updated one that would be great. thanks
