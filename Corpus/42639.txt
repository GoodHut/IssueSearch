BODY : i'm having an issue finding points that lie outside a polygon. i thought i could use st_difference for that, but it's returning a geometry set with zero features. is this a bug, or am i misunderstanding st_difference ? r library sf library dplyr nc <- st_read system.file gpkg/nc.gpkg , package = sf , quiet = true %>% st_union a lon/lat point north of nc, near pittsburgh not_nc <- st_sfc st_point c -80, 40 , crs = st_crs nc these two seem right: st_intersects not_nc, nc, sparse = false 1x1 false matrix st_intersection not_nc, nc empty geometry set these four seem wrong: st_difference not_nc, nc empty geometry set st_difference nc, not_nc empty geometry set st_sym_difference nc, not_nc empty geometry set st_union nc, not_nc empty geometry set
