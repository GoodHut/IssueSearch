 URL : "https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/370" TITLE : work with osmimprove.org BODY : hello improveosm.org is an amazing tool to find turn restrictions, oneways, missing roads and so on. it uses metadata from traffic data. i don't know how hard this would be to implement but i'd love to see if your app could work together with improveosm. like this your app could ask questions like is there a turn restriction from raod x to y? maybe with visual support or is this a one-way restricted road? i am not a dev so i can't help with implementing.
