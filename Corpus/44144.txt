 URL : "https://github.com/bitpopulous/alpha/issues/37" TITLE : email alerts borrower BODY : i don't see any field in the borrower's profile that allows me to enter an email id that can be used to receive email alert of impending due payment and overdue payment. unless login email id is to be used for that purpose also. i would suggest that maybe more than one email for receiving of alerts can set for internal company monitoring that go to different people within the organisation.
