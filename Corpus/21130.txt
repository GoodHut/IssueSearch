 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/xaml-standard/issues/54" TITLE : ellipse and shapes BODY : the ellipse control is supported in wpf and uwp but it is not supported in xamarin.forms. when creating custom controls it is useful to have ellipse controls and/or shape controls that are fully functioning. this allows the developers to get a very simple graphic and apply several different styling techniques to it without needed a designer. when i switched over from wpf/uwp to xamarin.forms i found the lack of shapes and especially ellipse a very lacking feature
