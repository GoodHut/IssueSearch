BODY : well, i was afk a while doing some server stuff. i had a fairy pack just beside where my base was, so it was always chunkloaded, after some time i got huge lag when i got outside of my house. and what i saw infront of me was a massive chunk of fairies flying around. had to do /killall @e just to get rid of them, beacuse i did not know what the entity name was. so i died, and when i killed the fairies they dropped tons of fairy dust! many stacks of it. here is an image how horrible it was: ! fairies everywhere http://i.imgur.com/cxsranc.jpg
