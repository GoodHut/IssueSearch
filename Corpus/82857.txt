 URL : "https://github.com/chasecaleb/OverwatchVision/issues/16" TITLE : automate parameter tuning BODY : determining parameters for opencv algorithms e.g. blur radius, threshold level by hand is a pain, time-consuming, and sub-optimal. although this is not a machine learning project, the same approach to hyper-parameter tuning could be used. this would obviously be test/utility code, not shipped. references: - https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/big-datas-biggest-secret-hyperparameter-tuning - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/monte_carlo_method
