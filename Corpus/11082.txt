BODY : so the image library deals with rgb,rgba predominantly , fair enough, would it be possible to use generics/etc to generalise the number of channels 1,2,3,4, and even more, and just happen to have inbuilt accessor names for the rgb,rgba cases. i.e. having one type with a query 'num_channels ' , i.e. you can view the data as being a 3d array that happens to be width x height x channels x channel data type . in some other recent experiments i was sort of wanting to settle on a 4d array i.e. texturearrayslices x width x height x channels and it just happens to be the case that 'texturearrayslices' is usually 1 that could also be volume-texture slices use cases: images with selection masks embedded, cg images with multiple channels embedded specular, normals etc , and using image functionality to deal with the intermediate data in ai-conv-net filters/layers etc i realise that picture 3d/4d array might fall apart a bit if you want to take it in another direction, packed pixels e.g. supporting 565, 1555, 4444 buffers through the same interfaces . there's also weird formats in existence like 7e3 7e3 7e3 etc perhaps i'd be better off making another crate that looks how i describe and just pulls in the decoders/encoders from here or it could have the structure i describe and provide accessors to the slices as 'images' ? .. i haven't looked into the internals here in detail but i'm guessing it needs the image interface for the encoders/decoders to work consistently
