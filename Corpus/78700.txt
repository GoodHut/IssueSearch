 URL : "https://github.com/jupyter/nbgrader/issues/720" TITLE : recent kernelspec update BODY : just fyi, it appears that the new requirement to have kernelspecs in the db invalidates old gradebooks. the error when assigning is: python sqlalchemy.exc.operationalerror: sqlite3.operationalerror no such column: notebook.kernelspec sql: 'select notebook.id as notebook_id, notebook.name as notebook_name, notebook.assignment_id as notebook_assignment_id, notebook.kernelspec as notebook_kernelspec from notebook where ? = notebook.assignment_id order by notebook.name' parameters: 'dd7f27919f4949f086e975671d05579d', for me, i had to modify the gradebook in sqlite3 to get it to work. these are the commands that worked: sql alter table notebook add column kernelspec varchar 1024 ; update notebook set kernelspec='{ display_name : python 3 , name : python3 , language : python }'; where python 3 or python 2 is used as appropriate. just wanted to pass this info on in case anyone else had this issue.
