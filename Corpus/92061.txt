 URL : "https://github.com/acacha/adminlte-laravel/issues/243" TITLE : username instead of email BODY : i have ran the command provided by instructions: php artisan adminlte:username the command was executed successfully and i can see in my auth.php file that 'field' => 'username' the problem is that i still cannot login with a username, the reason is that the username field in database is empty. when registering a new account on the register page, it does not ask for a username to be entered. is this something that i manually need to edit on the register page code?
