 URL : "https://github.com/CompuIves/codesandbox-client/issues/313" TITLE : achieve true hmr BODY : right now, whenever you change a file, the whole sandbox app gets re-evaluated, which re-initialises all app state. it would be very nice to have hmr support with the same api as webpack https://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement.html , so that we can leverage existing hmr loaders for react, vue etc.
