 URL : "https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/issues/961" TITLE : scrolling is often laggy BODY : on ios, when in the message view narrowed to a stream , if i scroll around a bit, the app often doesn't respond to some of my swipes. that is: i touch and swipe to scroll, it starts moving normally; then i touch again and try to swipe either to scroll further or to stop scrolling; and nothing happens, just as if i hadn't touched the screen at all. this behavior is very unusual in my experience as an iphone user might happen very occasionally, but basically no app i've used routinely suffers it , and it sticks out. i imagine what's happening is something like the relevant thread being busy and not responding to the scroll event, but i don't know enough about how the app actually works for that to be more than speculation.
