 URL : "https://github.com/NRGI/resourcecontracts.org/issues/1055" TITLE : back-end annotation bug BODY : sometimes, for no reason, the art. references of an annotation move up to the previous annotation. e.g. here. infrastructure has references of art. 3.1.3 and 8.2. but in the screenshot, those references are given to income tax and infrastructure has references to art. 17, which are actually for the language category, below. ! image https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12913915/23315624/0e068c0a-fa95-11e6-886c-f2ed8728dc59.png this makes it hard to edit and update annotations. i don't think this is a new problem either, though i have encountered more recently.
