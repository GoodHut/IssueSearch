 URL : "https://github.com/wilderborn/partyline/issues/3" TITLE : feature request: log lines BODY : hi, it would be helpful if partyline could log the line to laravel's log when configured to do so . that way, in one partyline:: command we could print the line and save it when the command isn't run by the user but by a cron task . it would be neccesary to map partyline function calls to log , so maybe partyline::line would call log::info , partyline::info would call log::info and so on.
