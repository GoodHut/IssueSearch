 URL : "https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/8541" TITLE : install and testing guide BODY : i was trying to install and test the latest master branch so that i can get started with contributing but i couldn't find any particular install guide. furthermore, i can see lots of tests already included but i have no clue of how to run those. of course, all of these things can be learned by seeing the source code, but will it not be better if there is a seperate install guide and a testing guide which we can link with the contributing guide. ps: i managed to install opencv by reading up on cmakelists.txt and the test suite by looking into travis.yml file. but i strongly believe that this actually acts as an initial barrier for contributing.
