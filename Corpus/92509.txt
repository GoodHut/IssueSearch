 URL : "https://github.com/STScI-JWST/jwst/issues/664" TITLE : xanyan --> v2v3 transform BODY : the output frame for the the distortion models for some instruments is xanyan and not v2v3 as we originally thought. the pipeline needs to add this additional transform. from colin: there has been much confusion over this. some things have been labelled v2v3 when they were really xan,yan. xan,yan is the system the optical modeling software uses. for everything except nirspec the siaf presents results in v2v3 measured in arc-sec. i think miri is cleared up now so far nirspec gives the polynomials in xan,yan degrees. but a recent delivery which you might have seen no evidence of yet gives v2v3 degrees. there is ongoing discussion of how this stuff will be delivered in future. the conversion between is v2 = xan v3 = - v3+d if you are working in degrees d = 0.13. in minutes it is 7.8 and in arc-sec 468 this is exact as it is sort of a definition. and yes, this applies everywhere.
