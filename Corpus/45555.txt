 URL : "https://github.com/jupyterhub/hubshare/issues/6" TITLE : implement storage api BODY : we have a spec, the first thing to do is implement the api. our spec describes a simple rest api, but it may still be worth exploring webdav as the storage api, as described in 2 discussion. it looks like wsgidav https://wsgidav.readthedocs.io would be the way to go for us. we can run wsgi apps in tornado using wsgicontainer. or a multi-process approach, with auth in tornado, proxying to wsgidav via unix socket.
