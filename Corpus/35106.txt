 URL : "https://github.com/sjdirect/abot/issues/168" TITLE : decision maker issue BODY : i'm having an issue that when i crawl my sitemap. abot doesn't crawl my entire pages. i look at crawldecisionmaker and the function shouldrecrawlpage. i saw that if crawledpage.webexception == null return new abot.poco.crawldecision { allow = false, reason = webexception did not occur }; my question is if webexception is null then how webexception did occur?
