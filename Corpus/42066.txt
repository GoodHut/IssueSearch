 URL : "https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/2904" TITLE : add zooming interface BODY : opening this after brief discussion with @jasongrout. i think it would be great if you could think a bit about how to make zooming more useful in jupyter lab. many people use jupyter to present, and getting everything the right size is a big pain point. using the browser zooming is probably not the right thing to do. zooming code and markdown and output font size is one possibility, depending on the application you might want to zoom images, too. but you rarely want to zoom the controls, so some way to zoom content without zooming controls would be really great. keep up the good work!
