 URL : "https://github.com/10up/windows-azure-storage/issues/47" TITLE : migrate existing media. BODY : hey! i have an existing wp blog with images located in the uploads folder locally on the server. i would like to migrate to azure. i have full access to wp db and the codebase i have already copied all the images to azure storage my idea is something like this. load all posts of type attachment for each post call some function in the azure plugin to mimic what happens on a file upload. i need help with what functions to call in the plugin. as the images are already located in azure storage i don't need to transfer any files. i guess parts of windows_azure_storage_new_media_object and windows_azure_storage_wp_update_attachment_metadata should do the job but i know to little about the plugin and wp filters/hooks to figure it out.
