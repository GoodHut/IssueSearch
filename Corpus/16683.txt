 URL : "https://github.com/bddean/emacs-ereader/issues/15" TITLE : links not working BODY : i downloaded this book from gutenburg http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4217 specifically the epub with pictures. after installing ereader, the book opens but the chapter links on the first 'page' do not work, returning a 'link not found' message. i opened the same book in ibooks and the links do work. it's fantastic to be able to open reference books in emacs and search them. thank you. i've not worked out how to annotate yet either.
