 URL : "https://github.com/Team-Doominati/Doominati/issues/57" TITLE : glyphrun native s BODY : currently text rendering is limited only by the fact that you can't do things with individual glyphs, only strings of characters. the current api is completely fine, for 90% of cases it's all you need and works great. the issue comes along when you need to do more complex text effects like having each character fade in individually, which without killing performance is currently impossible. the plan then is to add functions for getting information on and drawing particular glyphs in a font.
