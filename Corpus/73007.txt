 URL : "https://github.com/SkygearIO/features/issues/1" TITLE : cloud functions problems BODY : description while cloud functions have been heavily used by a lot of existing users, there are a few recurring requests we've got: 1. update code for cloud functions and test quickly in scale of seconds 2. easier test environment e.g. supply lambda functions parameter / http request parameters to test without launching the app; test should return console&error logs immediately. 3. easier to stream logs and search logs 4. default / built-in orm if we expect people to code in sql. easy to return records object from cloud function's sql query to client sdk 5. if one cloud functions crash, others should not be affected. related features
