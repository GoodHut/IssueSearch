 URL : "https://github.com/optonaut/ActiveLabel.swift/issues/200" TITLE : different fonts for links BODY : i think it would be really nice to be able to set different fonts for links and hashtags, or at least to be able to bold them. i thought this already existed because there were so many branches working on it but i couldn't find in the readme how to actually do it. if it does already exist could someone let me know how they've used it please?
