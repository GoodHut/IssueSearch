 URL : "https://github.com/james64/spark/issues/2" TITLE : spark multiple output BODY : hadoop has multiple outputs. this is different from partitioning in that multipleoutputs allows for totally different output paths with different schemas. different schemas are important. in spark this might be supported by having something like .write .multiple output columns a , b , write.options , .csv path1 , output columns c , d , write.parquet path2 where schema of original data is a , b , c , d . every record in multiple method may be separate dateframewriter. motivation: we are implementing hourly dumper with pii stripping. we want to store stripped data and stripped pii as separate outputs without need to cache intermediate results or compute all data twice.
