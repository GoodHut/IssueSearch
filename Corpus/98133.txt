 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33936" TITLE : improve git implementation BODY : the current git integration in vscode has a couple flaws most notably 9475 and could be improved. i think atom does a really good job with its git integration and would suggest something similar. the main benefits in my opinion : __not side-by-side__ if you select lines individually, you know exactly which lines will be staged, because line x does not exist twice. __buttons not hidden__ if you want to stage a selection, you have to go through the drop-down in vscode, which is one more step and takes a lot longer, even if this is a very common interaction. __selection of single lines__ as noted in 9475, this is currently not possible. a click next to a line should select exactly the selected line and not expand to any other line. __hunks__ nice to quickly scan the code and commit code blocks. here is a screenshot of atoms git integration: ! screen shot 2017-09-07 at 12 06 37 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6564077/30158936-36caf10a-93c7-11e7-9766-8203e9fc9de6.png
