BODY : currently the library supports being run on jvm's of version 6 or higher. this is controlled in the pom.xml by maven-compiler-plugin source and target fields . leaving support for java 6 may continue to enable the library to be used in some legacy environments do we know of any users doing this? the downside is we can't use any of the new java 7 or 8 api's. i'm thinking we should bump the minimum supported version to at least 7.
