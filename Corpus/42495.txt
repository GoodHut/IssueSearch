 URL : "https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/OpenDroneMap/issues/628" TITLE : beyond hahog features BODY : i am new to odm. not sure if this is a dummy question. i see odm uses hahog in feature detection. but opensfm actually supports akaze, sift, surf as well. what is the reason behind to pick hahog? in opensfm, these are configurable through config.yaml file. but i did not see that file in odm project. thanks!
