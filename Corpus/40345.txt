 URL : "https://github.com/jpatokal/openflights/issues/701" TITLE : tripit import busted BODY : importing from tripit pops up a window with this endpoint http://openflights.org/php/tripit_list_trips.php and this error message could not connect to tripit. please try again later though tripit seems to be responding ok by itself. i did an import once years ago, not sure if it cached the user/pass auth or was using oauth or if that's even the problem.
