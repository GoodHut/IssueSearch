 URL : "https://github.com/MichelVos/rpi_cpu_infoscreen/issues/2" TITLE : not working every time BODY : hello and thanks for sharing this code! we are using it in our project, however we experience a weird behavior. it does not work every time? when we spam the command like 5 times the text eventually shows up on the screen, and sometimes it does on the first try as expected. sometimes running the same command twice will first show the text and then clear the screen, but other times the text remains no matter how many times we run the same command. we need to use it programmatically and since we can not get a constant output you can see how this is a problem for us. can you suggest what might be the root of this? we will provide any information required!
