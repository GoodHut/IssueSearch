 URL : "https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/1878" TITLE : configurable output folder BODY : currently the project is always generating content into public folder. it is fine for most cases, however some people have different project structure and want to change it. how do you think about making this configurable via cli argument or gatsby-config.js ? for example: gatsby build --output-dir my-static-website public will remain default, of course.
