 URL : "https://github.com/openconfig/reference/issues/66" TITLE : path to leaf-list element BODY : has a gnmi path to leaf-list elements been considered? i can see it's not too useful to do a get on a leaf list element. but what would the path look like to delete a leaf list element? or suppose there is a subscription to a leaf-list and an element is added what path would be used in the subscribe response?
