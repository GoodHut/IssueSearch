 URL : "https://github.com/obsidianpkg/obsidian/issues/2" TITLE : two factor authentication BODY : optional two factor authentication for all account, with the ability for organizations and/or the appliance administrators to enforce the use of two factor authentication for all accounts. organizations with enforced two factor authentication will only allow users who have enabled 2fa to join, and will remove any members of the organization who do not have 2fa enabled at the time it is enforced. if the appliance administrators enforce 2fa, then users will be forced to enable it after logging in before they can perform any additional actions. appliance administrators should have the ability to generate one-time use codes for any user for the purposes of account recovery.
