 URL : "https://github.com/WesCook/Homestead/issues/3" TITLE : shaderpacks sky rendering BODY : i unfortunately do not know enough about the current mods to figure out what the issue is, but it seems that any shader pack i attempt to use has some sort of issue with sky rendering. either it's all one shade of color, or there's color flashes, or the sun renders as blue. i can't seem to find a shader pack that works. everything else works waving foliage, water reflection, shadows, etc but the sky rendering is always wrong. is there any shader pack that you know of that works with homestead?
