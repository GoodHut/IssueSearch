 URL : "https://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur/issues/1002" TITLE : ios: images fail to load BODY : on a regular basis, stories whose contents are exclusively or mostly images don't load their images. this happens most commonly with web comics but also with sites like flickr. this never happens on the web. this issue has been happening for months to perhaps even years. it is not consistent within a single feed â€” sometimes an image will load, sometimes it won't. the same thing affects the images in the article list. i have had trouble reproducing this with a debugger attached, but figured i might as well post a few examples here from today: ! img_2464 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/68303/24059801/bb8b8690-0b26-11e7-86c3-093c65b640a0.png ! img_2465 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/68303/24059809/c3aa798a-0b26-11e7-9555-227a3942c2ef.png you can see below that 4 recent xkcd comics loaded fine, and 2 didn't. ! img_2466 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/68303/24059875/133aad76-0b27-11e7-9e3d-2f7b92e60247.png
