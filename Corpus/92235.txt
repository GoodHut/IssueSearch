 URL : "https://github.com/bmuschko/gradle-tomcat-plugin/issues/164" TITLE : war overlay compatibility BODY : this plugin works fine with the war overlay plugin https://github.com/scalding/gradle-waroverlay-plugin when using the tomcatrunwar task, but the tomcatrun task doesn't seem to work - it doesn't include resources needed from the overlay wars. it would be great if these two could work together, or if anyone knows a workaround. i posted a similar question on their tracker - https://github.com/scalding/gradle-waroverlay-plugin/issues/10
