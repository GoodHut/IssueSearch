 URL : "https://github.com/spohlenz/tinymce-rails/issues/217" TITLE : trouble with importcss BODY : i'm just getting started with tinymce and have solved some issues but have looked at a variety of suggestions regarding getting the importcss plugin to access the application.css, and none of them seem to be working. i have one simple .testclass in my application.scss file, but i can not figure out how to get it to display in the format drop down per instructions on so, here, and on the tinymce homepage itself. i'm using a basic rails new setup with version 5. the only extra gems installed are tinymce and prism. my yml looks like this toolbar: - styleselect | bold italic | undo redo | format - image | link | codesample plugins: - image - codesample - link - importcss i have tried importcss_file_filter: asset_path 'application.css', and while this doesn't cause any trouble within the server, it doesn't show my testclass from the application.css file. i have put this in both the yml file and the direct call <%= tinymce importcss_file_filter: asset_path 'application.css' %>. neither way works. perhaps i'm just a neophyte, but if someone could point me in the right direction, it would be greatly appeciated. my custom built blog currently uses kramdown/coderay for creating content and it's quite limited. i'd love to switch it over to tinymce with prism, but i'd like to get the importcss working first.
