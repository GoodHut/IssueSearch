 URL : "https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues/7431" TITLE : installation failed on mac BODY : i tried to install anaconda for both python 2 and 3 using the graphical installer but neither worked. attached is my error log, i think it includes three installation attempts py3, py2, then py3 again . i hope it's not too much of a beeyach to figure it out. let me know if there is any way i can help. also information that is probably important: - i had both python 2 and 3 installed at some point but i think i uninstalled them - i'm running os 10.7.5 /users/meowemow/desktop/docs/fall2015/ek128/new era/install.log
