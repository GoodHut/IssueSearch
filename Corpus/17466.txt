 URL : "https://github.com/the-synister/the-source/issues/20" TITLE : playback is sharp BODY : hi, this issue could be due to my newbie-ness when it comes to vsts and plugin-based synthesizers, but in playback i need to set the main frequency to 408 hz to make synister in tune with all other instruments, but when i render the track the synth is then wildly flat. i'm using reaper. is this a known issue? thanks, malcolm
