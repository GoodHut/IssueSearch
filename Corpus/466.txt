 URL : "https://github.com/br3ttb/Arduino-PID-Library/issues/55" TITLE : ki kp kd BODY : well it is late at night, but wouldnt setcontrollerdirection https://github.com/br3ttb/arduino-pid-library/blob/master/pid_v1.cpp l34 pid::setcontrollerdirection controllerdirection ; pid::settunings kp, ki, kd ; work on uninitialised kp, ki, kd because setcontrollerdirection tries to switch them from plus to minus within the constructor before they are filled up by settunings ? i hope i dont waste your time on this, if this is bogus. i saw some warning within arduino and think this is the reason. greetings
