BODY : i tried write post_import script and and looks like: 1 when is defined type in objecttypes.xml and values are not changed, then are properties empty 2 object.has_meta type is always empty/doesn't exist. traverse the node tree and replace tiled objects func post_import scene : load scenes to instantiate and add to the level the scene variable contains the nodes as you see them in the editor. scene itself points to the top node. its children are the tile and object layers. for node in scene.get_children : to know the type of a node, check if it is an instance of a base class the addon imports tile layers as tilemap nodes and object layers as node2d if node extends tilemap: process tile layers. e.g. read the id of the individual tiles and replace them with random variations, or instantiate scenes on top of them pass if node extends node2d: for object in node.get_children : var name = object.get_name print entity name: +name var metalist = object.get_meta_list for item in metalist: print str item if object.has_meta type : var type = object.get_meta type print type: +type you must return the modified scene return scene
