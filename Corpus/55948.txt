 URL : "https://github.com/aletheia-foundation/admin/issues/36" TITLE : make a mozfest project BODY : speak to roo, figure out what will be done by october, add all the related issues to their own project. ideally would be good to have a downloadable client, upload and download documents, search function, something basic people can play with. perhaps just move aletheia 1.0 from end of year to mozfest end of october?
