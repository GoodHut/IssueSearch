 URL : "https://github.com/object88/cprofile/issues/11" TITLE : support workspace loading BODY : the current code expects to follow imports from a particular package, but this is not in line with the needs of consuming a project workspace. for example, if a project is open in an ide, the program entry point will not necessarily align the root of the workspace: ~/go/src/github.com/foo/myproject/main vs ~/go/src/github.com/foo/myproject if myproject is the root for cprofile, it will not ingest main if that is where func main lives, due to go's circular package reference avoidance. if this library is going to be useful in an ide that doesn't implicitly understand the ideal package starting point.
