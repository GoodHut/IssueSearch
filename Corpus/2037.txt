 URL : "https://github.com/GoogleChrome/http2-push-manifest/issues/13" TITLE : push vs pull BODY : there are -in theory- two ways to efficiently load web resources from a website, one is the push method and the other one which nobody talks about is the pull method where the client is in charge of initiating requests to pull the necessary resources. both methods will require some manifest to guide on pull or push just the required files, and both have different implications. push will require https, http2 support etc... but most importantly it doesn't know about which files are already there at the client's cache. pull will require a service worker on the client... it's only supported on chrome, but i guess it will land on all other major webbrowsers soon. so my question is. if we aim at the future, what would be the preferred method and why?
