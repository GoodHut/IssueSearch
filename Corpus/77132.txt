 URL : "https://github.com/Pext/Pext/issues/42" TITLE : module permission system BODY : this will be rather complex, and won't be any time soon, but will be basically the following: - all modules should run in their own process - there should be a file defining what a module can do like where to read/write files - jail the modules properly look into something like firejail, but cross platform. discussions and suggestions welcome.
