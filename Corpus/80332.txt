 URL : "https://github.com/gphoto/libgphoto2/issues/146" TITLE : timeout with nikon d5200 BODY : i have 40 nikon d5200 cameras attached to one server. i'm calling gphoto2 --get-all-files on each camera and all as a separate process which makes it faster using ampersand in bash script . this was working 100% of the time with gphoto2 2.5.9. i'm now using the latest gphoto2 2.5.11 and libghoto2 2.5.12 and i get timeout errors on some of the cameras. i've attached the debug output here: nikond5200log.txt https://github.com/gphoto/libgphoto2/files/852152/nikond5200log.txt does anyone know how i can avoid these timeouts?
