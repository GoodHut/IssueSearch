 URL : "https://github.com/aleclarson/cara/issues/8" TITLE : js tree shaking BODY : using es modules, we can eliminate unused modules by statically analyzing the ast. there's probably an npm package that does this. we may also want to use babel-plugin-minify-dead-code-elimination https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/minify-dead-code-elimination to eliminate dead code within each module. these things would only be done for production bundles, since parsing the ast on every change is slow unless we keep asts in memory like parcel does which may be something we do down the line .
