 URL : "https://github.com/chrmarti/testissues/issues/10482" TITLE : nuke the log-decorator BODY : re !39572 ts !log loglevel.info, 'commandservice', msg, id => ${msg} ${id} executecommand<t> id: string, ...args: any : tpromise<t> { // .. } this looks very pretty and i believe it's a prime-sample for a decorator but once you wanna debug calls to executecommand you will hate it. really hate it. my recommendation is nuke it or not recommend it...
