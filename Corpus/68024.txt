 URL : "https://github.com/Nordstrom/kubelogin/issues/8" TITLE : refactor package layout BODY : @adamcarlton move kubelogin_server.go to cmd/server/main.go and move any supporting packages to pkg/something . the pkg/ tree is for things shared by the server and client, or things that are used in the server, but not directly part of its main . see https://github.com/coreos/dex/tree/master/cmd/example-app for an example.
