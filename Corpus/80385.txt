 URL : "https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk/issues/349" TITLE : track coverage on github BODY : at least via a readme badge. perhaps use something like https://coveralls.io/, which also integrates with prs. can even be set up to mark prs as red if the coverage drops by more than a treshold e.g. 0.1% . there's also codecov: https://codecov.io/ not sure which of the two we should use, as long as both support these important features.
