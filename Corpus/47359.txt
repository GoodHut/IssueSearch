 URL : "https://github.com/backbee/backbee-php/issues/786" TITLE : page publication date BODY : the page publication date should be set to the date of the first status change to online if not explicitly set through the publication/depublication programmer. without this, there's no page publication date when not explicitly set and the only reliable date is the page creation date, which is not very accurate/pertinent.
