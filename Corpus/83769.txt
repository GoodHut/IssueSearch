 URL : "https://github.com/africanmathsinitiative/R-Instat/issues/3529" TITLE : climatic > start of rains BODY : this is another subtle issue. i did start of rains for dodoma in my last session. now i did it again with a new definition. it sent the results to a new file called dodoma_by_shiftyear1 rather than adding the column to the original file, which is still there and is called dodoma_by_shiftyear.
