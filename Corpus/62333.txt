 URL : "https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv/issues/200" TITLE : clarification in readme BODY : regarding this: https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv should-i-have-multiple-env-files >we strongly recommend against having a main .env file and an environment .env file like .env.test ...you should not be sharing values between environments. these statements seem to be contradictory. i may want to have .env.development and .env.staging separate api keys , but the above sentence says it's strongly discouraged, but then says we shouldn't be sharing values between environments.. which is why someone would want separate .env files for dev/staging/prod.
