 URL : "https://github.com/bbockelm/cms-htcondor-es/issues/2" TITLE : cmssw version not reported BODY : it looks like in es analysis jobs have their cmssw version in the crab_jobsw attribute, but production jobs don't have anything like that. would it be possible to add an attribute called jobsw for all jobs to contain the cmssw version used? the field should be defined for any job running cmssw.
