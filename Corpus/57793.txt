 URL : "https://github.com/DeskproApps/deskpro-components/issues/8" TITLE : remove compiled assets BODY : it's unusual to have compiled assets in this repos. i checked a few libs reactjs, redux, react-bootstrap, react-router and they don't. these compiled assets make it difficult to code review, and it will introduce unnecessarily complex merges/conflicts down the road. i think the reason was because we're using the components as-is in deskpro? https://github.com/deskpro/deskpro/blob/develop/www/assets/build/pub/package.json l18 if that's the case, then a workaround in deskpro is possible instead. here's what i think we should do: 1. git ignore the lib/ dir in this repos 2. in deskpro land, hack the dev and prod scripts to build deskpro-components first i.e. in the actual node_modules/deskpro-components dir . 3. btw the name in deskpro is wrong, it should be deskpro-components currently deskpro-styles . so eventually when this lib is more mature we will use an actual npm distribution where the assets in the distro are compiled. but for now while we use the git repos, this seems like an acceptable hack.
