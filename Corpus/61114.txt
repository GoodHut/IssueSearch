BODY : read first: <https://github.com/gorhill/ublock/blob/master/contributing.md> describe the issue i would like to know if it's possible to add dummy websocket redirect like we are doing with scripts and images 307 . let's take sport5.co.il for example with hebrewlist filters, they are detecting the csp by using try catch on the websocket creation and then they just remove the entire images of the article. i've struggled myself whether to post it here or on ublock assets but since i saw there is no possible way to redirect websocket, i thought that the best place would be here. one or more specific urls where the issue occurs http://www.sport5.co.il/articles.aspx?folderid=64&docid=238673&lang=he screenshot in which the issue can be seen ! sport5 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19405330/23894254/12c8b16e-08aa-11e7-9d39-2790601593ac.png steps for anyone to reproduce the issue 1. just surf the website. your settings ublock for chrome with hebrewlist - browser/version: chrome 56 - ublock origin version: 1.11.2 your filter lists easylist + hebrewlist your custom filters if any none
