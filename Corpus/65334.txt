 URL : "https://github.com/brunch/less-brunch/issues/44" TITLE : infinite loop in v2.8.0 BODY : with the release of less-brunch 2.8.0, this plugin is now breaking my builds. or i should say, sending them into an infinite loop of some sort. we had a build take 50+ minutes just outputting lesscompiler is taking long to process every 15 seconds. we had to kill it manually. i will try to create a sample that reproduces this as soon as i can, but i wanted to create the issue in case there was an obvious reason this was happening.
