 URL : "https://github.com/bil-elmoussaoui/Icon-Requests/issues/16" TITLE : add help documentation BODY : i don't know what audience the application is planned for, but it would be nice if it easily usable for anyone. a guide on how the application works might then be useful. i have three main ideas on how it could be implemented - tooltips in the application. for example it wasn't obvious for me what exactly report means, and it might not be obvious for everyone what hardcoded means. hovering over those buttons could open a tooltip on what it means. - some sort of a help dialog that opens from the menu. i have no idea how hard this it to implement. - just adding some text to the readme file here on github.
