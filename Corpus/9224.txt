 URL : "https://github.com/openmodal/OpenModal/issues/14" TITLE : uff 58 handling BODY : the software currently supports only uff58 format, when time/frequency spacing is set to uneven data in 3 columns in the file . if the spacing is even data in 4 columns the file cannot be imported. the former would be a nice improvement, in order to allow the import of files from other software, which use the even spacing format.
