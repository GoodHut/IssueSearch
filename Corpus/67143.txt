 URL : "https://github.com/tplgy/cppcodec/issues/27" TITLE : owner access for jpetso BODY : i don't seem to have write access to edit the project description or repository anymore, which is a logical consequence of not being with topology anymore. i figure i won't be able to accept pull requests either. however, i'd like to continue being a maintainer. forking is suboptimal as the url changes and i can't take the stars with me. @efidler, can you make me co-owner or something to that effect?
