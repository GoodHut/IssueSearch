 URL : "https://github.com/klevstul/NoCountryRedirect/issues/26" TITLE : status icon in omnibox BODY : the status icon in omnibox could rather disappear when inactive. this behavior i've seen on many extensions, like extension source viewer. the pop-up that's with the icon not sure if it functions like it should in opera: there is activity/inactivity info and possibilities to open current page in incognito and open ext settings.
