 URL : "https://github.com/csstree/stylelint-validator/issues/3" TITLE : ignoring less variables BODY : i took this lovely plugin for a whirl today, it correctly discovered some issues where my team had written invalid syntax, however the majority of the errors it reported was the csstree/validator rule choking on less variables, ex: src/component/component.less 28:13 ✖ can't parse value @link-hover-color csstree/validator 54:9 ✖ can't parse value @icon-color csstree/validator any idea how to mute or ignore less variables i'm assuming the same goes for sass variables . thanks!
