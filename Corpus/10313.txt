 URL : "https://github.com/phpipam/phpipam/issues/1077" TITLE : bulk resolve dns BODY : when adding a subnet to phpipam and clicking the scan subnet button it resolves and saves all dns entries to the database. if you then bulk edit a range of ip's to enter e.g. a comment, the hostname entry is lost. because the records are existing the scan subnet won't resolve de hostnames any more. is there a way to make phpipam do a scheduled scan of all existing hosts in a subnet which resolves the hostnames? thanks
