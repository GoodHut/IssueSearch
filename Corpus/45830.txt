 URL : "https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/11286" TITLE : inverting the y axis? BODY : description of the problem i need to use three.js with the y axis pointing down instead of up. as far as i have seen, it doesn't seem to be an existing feature. is it something that could be done? changing the camera up vector would also mean that the x direction would change for example, so this is not a viable solution. i am not sure how axis are handled so i don't know if what i am asking makes sense, but basically in my engine i use pixi.js or three.js depending on situations, and i would like both to have the same y direction.
