 URL : "https://github.com/migueldvb/cine/issues/4" TITLE : python 2 not supported? BODY : if i try to import cine from python 2.7, i get a syntaxerror: only named arguments may follow expression ... but the setup.py implies that 2.x is supposed to be supported. i'm agnostic whether you want to support py2 or not, but it should be stated in the readme and the setup.py should be consistent what major version s of python are supported.
