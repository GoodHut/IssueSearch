 URL : "https://github.com/kennethreitz/pipenv/issues/759" TITLE : documentation links broken BODY : shocked at the version number jumps pipenv has made lately, i updated and pip --envs guided me to what i wanted locating venvs with a project ; $ pipenv --envs the following environment variables can be set, to do various things: - pipenv_shell_fancy - pipenv_venv_in_project - pipenv_colorblind - pipenv_nospin - pipenv_pipfile - pipenv_default_python_version - pipenv_dont_load_env - pipenv_yes - pipenv_max_subprocess - pipenv_max_depth - pipenv_virtualenv - pipenv_use_system - pipenv_use_hashes - pipenv_skip_validation - pipenv_dotenv_location - pipenv_hide_emojis - pipenv_timeout - pipenv_install_timeout - pipenv_dont_use_pyenv - pipenv_shell you can learn more at: http://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/advanced.html configuration-with-environment-variables problem is: that link is broken sorry - that page doesn't exist . ok - no problem. i'll search for configuration with environment variables - great! two links found; one that looks like a toc entry, and one like the section i want. but - both those links are broken too. what gives? well, it turns out that taking the /en/latest out of any of those links gets you to the desired place. and in general! you might want to avoid locking links on to the en encoding, anyway.
