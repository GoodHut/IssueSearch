 URL : "https://github.com/resin-io-playground/resin-supervisor-sdk/issues/2" TITLE : export python lib BODY : currently haxe exports the class as package_class. so you have to do import resin_supervisor . doesn't look like haxe allows custom exports for python but i think we can just add a custom __init__.py to /dist at compile time.
