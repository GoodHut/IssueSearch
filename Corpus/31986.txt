in this session we will explore the environmental impact of cloud storage by asking lots of questions. what is the cloud? how does it work? why do we call it the cloud? how does the language of the cloud act as barrier? do tech giants mask the environmental impact of their operations by evoking the ephemeral airy image of clouds in the sky? a typical white fluffy cumulus cloud weighs one hundred elephants. we will do some fast fun writing exercises to explore what other kinds of language might we use to describe the environmental impact of the digital cloud in human terms we can understand and act upon. what is the goal or outcome of your session?
the goal of this session is to raise awareness of the environmental impact of cloud storage in two ways: 1 by calling attention to the ways in which the ephemeral language evoked by tech giants masks the serious environmental effects of cloud storage; 2 by putting the digital cloud into a broader context. the physical infrastructure of the cloud is built upon layers of earlier systems of transmission and storage of information. if we can recognise these larger patterns perhaps we can become more engaged in advocating for more environmentally friendly modes of data storage. if your session requires additional materials or electronic equipment, please outline your needs.
i'd like a data projector. note, i can probably find accommodation in london, but i am an independent artist / writer living a long way out - a travel stipend would make a huge difference to me. time needed
