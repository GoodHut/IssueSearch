 URL : "https://github.com/dleehr/batchspawner/issues/1" TITLE : fix hub ip/port overrides BODY : the following are overridden the following in the base submit_batch_script, since my server's external ip is different than its internal ip. i can't bind to the external ip since the server doesn't know about it: self.hub.host = '10.16.72.72' self.hub.port = 8081 self.hub.server.ip = '10.16.72.72' self.hub.server.port = 8081 this may be a non issue if we don't need to remotely spawn.
