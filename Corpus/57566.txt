 URL : "https://github.com/eloquence/freeyourstuff.cc/issues/70" TITLE : quora download timeout BODY : yes, quora. i'm sorry. i have had multiple freezes and timeouts as well in my attempt to free my content. my download has just finished, and while it has the correct answer count 2500 , it seems to have redownloaded multiple instances of the latest few answers, with the consequence that it is missing my first few months. it would appear that when download is reattempted, it starts from the top answer, but does not deduplicate newly downloaded answers. i'm happy to try writing the other two plugins needed, btw, but waiting for this to clear up first. : user name opoudjis at gmail . com, in case you want to inspect my content.
