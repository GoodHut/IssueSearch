 URL : "https://github.com/claranet/puppet-consul_template/issues/100" TITLE : update module structure BODY : adopt module structure to the github internal fork https://github.com/github/puppet-consul_template . it has several advantages: - the interfaces provide a config_hash and config_defaults instead of individual parameters to both allow access to the full set of configuration options and avoid the need to make module changes as consul-template configuration evolves. - it allows a much leaner implementation, adding options to consul_template::config is quite confusing.
