 URL : "https://github.com/ralphtheninja/mqtt-docker/issues/2" TITLE : problem with permissions BODY : there is a problem with the permissions where in order to run we need to chmod -r 777 var . i am thinking that is because the image ansi/mosquitto runs under the non-priviledged user mosquitto . hopefully there is a workaround that can allow for this not to be necessary. i don't know how to fix it otherwise i would send a pull request.
