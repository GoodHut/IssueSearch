 URL : "https://github.com/oblador/react-native-progress/issues/79" TITLE : progress bar is empty BODY : i am fetching data and getting a json response back that returns a number like this 7.5833 and because this progress bar can only handle 0 thru 1 i multiply my number by .1 which will return .7583300000000001 i am doing the following and it is just an empty bar with a border. this was working but not anymore. <progress.bar progress={this.state.data.progress .1} width={200} /> what could be wrong?
