 URL : "https://github.com/pcww/builder/issues/128" TITLE : add strip button issue BODY : main bug the '+add strip' button was going haywire. it didn't seem to want to engage at times - specifically after zooming in/out, and sometimes after moving the 'length size bar'. every board i created was done before utilizing any other step-1 feature options, just to be sure i didn't have to start over due to not being able to add a strip. that would be impossible for a customer. i'm guessing the zoom will be activated instantly. was this an issue you ran into ever, or is it just me? -jason
