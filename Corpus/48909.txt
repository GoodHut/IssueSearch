 URL : "https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/325" TITLE : start position of app BODY : i am unable to set the start position for the app. i use a frameless app which also makes it unmovable. this is good in my case however the app defailts to center electron default . i think this is due to: x: mainwindowstate.x, y: mainwindowstate.y, in main.js. if i change it to x: 0, y: 0, this has no effect. any ideas on how i can fix this? thank you, ivo
