 URL : "https://github.com/mbarquin/reactphp-slim/issues/5" TITLE : rfc general changes BODY : thinking of adding unit, integration and other tests as well as removing the directory for vendor-bin , adding docker integration and upgrading both slimphp and reactphp. i feel this would allow the project to mature more and allow people to get up and running and even get the project to the point of using composer create-project reactphp-slim <app_name> . would this be something you would be interested in?
