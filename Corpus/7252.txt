 URL : "https://github.com/hzi-braunschweig/SORMAS-Open/issues/123" TITLE : event data sync BODY : moved from 69 - sync event persons together with events app - backend: sync event persons based on user roles - create/update persons if needed app - check the location in eventdto, when it is new it seems that it is send with any field null. this throws nullpointers while persiting in app, because the app only check for null on the given location, not every property. we have to reorder this.
