 URL : "https://github.com/larsgw/citation.js/issues/53" TITLE : csl-json dates are wrong BODY : problem the csl-json date format used in citation.js is wrong, and therefore not picked up by citeproc-js. consequence all dates are omitted in all formatted citation.js output. cause when designing this version of citation.js, a different date format was taken into account, as that was the documented format back then. expected solution solution isn't trivial, but not really complex either. just a lot of time making sure everything is updated. problem expected to be fixed in v0.3.0-11 .
