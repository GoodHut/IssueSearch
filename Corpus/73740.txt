 URL : "https://github.com/DanielAndreasen/SWEETer-Cat/issues/49" TITLE : default plot form values BODY : it would be nice for testing if we didn't have to set and pass in all the plot form values test_data here each time. test_data = { color : blue , x : teff , y : mass , z : none , x1 : 8000, x2 : 2500, y1 : 0, y2 : 5, xscale : linear , yscale : log , checkboxes : } plot = client.post url_for plot , data=test_data, follow_redirects=true but just the one or two values you want to test at the time such as test_data = { x : feh ,, xscale : log } e.g. we could give default values if key is not in request.form by changing color = request.form 'color' -> color = request.form.get 'color', 'blue' one possible problem with this is if the template is changed and broken so that the form is missing values then the app will still work without raising an error .
