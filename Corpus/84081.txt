 URL : "https://github.com/stevegraham/slanger/issues/224" TITLE : could not find app by key BODY : i am integrating slanger with a rails app. after running redis-server and slanger -v --app_key 111111 --secret 222222 it loads slanger, so far so good. however, when i run the app, i get the next error: > pusher : error : { type : websocketerror , error :{ type : pushererror , data :{ code :4001, message : could not find app by key xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx }}} i'm not sure why it's getting that key, when in my app i set 111111. other than that, if i stop the redis-server, and run the slanger and then the app, i get the same error. shouldn't i get an error with redis connection or something?
