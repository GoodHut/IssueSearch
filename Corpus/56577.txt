 URL : "https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/5897" TITLE : no conda commands work BODY : hi all, upon trying basically any conda command, i get the following error: fetching package metadata ... condahttperror: http none none for url <https://repo.continuum.io/pkgs/free/win-64/repodata.json.bz2> elapsed: none an http error occurred when trying to retrieve this url. http errors are often intermittent, and a simple retry will get you on your way. sslerror sslerror sslerror bad handshake: syscallerror 10054, 'wsaeconnreset' , , , after some searching around here for similar issues i have tried turning off ssl verify using this command: conda config --set ssl_verify false ...which succeeds but does not help the problem. i can get to the https://repo.continuum.io/pkgs/free/win-64/ path via a browser and download files directly, but cannot install or update using conda. can't do conda update conda, etc. i assume my company's firewall setup is preventing this -- but i'm not sure what to test to get to the real root cause. any thoughts?
