 URL : "https://github.com/ActiDoo/pyramid_swagger_spec/issues/2" TITLE : get rid of path parameter BODY : when using traversal: - for the developer it would be best to just define the context and leave out the path definition. - but: the swagger-definition needs a concrete url can we derive possible urls from our ressources ? probably not possible using the default-ressource requirements. suggestion 1: - create a base class / interface for the ressources - derive urls from that suggestions 2: - keep the developer define the urls either in the decorator - or in the routes.py, reference using route_name - add traversal option to the decorator which defines the traversal path - route/traversal should be a list to support multiple locations
