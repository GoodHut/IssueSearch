 URL : "https://github.com/tokejepsen/conda-git-deployment/issues/30" TITLE : current working directory BODY : issue when an environment is the same between two launches, but the directory where conda-git-deployment resides are different, then the egg-links will be pointing to the wrong paths for the repositories. this happens mostly when dealing with windows mounts, but can easily happen on other occasions like when testing deployments. implementation similar to how we deal with updating the environment on changes, we'll store the path to current working directory. in essence we'll store the hash value of both the environment and the current working directory, and compare.
