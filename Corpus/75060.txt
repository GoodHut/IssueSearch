 URL : "https://github.com/nusenu/ContactInfo-Information-Shareing-Specification/issues/1" TITLE : further specify os field BODY : i think the os field is currently underspecified: > string stating which os and version is used. os and version is separated with a / sign. > > example: openbsd/6.1 for linux distributions, is the os “linux” or the distribution name? and is the version the linux kernel version or the distribution version? in the latter case: what about rolling-release distributions like arch? on linux systems, i would suggest using the id and version_id fields from /etc/os-release https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/os-release.html . note that the version_id field is optional. i’m less familiar with bsd, but i take it the version number is unambiguous there?
