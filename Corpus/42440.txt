 URL : "https://github.com/vmw-loginsight/webhook-shims/issues/52" TITLE : basic auth not passed BODY : li 4.5 added basic auth to webhooks -- vrops has always had this capability. the shims should natively support this, but they do not today. need a generic solution e.g. in init.py , but also need to update all shims that have hard-coded credential variables in them e.g. jira to accept basic auth based by webhooks.
