 URL : "https://github.com/slashdotdash/commanded/issues/74" TITLE : projections per category BODY : _i'll just leave this here, as i personally would find this useful. feel free to close it if it's irrelevant._ it would be nice to support a simple catch-up-subscription, per category , with client persistent state. for example, i would like to project all events from $ce-cars category. using the current competing consumers, it is hard to make commanded integrate with other non-commanded systems using es. for example, i would like system a to publish events to cars-123 stream. system a is using http api. then system b with commanded would subscribe to $ce-cars$ and project all the cars into a sql table. i guess i'm not sure what this will involve, because using extreme is already sufficient, but this is just a thought. maybe you can make an even nicer abstraction.
