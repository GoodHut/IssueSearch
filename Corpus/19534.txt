 URL : "https://github.com/winpython/winpython/issues/499" TITLE : add gmpy2 package? BODY : winpython already includes sympy and its required dependency mpmath. mpmath uses gmpy/gmpy2 for greater speed if it is installed: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ gmpy my testing with mp.prec=114 equivalent to float128 shows gmpy2 speeds up heavy functions by a factor of 2! therefore, i always install gmpy2 in winpython. the wheel is about 0.5mb. it would save me some time if future winpython builds included gmpy2.
