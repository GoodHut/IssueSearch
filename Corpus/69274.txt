 URL : "https://github.com/mdomke/pytest-mongodb/issues/6" TITLE : support for python 3.5? BODY : hi, is there! thanks very much for your module, it's very helpful for testing our backend : i noticed you only list support for python <= 3.4. when i tried running the tests with 3.5, this line https://github.com/mdomke/pytest-mongodb/blob/develop/pytest_mongodb/plugin.py l108 caused me trouble, just as described here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35051867/json-load-function-give-strange-unicodedecodeerror-ascii-codec-cant-decod i could add a pr for this specifically, but i guess that a more concerted effort might be needed to add full python 3.5 support. thanks!
