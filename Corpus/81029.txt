 URL : "https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues/2275" TITLE : validate version strings BODY : while working on piwheels https://github.com/bennuttall/piwheels , we came across a package release with the following version number : sysv_ipc gives python programs access to system v semaphores, shared memory and message queues. most all? unixes including os x support system v ipc. windows+cygwin 1.7 might also work. sample code is included. this extension is released under the gpl. you might also be interested in the similar posix ipc module at: http://semanchuk.com/philip/posix_ipc/ see the json https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sysv_ipc/ for the sysv_ipc package on pypi https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sysv_ipc/ . it seems this package version spec was permitted by pypi but isn't valid, i.e. you can't run pip install sysv_ipc==version with this as the version. would it be possible for warehouse to validate version strings to prevent this?
