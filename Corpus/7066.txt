 URL : "https://github.com/teijo/jquery-bracket/issues/130" TITLE : custom team ids BODY : as far i can see the data-teamid are generated using an index sequence, would be possible to pass the team id from the backend? it will help to then save the correct id values in the database an correctly show the winners of the event. what i'm doing now is to save the winners using the team names but it could cause errors if two teams has the same name which is possible in my system , so what is the best way to save the winners of the event using ids from the backend? thanks for this great library!
