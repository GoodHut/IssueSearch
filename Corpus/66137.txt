 URL : "https://github.com/singularityhub/singularityhub.github.io/issues/13" TITLE : manually trigger builds BODY : this is quite related to issue 4 it would be nice to be able to turn off automatic builds and then just manually trigger builds when needed. this would save you computational resources and save me from feeling bad when i accidentally trigger a build. i keep a dockerfile and a singularity file in the same repo. i need to first trigger docker hub build and then trigger singularity hub build when the docker hub build is finished. i want to just commit the changes to the dockerfile, then have the docker hub build the image and finally after an hour or so trigger a singularity hub build. right now i must first build on dockerhub, then activate the branch on singularity hub and then make a new meaningless commit to trigger the singularity build. even better would be to both have a manual trigger button, and in addition be able to build every time the bootstrapped docker image changes. i guess this requires some webhooks and in general a lot more work than just having a trigger build button.
