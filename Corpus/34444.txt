 URL : "https://github.com/polimediaupv/paella/issues/285" TITLE : changeable asset url BODY : hello, nice player : but i have a problem to integrate it into my website. the player should be displayed within the video-template no spa . but if i navigate to localhost:8080/video/1223abcxy the assets like config.json, etc. could not be found. i already changed the html-head to access the root of the project like so <script type= text/javascript src= /javascript/paella_player.js ></script> but the uri in the js-files are still depending on the browser-url, e.g. localhost:8080/video/1223abcxy/config/config.json how can i make paella player work, if the assets are under root and the player not?
