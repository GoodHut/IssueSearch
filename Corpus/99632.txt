 URL : "https://github.com/JuliaGPU/GPUArrays.jl/issues/45" TITLE : multiplying small matrices BODY : we rely on base to route a b calls to the correct blas routines. but base actually reroutes small matrices to a julia implementation here: https://github.com/julialang/julia/blob/master/base/linalg/matmul.jl l336 we need to overload this and change the behaviour for gpuarrays. i'm almost inclined to throw an error, since no one should actually multiply a 4x4 matrix on the gpu like that. ref: 44
