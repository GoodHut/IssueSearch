 URL : "https://github.com/lyft/scoop/issues/84" TITLE : status of scoop? BODY : is scoop still being maintained? i really enjoy using this library as it makes prototyping out an app very easy. what was the reason for removing the exit & enter transition annotations from the library? i had thought that this was a major selling point of this library as you gain an animation simply by adding an annotation. can the layout annotation be used instead of having a layout method in the controller? i would be willing to help with issues in order to help keep this library updated for the community.
