 URL : "https://github.com/duvenaud/relax/issues/1" TITLE : computing v' in appendix b BODY : dear authors, thanks for sharing your code. i noticed a difference between the code and paper in computing \tilde{z}. specifically, in the code https://github.com/duvenaud/relax/blob/198bbb36efd4f4fc2d1289a0c277bb8f90ebe8b7/relax-autograd/relax.py l30 1-\theta is performed, but in appendix b of the paper when computing v', \theta is directly used. is the latter a typo, or am i missing something? thanks
