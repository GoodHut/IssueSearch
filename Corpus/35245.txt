 URL : "https://github.com/ZeroK-RTS/Zero-K/issues/1922" TITLE : disable tts default? BODY : this is a discussion that really needs to happen before release. to quote myself: >i think there are pretty good reasons why no other strategy game has a feature like this. it's intrusive, the voice isn't nice to listen to, many of the things converted to speech are useless wastes of attention like lol , lobster , etc., and it seems like it would be fairly easy to abuse. possibly there are some checks built in for abuse cases; i've never had it on for long enough to find out. judging from the votes in the forum thread so far, many more people support disable rather than enable as default.
