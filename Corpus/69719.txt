 URL : "https://github.com/tendenci/tendenci/issues/611" TITLE : translation i18n issues BODY : unfortunately, it appears that tendenci mis-uses {% blocktrans %} in a lot of places, leading to lots of untranslated strings. {% blocktrans %} is intended to support the translation of template strings. it does not translate any variables substituted into the template. so, for example: {% with adjective_noun= quick brown fox %} {% blocktrans %}the {{adjective_noun}} jumped over the lazy dog.{% endblocktrans %} the above will cause django to look for a translation of the string the {{adjective_noun}} jumped over the lazy dog. , then django will substitute the untranslated string quick brown fox into the translated template. to translate the full string, you must do something like: {% trans quick brown fox as adjective_noun %} {% blocktrans %}the {{adjective_noun}} jumped over the lazy dog.{% endblocktrans %} alternatively, you can add a custom template filter like: @register.filter name='translate' def translate text : return ugettext text then do this: {% with adjective_noun_text= quick brown fox %} {% blocktrans with adjective_noun=adjective_noun_text|translate %}the {{adjective_noun}} jumped over the lazy dog.{% endblocktrans %} however, tendenci contains many instances of things like: {% blocktrans with e=error %}{{ e }}{% endblocktrans %} , which doesn't actually do anything. in addition, tendenci contains a number of {% blocktrans %} blocks that unnecessarily contain html tags, which is generally considered bad form since the associated translations will need to be rewritten any time the html changes.
