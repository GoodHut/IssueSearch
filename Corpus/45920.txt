 URL : "https://github.com/robcowart/elastiflow/issues/9" TITLE : issue with timestamp? BODY : hi i'm not sure if this is an issue with logstash, elasticsearch or kibana but i'm basically pulling in netflow records from my home router onto a vm where i'm testing elastiflow. the timestamp on the records however are +2 hours from the actual time. the router is set to sync with a local ntp server so router time is correct. the vm also has the correct time. any idea where/how the time conversion is happening?
