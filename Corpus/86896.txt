 URL : "https://github.com/go-telegram-bot-api/telegram-bot-api/issues/128" TITLE : incomplete error messages BODY : hi. when there's an error while sending a request, it doesn't output full error message. for example, when user has blocked the bot, i receive forbidden in error rather than bot_was_blocked_by_user or sometimes i receive bad request errors and i can't say why there's a bad request because it doesn't mention details. edit := tgbotapi.neweditmessagetext int64 chatid , messageid, text message, err := bot.api.send edit if err != nil { fmt.println message, err // here it returns an empty message and bad request }
