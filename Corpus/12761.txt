 URL : "https://github.com/symfony/recipes/issues/309" TITLE : rfc demo recipes BODY : hello, i see many symfony bundles providing demo applications to help the users with their best practices and/or how to actually expand their application using the bundle features. some problems related: - those repositories get outdated, symfony and bundle wise - it requires the user to clone a project and not experience how it is to setup the application advantages: - the demos following the recipe will make it clear what is being copied - it can be removed - you can maintain easily the versions update - makes symfony flex even more used proposed solutions: choose one to discuss - make a install demo y/n during the require process - a new recipes-demo repository - allow current recipes to install the demo either way least favorite for me - something else? comments please i'm looking forward to hear some opinions on this
