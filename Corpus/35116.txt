 URL : "https://github.com/copious-cookbooks/users/issues/2" TITLE : default admin groups BODY : i feel like there's an odd disconnect between the groups in the databags and what group a user ultimately ends up in. if i create a user with the sudo group, i would expect the user to end up there, not in another group. if we want a user to be in the default group, it should be set in the databag. i think this flaw originated in a prior project and am looking to correct this. @jerrywardlow what are your thoughts? admin_group = node 'users' 'group' 'admin' users.each do |u| user = data_bag_item 'users', u home = /home/ {user 'id' } admin_users << user 'id' if user 'groups' && user 'groups' .include? 'sudo'
