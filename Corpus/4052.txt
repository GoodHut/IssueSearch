 URL : "https://github.com/GSA/api-documentation-template/issues/41" TITLE : add html files BODY : the current structure uses jekyll/markdown and html files are not exposed or shared. gh pages generates those in the background. consider including the html files in this repo in some fashion, so that projects who wanted to use the html on a separate host could use those without the markdown. this could be done by including the _site files from the local build, which are currently in the .gitignore file. probably configure the jekyll build to move them to a different folder.
