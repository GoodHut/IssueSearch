 URL : "https://github.com/aspnet/JavaScriptServices/issues/591" TITLE : docker node version BODY : hi there. is there any reason to use 4.x version of node instead of latest 7.x versions in dockerfile? run wget -qo- https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_4.x | bash - 6.x is recommanded as lts but with es6 features provided in the 7 version, it would be great to update docker version. i found no issue/error running the spa on both node 7 and node 6 versions. but if there is any other consideration, let us know.
