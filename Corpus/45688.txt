 URL : "https://github.com/uglow/conventional-changelog-angular-bitbucket/issues/10" TITLE : incorrect commit link BODY : the commit links in the generated change log looks like this: https://bitbucket.org/projects/humblebee/repos/customerportal-ui-components/commits/4cba59f but in my case the actual link should look like this with projects and repos omitted form the url. https://bitbucket.org/humblebee/customerportal-ui-components/commits/4cba59f are you following a certain convention that i'm not aware ofâ€š or is there a way to alter the link through the options to match the path to my projects commit messages? thank you, /john
