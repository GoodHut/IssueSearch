BODY : hi all, i'm trying to make my code compatible with old scipy versions and i'm stuck in errors coming from fmin_l_bfgs_b from the lbfgsb module in optimize. in particular for scipy version 0.9. i've simplified my inputs to the function as much as possible. even with just passing the first two parameters, i get: file /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/scipy/optimize/lbfgsb.py , line 190, in fmin_l_bfgs_b isave, dsave _lbfgsb.error: failed in converting 4th argument u' of _lbfgsb.setulb to c/fortran array u' is supposed to be the upper bound constraints for the optimization, but it should be handled as none if nothing is passed no bounds . i tried passing bounds= -np.inf, np.inf len x0 explicitly and a few other things but to no avail. i am calling the optimizer like this: x, loss, info = optimize.fmin_l_bfgs_b func=loss_grad, x0=np.asfortranarray x0 the code runs normally with later versions of scipy and python 3. any ideas?
