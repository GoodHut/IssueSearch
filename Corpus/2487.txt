 URL : "https://github.com/stumash/CoursePlanner/issues/102" TITLE : add travis ci BODY : in order to avoid having to run our deploy scripts each time we make a new change to the master branch, we should setup some continuous integration to do this job for us. travis ci https://travis-ci.org/ can accomplish this for us with the added benefit of integrating with github, indicating whether any given commit causes the project build to fail bad exit code from any deploy script and preventing the merging of failing branches into master .
