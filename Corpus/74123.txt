 URL : "https://github.com/StraboSpot/strabo-arcgis-plugin/issues/4" TITLE : download/upload tag info BODY : currently, download and upload code does not include tag info since that is contained in the strabo project geojson instead of the dataset. need to add a download of the geojson from projects and parse through to add to the esri json created. then, need to add a separation of tag info from the other dataset info in the esri json features to json and parse for any changes upon upload.
