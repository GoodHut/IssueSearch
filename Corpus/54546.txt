 URL : "https://github.com/pquerna/ffjson/issues/227" TITLE : go simple improvements BODY : i ran gosimple https://github.com/dominikh/go-tools/tree/master/cmd/gosimple recently, and found opportunities for improvements in ffjson generated files. - should omit comparison to bool constant https://staticcheck.io/docs/gosimple s1002 - should use bytes.equal instead of bytes.compare https://staticcheck.io/docs/gosimple s1004 - should simplify make calls https://staticcheck.io/docs/gosimple s1019 making these improvements should help to slightly reduce overall size of the generated files, and may offer some modest speedups as well
