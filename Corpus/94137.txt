 URL : "https://github.com/nutti/Magic-UV/issues/63" TITLE : box mapping fails at bevel BODY : i'm using unstable version 4.5. box mapping seems to work great, but it fails with bevels. in my test case, horizontal bevel looks fine, but vertical is strange. ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18626157/30510085-83eaa088-9ac6-11e7-97a8-8aa7d1eb5a5c.png ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18626157/30510090-94493bf6-9ac6-11e7-92bf-71e8fb5a822b.png steps to reproduce: 1. create a cube 2. create a window hole, all 90 degree angles 3. add bevel to the four edges of the window hole 4. box map with magic uv for some reason, appearance of this bug is inconsistent. sometimes i need to add a wall and a bevel to the other side of the window hole too, and then the bug appears.
