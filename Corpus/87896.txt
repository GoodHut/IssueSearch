 URL : "https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites/issues/10517" TITLE : menu: white-space: nowrap BODY : what would be the reason for .menu a { white-space: nowrap } ? seems pretty rigorous to have this in place on all menus. i guess it'd make sense in fully horizontal menus but not in accordion or other vertical navs.
