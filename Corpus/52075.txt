 URL : "https://github.com/danpros/htmly/issues/310" TITLE : can't make image posts BODY : hi, i noticed this problem yesterday. from the add content page, clicking on every content type opens the page to let me add content except for the image post content type. if i click on it, the browser will keep trying to load the page without any success until it times out. i tried it on different browsers and have cleared the cache but the problem persists. what could be causing this issue?
