 URL : "https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/issues/454" TITLE : del key not working on ssh BODY : i'm having a strange behavior and couldn't figure out what is going on. if i ssh to some machines from within alacritty the del key stops working on the shell, but works on vim. using another terminal i've tried with qterminal and xterm everything works fine. i've tried to diff the difference from stty -a between the two terminals but found none. also played with bind and infocmp with no luck. finally i ran alacritty with debug enable and find out there is no difference between pressing a key local or remote. i'm using gentoo locally and both gentoo and ubuntu remotely. what puzzles me most is that it works in some ubunto and gentoos, but doesn't on another. do you have any advice pin this down?
