 URL : "https://github.com/crsh/papaja/issues/103" TITLE : unicode output in latex BODY : hi, in the markdown file, i tried output a data frame from r chunk. in the data frame there not non-ascii characters. so when compiling to pdf, it throws this following error. i google a bit and it seems that maybe changing the latex engine would help? so i was wondering if there's any way to deal with this problem, and how to change the default latex_engine for papaj::apa6_pdf? also, if i set the output to be papaja::apa_word, everything works fine. million thanks in advance for the help! alvin > ! package inputenc error: unicode char 南 u+5357 > inputenc not set up for use with latex. > > see the inputenc package documentation for explanation. > type h <return> for immediate help. > ... > > l.900 001-01 & 6 & 4 & 南 > > try running pandoc with --latex-engine=xelatex. > pandoc: error producing pdf > error: pandoc document conversion failed with error 43 > in addition: warning message: > in has_utility convert , imagemagick : > imagemagick not installed or not in path > execution halted
