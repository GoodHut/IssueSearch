 URL : "https://github.com/belathus/Wanderlust-Renewed/issues/116" TITLE : thermal expansion fuels BODY : each of the reactant dynamo, magmatic dynamo, and compression dynamo can have fluids added to their fuel list. available possible fuels include canola oil, empowered oil, crystallized oil, ethanol, biodiesel, hooch, fire water, hydrogen, rocket fuel, and syngas. we could also add fuels to the reactant dynamo like honey, poison, blood, or life essence. we even have antimatter as a possible choice. for a mostly up-to-date list of fluids, check here https://github.com/belathus/wanderlust-renewed/wiki/liquid-list . also, this https://github.com/belathus/wanderlust-renewed/blob/master/config/cofh/thermalexpansion/fuels.cfg is the file i'd be editing. i'll list the available fuels below: compression dynamo coal : 500,000. liquifacted coal fuel : 2,000,000 buildcraft's fuel/gasoline refined oil : 1,250,000 no idea tree oil : 1,000,000 no idea magmatic lava : 180,000 pyrotheum : 2,000,000 reactant dynamo aerotheum : 1,250,000 biomass : 450,000 forestry; not ethanol creosote : 250,000 immersive engineering glowstone : 600,000 energized glowstone mobessence : 500,000 mfr redstone : 500,000 destabilized redstone seedoil : 250,000 forestry sewage : 24,000 mfr sludge : 24,000 mfr
