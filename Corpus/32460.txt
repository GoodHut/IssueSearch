 URL : "https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/issues/627" TITLE : use newtype pattern BODY : i was looking into this library and noticed it doesn't use newtype pattern. this makes it easily possible to accidentally swap uid_t , gid_t , pid_t and i suppose other s too. i've experienced such bugs in practice. i'd suggest using newtypes like uid , gid , pid in all interfaces and provide conversion functions impl from<uid> for uid_t such change would minimise chance of someone accidentally swapping those and potentially creating security vulnerability . i'd also suggest const root: uid = uid 0 ; .
