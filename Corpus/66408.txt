 URL : "https://github.com/shaih/HElib/issues/152" TITLE : modify plaintext length BODY : hi all, i am playing around with the helib project. i wanted to know if it is easily possible to generate random plaintextarrays with different array lengths. my goal is to check if there are runtime differences in using different plaintext lengths. even after looking deeper in the code i could not find a suitable solution. thanks in advance joflv
