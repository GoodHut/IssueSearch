 URL : "https://github.com/Terasology/AdditionalRails/issues/12" TITLE : new rail type: blocker BODY : features: the rail would stop a cart indefinitely or for a certain period of time. an nui screen that comes up when the user interacts with the rail could allow the user to change various options such as: - whether to stop carts indefinitely or delay them - if delaying, the length of the delay - whether to reverse carts' direction when releasing them - whether to send a signal when a cart is blocked or released - whether to release carts when receiving a signal it would be nice if the rail could show how much time is left by changing its appearance tile . implementation: the core feature could be implemented by saving the references and velocities of all carts passing over the rails in a way similar to how boosterrail and onewayboosterrail save their carts , setting their velocity to 0 and setting it to the original velocity when releasing them. delaying could be achieved with delaymanager or updatesubscribersystem. possible uses: - preventing collisions at intersections - making train stops - linking a certain number of carts together automatically if such a feature is added in the future needed modules: signalling for sending and responding to signals.
