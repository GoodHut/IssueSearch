 URL : "https://github.com/uNetworking/uTT/issues/3" TITLE : add debugging logging? BODY : i noticed a few commented out std::cout statements in broker.cpp for example https://github.com/unetworking/utt/blob/master/src/broker.cpp l47 //std::cout << protocollevel: << protocollevel << std::endl; would it be possible to add debugging logging functionality? i can imagine someone developing a client or server application would like this verbose output.
