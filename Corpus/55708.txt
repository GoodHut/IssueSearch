BODY : hello, i'm working on a project that visualizes some metrics data, and i'd like to use metricsgraphics, but it looks to be lacking a critical feature. i need to be able to plot up to 4 different series of data in a chart, but some of the data has very large y-axis numbers i.e. a value of 1,000,000 while other metrics would be much smaller i.e a value of 1 or 5 . when plotting these measures on the same y-axis scale the series with large numbers looks fine, but the series with smaller values just looks like a flat line. in other charting libraries i.e. ggplot2, d3 i have had the ability to use a different scale for each series and render those scales on the left and right side of the chart. as far as i can tell i cannot do this with metricsgraphics, but please correct me if i am wrong. if it currently is not possible, is this a feature that you would be willing to add to metricsgraphics? if so, i may be willing to do it, but it would be helpful to have someone point me in the right direction. thanks, alan
