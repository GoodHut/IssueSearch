 URL : "https://github.com/digitalbazaar/bedrock-angular-form/issues/21" TITLE : forms without the grid BODY : as we move away from bootstrap in the next major release... we have a common pattern of using col-xx-offset-xx classes on forms. what will be the replacement? same question goes for how we will be controlling the width of forms and elements without a grid. since labels and fields are not longer in columns in material, we don't need to be concerned about that. but we do need to align fields in one or more columns.
