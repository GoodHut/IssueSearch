 URL : "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/issues/928" TITLE : permissions as a request BODY : i think a flatpaked application should never get permissions before asking the user. reasons why i think this is important: - if for some reason a flatpak gets started e.g.: the user makes a mistake , a malicious flatpak could do its bad things - if the user doesn't know what permissions are granted, the flatpaked app could do things the user don't want to. so my proposal: - every gui application should list the permissions before installing - maybe there could be a possibility to switch permissions on/off - as soon as a application tries to access a permission there should be a pop up asking for it. android style - the cli should have a distinguish command for listing granting and revoking permissions: flatpak permissions grant|revoke|list what do you guys think about that? ps: there should be a network permission lan yes|no , internet yes|no
