 URL : "https://github.com/ev3dev/ev3dev/issues/912" TITLE : swift for ev3dev BODY : now that swift is officially embraced by lego, is there any plans for ev3dev to support it? i know a lot of people who love swift and want to use it for either teaching or for their own amusement. it would be a great addition and a logical next step for language adoption, i think. üôè
