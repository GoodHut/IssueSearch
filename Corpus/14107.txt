 URL : "https://github.com/nuxsmin/sysPass/issues/730" TITLE : add composer file BODY : currently there is no release on packagist for composer. it would be good to have one so we can install and update it with composer if possible . also a short git clone information would have been useful as the gitignore file does not overwrite the critical files but this method is not mentioned in the docs.
