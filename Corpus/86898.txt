 URL : "https://github.com/RPi-Distro/python-gpiozero/issues/535" TITLE : incomplete source tarball BODY : the source tarball released on pypi is incomplete due to some important files missing in manifest.in. most importantly, licence.txt is missing, which is a violation of the license itself under point 1 of the 3-clause bsd license. the source tarball thus is alcking all means of determining what license the source is published under, as the trove classifeier bsd license is more than ambigious. please fix manifest.in to build complete source tarballs in the future. please also include the changelog and, if possible, pg-sign the upload to pypi.
