 URL : "https://github.com/servo/rust-bindgen/issues/803" TITLE : tutorial is outdated BODY : the tutorial doesn't point to the latest bindgen release on crates.io: https://github.com/servo/rust-bindgen/blob/master/book/src/tutorial-1.md also it would be nice if it could be regenerated and re-uploaded to https://servo.github.io/rust-bindgen because the current version still has no_unstable_rust cc 757 .
