 URL : "https://github.com/ahmedkaludi/accelerated-mobile-pages/issues/1064" TITLE : textarea for body tag? BODY : should we add a text area for body tag as well? like the way, we are adding it for header and footer. reason: according to amp-auto-ads, the ad code should be immediately after the body. so if user wants to add the auto ads they have to use the hook from 1059 is text area a better solution or there's another workaround?
