 URL : "https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/688" TITLE : fyi: psi4 license change BODY : since psi4: is primarily a shared library / python module to c++/py folks, respectively rather than an executable bin/psi4 is light script loading python module ; is not necessarily at the top of the call stack, and we've heard from projects who would like to import us; is benefiting from the non-attaching and permissive licenses of numerous external projects to supplement psi4's capabilities, and we want to return the favor, we plan to change our license from gpl-2.0+ to lgpl-3.0+, effective by the the 1.1 release. the current and historical core developers have signed off on this. the historical peripheral developers are discussing this without any initial objections. we now want to get feedback from the github contributor, user, and packaging community or anyone not in e-mail communication with the core developers . so please reply with any concerns, constraints, preferences, etc. dependencies licensing situation required library dependencies current & anticipated : psfl, lgpl-3.0+, bsd-3-clause-lbnl, bsd-3-clause optional library dependencies: bsd-2-clause, bsd-3-clause, gpl-2.0+, lgpl-3.0+ optional executable dependencies: gpl-1.0+, custom psi4 plugins: gpl-2.0+, gpl-3.0+ conda-wise, we'll build an alternate conda package that doesn't link any gpl libraries or plugins queries psi4 is a python module and hence a dynamic library. i don't know right off how to even build a psi4.a . with that in mind, does anyone care about license terms for static linking? any concrete problems that would be solved by a permissive license instead of lgpl? anyone care about sublicensing?
