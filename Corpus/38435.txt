BODY : hello, i'd like to add julia-mode to guix. a guix package is typically defined using the last released version though an arbitrary commit can be used if necessary . looking through the repo history, the version was set to 0.3 in 6105b93 header improvements to conform to melpa's standards., 2014-08-12 and has not been updated since. are there any plans to tag a release? thanks.
