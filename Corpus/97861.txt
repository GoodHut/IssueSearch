 URL : "https://github.com/gnunn1/terminix/issues/703" TITLE : huge image as a background BODY : comparing to xfce4-terminal, terminix seems to be consuming much more memory for a background image. for example, this image https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:lro_tycho_central_peak.jpg 21,467 × 9,860 pixels, file size: 42.3 mb takes about 1 gb of ram in terminix and only about 660 mb in xfce4-terminal. an even bigger image https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:in_the_conservatory.jpg 30,000 × 22,943 pixels, file size: 172.7 mb gets terminix killed by oom guard on my machine with 8 gb of ram, but xfce4-terminal can handle it taking about 2 gb of ram. i was measure ram usage by running htop and looking at res column.
