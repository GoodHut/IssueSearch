 URL : "https://github.com/opencast/pyCA/issues/144" TITLE : implement systemd notify BODY : https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sdnotify i would like to see pyca communicate with systemd via notifications, so that we can leverage the systemd watchdog. sometimes, some processes will hang themselves, which is unacceptable in a production environment. if pyca would use sdnotify, we could change the service type to notify and set a watchdog that is about twice of the default check intervall and send a notification on every control loop iteration. a stuck worker would then be forcefully restarted by systemd, ensuring that the basic functionionality will work. of course this is much harder to do on the capture worker - i would leave this out for now.
