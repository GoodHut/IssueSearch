 URL : "https://github.com/lucasart/Demolito/issues/75" TITLE : port to c11 BODY : this would reduce compilation time, improve portability, and produce smaller binaries. also would ensure nothing is hidden from sight, and to be read between the lines. i'd also like to try musl. there's some extra pain, as we lose niceties like namespaces, string, stringstream, getline, threads.h not yet supported by glibc , templates can be done in c by ab using the preprocessor .
