 URL : "https://github.com/bencoveney/barrelsby/issues/20" TITLE : allow custom builders BODY : maybe quite a large undertaking... there are currently 2 different barrel builders and adding alternate ones requires changes to the barrelsby library. this would be a problem for anyone using different linting rules or coding styles. it would be good to allow people to specify their own barrel building logic similar to how tslint allows you to specify custom formatters. i think this would require the following: - work out the interface for a builder function for example input parameters and output format - port existing barrels to implement the new builder interface - add a config option to allow the custom builder to be specified via a path? - add documentation on how to create a builder function - ensure all utility functions used by the current builders are bundled up nicely so that people can reuse them easily
