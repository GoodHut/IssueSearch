 URL : "https://github.com/udacity/robotics-nanodegree-issues/issues/2" TITLE : radio button colors BODY : hello, radio button colors and input text box colors are very close to the background color of udacity class pages. i am finding it quite a bit difficult to distinguish various fields and their corresponding options in udacity quizzes. could you please differentiate the above fields a bit more so it becomes easier? i have tried two monitors and i faced the issue using both. thanks.
