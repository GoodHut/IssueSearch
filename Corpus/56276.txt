 URL : "https://github.com/Volafile/volafile-bugs/issues/203" TITLE : modlog broken/too wide BODY : str: - bl a file with a long name - trigger bl so a new log entry is generated result: mod log table becomes to wide, overflows off screen truncated ; the breakword class does not actually work suggested fix: --- using table-layout: fixed would do it, but then you need to also either manually set width on the first table row cells th in this case or do so in css dolosfile works around this now by: css .page_admin_modlog table { table-layout: fixed; width: 100%; } .page_admin_modlog table th:nth-child 1 { width: 15%; } .page_admin_modlog table th:nth-child 3 { width: 62%; } .page_admin_modlog table th:nth-child 4 { width: 7ex; }
