 URL : "https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/870" TITLE : vv10 correction usage BODY : i would like to use the vv10 kernel with custom parameters to use it in the dft-nl fashion http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/ct200644w . one needs to modify the b and c parameters. i figured out that those are obtained from libxc in libxcfunctional.cc . i suppose that within libxcfunctional::build_worker one has to add a user-tweak somehow to modify the vv10 parameters. so to the actual questions: - can i already request the vv10 kernel to be included for a given functional through the python interface? parameters aside - can i already request the vv10 kernel in a post-scf fashion for a given density a non-scf vv10 is perfectly fine for energies, it is the default in orca . i think i saw this mentioned somewhere, but cannot find it. - any further helpful pointers to within code where i would need to make changes or need to take a look? i am more a fortran than c++ guy, my head hurts already
