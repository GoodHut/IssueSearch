BODY : i have created attributes for my products and want to be able to filter them on specific pages through the block. so, say i have 6 checkbox attributes and want to sort based on one of those, i could select sort by -> attribute -> is checked. it would be nice to be able to pick multiple attributes so you can make custom filters or even have some kind of drag and drop filter maker with conditionals and booleans. i assume one can do this programmatically of course, but it would be cool to have some basic functionality in the block.
