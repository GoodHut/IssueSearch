 URL : "https://github.com/JGCRI/hector/issues/170" TITLE : merge fixes - fyi BODY : hi @cahartin and @bvegawe - well, i'm not sure how it went awry but you'll see i've made a couple commits to your dev_doeclim branch that straighten things out: at this point the branch is fully updated against master . also, on the master side, i've removed dev_doeclim from the travis build, because i don't want to be getting emails every time that branch breaks : if you want to enable testing, it should be straightforward to do within your branch. let me know if you have any questions.
