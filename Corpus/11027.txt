 URL : "https://github.com/ldd/fantasy-map-generator/issues/2" TITLE : example with svg BODY : i'm a canvas noob - could you add an example to the readme showing how to create an svg element that i could pass in to drawmap ? i tried just tossing <svg id= map ></svg> into my body, but passing the element in to drawmap resulted in uncaught typeerror: svg.selectall is not a function at drawpaths view.js:126 at object.drawmap visualize.js:20 at index :16 which i'm pretty sure is the result of me not knowing what i'm doing.
