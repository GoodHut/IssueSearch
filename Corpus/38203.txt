 URL : "https://github.com/MarimerLLC/cslaforum/issues/383" TITLE : old forum going down BODY : hello everyone, i am sad to say that the old archived forum forum.lhotka.net needs to go away asap. it is running on a 32 bit windows 2003 server and so is vulnerable to this latest virus running around the world. and it can't be upgraded because it is 32 bit. my current plan is to dump all the data out of the sql server db and shut down the vm. exactly what to do with the data from the database is unknown at this point, but at least i'll still have a copy in case someone wants to figure out a way to put it back online in some form.
