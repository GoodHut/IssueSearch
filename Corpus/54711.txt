 URL : "https://github.com/i-rinat/freshplayerplugin/issues/355" TITLE : help with drm playback BODY : this request for help has nothing to do with this project, i only think this might be the best place to get help. i got libpepflashplayer.so from one of the chrome os recovery images. it is version 24.0.0.221 which is the latest version at the moment and it still has drm support: strings -a /usr/lib/pepperflash/libpepflashplayer.so | grep ppb_flash_drm ppb_flash_drm;1.1 ppb_flash_drm;1.0 i am using it together with chromium: chromium --ppapi-flash-path=/usr/lib/pepperflash/libpepflashplayer.so regular flash content works without any issue. drm does not, i am testing drm like this: - go to _http://drmtest2.adobe.com:8080/svp/samplevideoplayer_fp.html_ - use _http://drmtest2.adobe.com:8080/content/anonymous.f4v_ as input video url the error i see in the console, i started the browser from is: 5772:5772:0310/192435.591968:error:device_id_fetcher.cc 143 empty machine id _/etc/machine-id_ and _/var/lib/dbus/machine-id_ exist, i even installed _hal-flash_ as a last resort. any help would be appreciated.
