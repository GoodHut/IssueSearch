BODY : sorry for writing this as an issue, but i found no other way to contact. i really like this solution for creating local web apps, but i wonder if will continue working in the future or not. as far as i understand, chrome for non-chromebooks will stop support apps in early 2018. is applicationize affected by this? if so, can the problem be solved? source: https://blog.chromium.org/2016/08/from-chrome-apps-to-web.html
