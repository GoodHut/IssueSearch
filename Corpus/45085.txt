 URL : "https://github.com/TI-Tokyo/riak-community-admin/issues/9" TITLE : groups and teams list BODY : in paragraph 3, there is an example stating that a team might deal with writing source code for riak core, and would therefore not deal with writing source code for riak kv although i have no problem with this concept, to the casual observer with only light knowledge of riak read corporate decision maker , core is a part of kv and should therefore mean that any changes with core cause changes in kv therefore changing core's source code can cause changes in kv's source code, so the core team is indirectly changing kv's source code ... my head hurts. instead of this, recommend two things that are more clearly separated to avoid any risk of confusion at this early point of the document e.g. cs and kv or core and the java client libraries
