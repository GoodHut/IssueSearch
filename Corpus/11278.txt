 URL : "https://github.com/beaufortfrancois/spotify-hotkeys-chrome-extension/issues/17" TITLE : function to save BODY : francois, i have the version 0.5.2 and everything work except the save playlist. i am not a user of your extension but i wrote a c application for a blind guy in canada quebec . my c application uses direct internet link to select the playlist, it controls the mouse to activate the play button and it uses your extension to stop/play/next/. it would be great if you could fix the save function. i do not know how many people use your application but i know for sure that it makes a big difference for someone in quebec. http://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/723937/francois-fournier-brulures-aveugle-survivant merci beaucoup...
