 URL : "https://github.com/jdufresne/privateurls/issues/1" TITLE : two simple questions BODY : hi, two simple questions: 1 is it possible to add to privateurls other functions like url-tracking-cleaning , redirecting , skipping etc? if not, why do we need two add-ons for that? please, does anybody know an add-on all-in-one , tracking cleaning & redirecting/skipping urls? 2 some antitracking/skip/redirect add-ons are around or even less than 10 kib size, with minimum system performance impact. does add-on size/performance depend on quantity of rules/blocking or redirecting capabilities? thank you!
