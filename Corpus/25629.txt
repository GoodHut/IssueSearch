 URL : "https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/issues/3140" TITLE : 404 at /datacenter/ BODY : url: /datacenter/ suggested improvement to the doc tree for ee products given that ucp & dtr docs are at these urls: https://docs.docker.com/datacenter/ucp/2.1/guides/ and https://docs.docker.com/datacenter/dtr/2.2/guides/ : it would be nice to fill out the intermediate links so they don't return 404s. people somewhat expect the intermediate links on the way to deep links to be populated with data. clearly someone had some organization in mind when creating the link structure, so use the force , as they say. that is, - list all the datacenter products on https://docs.docker.com/datacenter , e.g. ucp and dtr, with links to the lower level product specific page - for each product page, list each of the versions available, e.g. on https://docs.docker.com/datacenter/ucp, list 2.0, 2.1, etc. - keep the doc trees for older versions - if there is some other material than guides on the level of an individual release, list it on the version page. otherwise, get rid of the intermediate link to guides
