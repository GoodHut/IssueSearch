 URL : "https://github.com/cristijora/vue-form-wizard/issues/48" TITLE : disable everything on load BODY : hello, i just wanted to ask the best way of loading the form with disabled fields and next step button and have an 'edit' button to enable all the fields? the scenario is that if multiple users have opened the same record at a time one user should be able to edit the record and fires off an event to notify the others that the record is currently on edit mode. thanks!
