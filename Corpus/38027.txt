 URL : "https://github.com/unicode-table/unicode-table-data/issues/51" TITLE : no licence specified BODY : i searched through the repo and looked at the wiki and couldn't find any licensing information. afaik, under most law systems, not specifying any licensing info == all rights reserved . this makes it rather problematic for people who'd like to use the data found here for their own projects.
