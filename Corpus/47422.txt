 URL : "https://github.com/skiselkov/BetterPushbackC/issues/151" TITLE : pause during pushback BODY : hello i quite enjoy your add-on. this is one of the better push back out there that i have ever seen in x-plane. i want to request a new feature for this add-on. during push back or tow the aircraft, you should have an option in order to pause the push back. reason being that some aircraft has higher priority than you and they can push out first before you can push or they need to hold short of taxiway before continue towing anyway, keep up the good work.
