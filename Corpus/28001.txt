 URL : "https://github.com/impressivewebs/HTML9-Responsive-Boilerstrap-js/issues/147" TITLE : exactly 1,337 stars BODY : ! 1337 stars https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/669103/27083348-8da4ed22-5048-11e7-8240-c875555a6200.png as shown in the screenshot, the repo currently has 1,337 stars. as this number is associated with toxic hacker culture which is in direct opposition to the code of conduct , i believe this reflects badly on the project. please ask a friend or family member to star the repo so the number is increased by 1, thank.
