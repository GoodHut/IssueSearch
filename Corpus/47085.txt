 URL : "https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan-shim/issues/3" TITLE : non working exclusion BODY : the file directory exclusion by excludes_analyse is not working in phar-ed version of phpstan 0.7 . the files in excluded directories are still scanned and reported. this works fine in normal version 0.7 and ./vendor/phpstan/phpstan/bin/phpstan : parameters: excludes_analyse: - %rootdir%/../../../src/component/foo/tests/ i'd expect that %rootdir%/../src/component/foo/tests/ will work for phar-ed version because it resides in ./bin/phpstan.phar .
