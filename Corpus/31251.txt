 URL : "https://github.com/SurveyMonkey/surveymonkey-android-sdk/issues/32" TITLE : sdk resonse failure BODY : it has been noticed that there is a frequent failure in reporting the response. while checking in surveymonkey, all the response of the user us recorded but the sdk fails to provide success response to our app. it creates difference in report generated from two different platforms. as we pay users for every successful completion, when survey monkey does not send us successful response, users are deprived of their benefit which is creating dissatisfaction among our users. we are the platinum user of survey monkey. username: chekea please look into it asap. thanks
