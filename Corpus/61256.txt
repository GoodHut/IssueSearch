BODY : i'm testing the charts again and there is something odd about cloud coverage. at the present time, it is cloud less, not a single one in sight. the report shows: { rain : false, readingtimestamp : 2017-08-22 09:13:38 , outsidetemp : 24.77, skytemp : 14.79} the code is: def _calculate_cloud_cover self, sky, ambient : ''' needs work. +22ambient and -2.5sky and sky was 90% clear :param sky: :param ambient: :return: ''' cc = sky+20 7 -ambient if cc > 100: cc = 100 if cc < 10: cc = 0 return cc so from the above report: cc= 14.79+20 7 -24.77 cc= 218.76 cc > 100 so it's cloudy but it's not cloudy out there right now, blue sky.
