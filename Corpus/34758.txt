submission from: n032252.cs.kun.nl 131.174.32.252 1. bind a directory with something like -r . corn'' when editting a file in
coqide coqide -r . corn algebra/cordfields.v in coqide run print loadpath. if the file algebra/cordfields.vo exists then the load path is proper.
if the file algebra/cordfields.vo does not exist then the path .../corn/algebra <none> is unbound as you can see. this is bad. .../corn/algebra should remain bound
correctly whether cordfields.vo exists or not. bugzilla comment id: 1013
