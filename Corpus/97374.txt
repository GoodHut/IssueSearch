 URL : "https://github.com/nightsense/vimspectr/issues/3" TITLE : git diffs use wrong colors BODY : this is using vimspectr60flat-dark… i guess because it's all automagically defined, there are some overlaps. one very important aspect of a colorscheme to me is that the diffs are relatively traditionally defined… green-ish for addition, red-ish for deletion, yellow-ish for modified. i suppose i can add custom variables for it, but i thought i'd bring it to your attention. thanks for such a neat project, i do like it quite a lot so far. <img width= 726 alt= screen shot 2017-11-27 at 5 54 27 am src= https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62209/33265464-7809a9f4-d337-11e7-802c-a6e8165030f6.png >
