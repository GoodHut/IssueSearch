 URL : "https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/crispy-doom/issues/145" TITLE : port over doombsp/idbsp BODY : currently, crispy uses the internal blockmap builder from mbf, which does its job just fine, but creates entirely different blockmaps than e.g. the ones used in the iwads. this means that any demo will desync early if run with the -blockmap parameter. now that the sources for doombsp have been released https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/utils/level_edit/node_builders/doombsp i plan on porting its blockmap code to plain c, remove the blockmap limit and add support for flipped levels and use as a replacement for mbf's blockmap builder. this is a long-term gaol and might not even get finished or even started at any time in the near future.
