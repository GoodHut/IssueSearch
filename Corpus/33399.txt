 URL : "https://github.com/deltabeard/ctrmus/issues/17" TITLE : add mp3 file support BODY : it's inferior to opus as a lossy codec, but it is still very common. according to this article http://www.wezm.net/technical/2008/04/mp3-decoder-libraries-compared/ libmpg123 is faster than libmad, but libmad has already been added to 3ds-portlibs. an attempt should be made to compile and use libmpg123 before using libmad as it is faster, and seems to be able to output 16 bit pcm audio directly . libmad outputs 24 bit pcm, which will then require processing to reduce to 16 pcm - if my understanding is correct. the dsp module can only play 16 bit pcm.
