 URL : "https://github.com/xonsh/xonsh/issues/2179" TITLE : procproxy does not work BODY : with following code in xonshrc: def foo : return banana for scale. foo.__xonsh_threadable__ = false aliases 'ffoo' = foo then run $ ffoo it will stuck. and is there any other built-in alias using procproxy , which i think should also have this issue? p.s. another thing i notice that i cannot name this alias to foo , it will be the function object, rather than a alias call.
