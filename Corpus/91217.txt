 URL : "https://github.com/chrmarti/testissues/issues/736" TITLE : tasks: multi root support BODY : this issue is for discussing the future of tasks in a multi-root environment. i see two interesting places where today a single root is assumed there may be more i am not aware of : when resolving the tasks configuration getconfiguration https://github-com/microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/parts/tasks/electron-browser/task.contribution.ts!l1279 when detecting tasks from files such as gulpfile.js processrunnerdetector https://github-com/microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/parts/tasks/node/processrunnerdetector.ts!l118 iworkspacecontextservice.toresource and getworkspace are deprecated in favour of iworkspacecontextservice.getworkspace2 that contains information about all the roots. we need to decide for tasks and debug if we just collect tasks from all workspaces or introduce a different concept to make this decision.
