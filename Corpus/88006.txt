the example where the problems can be seen i used coq from svn:
url: svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/coq/branches/v8.3
check out time: 02 jun 2010 06:28 pm well probably few minutes earlier than that when trying to define a functional scheme before obligations are resolved i get error message: anomaly: . please report. see the attached file to reproduce the problem. also when you remove require import program. and modify the signature of treebind to: function treebind a b : type f : a -> ttreefn b m : ttreefn a {measure gettreefnsize m} : ttreefn b then you get this error message: error: no such section variable or assumption: treebind. which does not make sense to me.
if the list argument cs is moved to the left of the arrow then treebind can be accepted as function in coq and there is no error message . > attached file: test.v text/plain, 1385 bytes > description: the example where the problems can be seen bugzilla comment id: 3544

from: @_herbelin actually the bug can be triggered in a much simpler way. the line functional scheme foo_ind := induction for foo sort prop. raises an anomaly in 8.2, 8.3 and trunk whenever foo does not exist. bugzilla comment id: 3688

from: @_matafou this is fixed in v8.3 and trunk.
