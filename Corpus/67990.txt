 URL : "https://github.com/jdorn/json-editor/issues/775" TITLE : recursive schema issues BODY : hi, i'm trying to use your editor for following schema https://paste.scratchbook.ch/view/c913aac5. editor says that schema is valid, and suggest me to edit object1 or condition instead of response and condition. if add more dependencies for child nodes see https://paste.scratchbook.ch/view/5ab6f630 then schema is valid again, but editor doesn't understand that schema at all. what i'm doing wrong?
