 URL : "https://github.com/nypublicradio/audiogram/issues/98" TITLE : forking on the worker? BODY : one way to reduce the 80% processing time on a single job would be to somehow use node's child_process capabilities on the step that draws individual images for each frame. that would work great on a multicore machine. have you guys thought or have any ideas on how audiogram/draw-frames.js could be modified to take advantage of forking?
