 URL : "https://github.com/aspnet/Localization/issues/341" TITLE : use caching apis BODY : i'm still wondering why we didn't use the caching apis that available in asp.net core instead of creating new apis that doing the exact same thing. imho memory caching will be an equivalent to what's available now for caching the resource names, missing resources .. etc /cc @eilon @ryanbrandenburg
