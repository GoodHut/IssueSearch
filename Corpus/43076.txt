 URL : "https://github.com/fcrepo/fcrepo-specification/issues/249" TITLE : clarify ldprm general BODY : re https://fcrepo.github.io/fcrepo-specification/ ldprm-general it is created as both an ldpr and a memento -- should ldpr be ldprv ? in an ldprm must be invariant: while it may be deleted, it must not be modified once created. the must be invariant is not particularly testable. it may be simpler to just say an ldprm may be deleted, but must not be modified once created.
