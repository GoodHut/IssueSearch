 URL : "https://github.com/stephanmax/grunt-responsive-images-extender/issues/17" TITLE : affects html output BODY : it seems that plugin affects html output far beyond just adding srcsets. for instance, it changes html quotes: html <div class='test'></div> to html <div class= test ></div> also, it affects inner whitespacing: html <div class= test ></div> becomes <div class= test ></div> while issue with whitespace doesn't seem to be serious though, it make git comparison show a lot of unintended changes , changes of quotes actually is a serious issue, because it will break following case: html <div data-settings='{ id :9089}'></div> result will be html <div data-settings= { id :9089} ></div> which effectively makes html wrong.
