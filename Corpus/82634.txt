 URL : "https://github.com/CliffordAnderson/XQuery4Humanists/issues/5" TITLE : alternative lookup syntax BODY : hi cliff, in 03, around line 470, there's this paragraph: > the extra work of finding the size of the array and iterating through its members is actually not necessary when we use the alternative lookup syntax. can you rewrite this example with the lookup syntax? i wasn't exactly sure what you meant by alternative lookup syntax. did you mean the ? lookup operator? are you asking the student to write out a more verbose path rather than use map:find ? joe
