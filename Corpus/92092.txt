 URL : "https://github.com/5calls/5calls/issues/170" TITLE : utm parameter breaks site BODY : when including a utm parameter for ga campaign tracking, the application persists this parameter in the url and subsequently breaks site navigation. to reproduce: 1. go to: https://5calls.org/?utm_campaign=test 2. click on an issue 3. subsequent url will look like: https://5calls.org/?utm_campaign=test issue/recswqdicerreoudc this is incorrect, as the site should not persist the utm_campaign parameter in the url after the first call. and by remaining in the url, the site navigation does not work.
