 URL : "https://github.com/Contentify/Contentify/issues/127" TITLE : digital ocean installation BODY : hi, bit of a newbie to this so please excuse my ignorance. i've attempted to follow the installation guide and setup a lamp stack on digital ocean by following the video in the installation wiki but after installation the install.php page cannot be found. is there an additional setup that i've missed outside of this or is this now out of date? thanks.
