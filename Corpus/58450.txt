 URL : "https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues/5498" TITLE : single shared operator BODY : with rx2.x and single, i'm search for the equivalent of the shared operator from observable. from what i understand this operator doesn't exist for single, is there a reason for that ? my need is to shared a single that execute network call, i don't want to do x time that network call, just want to share the response when the network call is done. cache operator is not what i need as it will never do the network call again. if there multiple subscribe during a call just share the response of the first one, if not just execute the network call normally
