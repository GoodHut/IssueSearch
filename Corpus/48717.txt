 URL : "https://github.com/RaymondWillemsEpea/bambi/issues/13" TITLE : simple error overhaul BODY : background several simple to fix errors are identified. based on a comparison of the gui with the workbook this should be taken care of. examples are fields that do not exist in the workbook, fields with the wrong data type, fields with the wrong name, etc. this is under the assumption that multiple choices and connecting documents to fields will be fixed and implemented according to the workbook. these type of defects will occur in virtually any software development project and are rather easy to fix. functionality there is no system functionality with regards to this. solution two days will be planned where the three partners together with the developers go through and fix those small errors and cosmetic details. in light of the rather tight schedule it will be most efficient if the fixes are done directly in the session and verified immediately. a requirement for this to work is that the scope for this is clearly identified as suggested above and that the persons that actually will do the changes as well as those that have a good insight into how the system is intended to work are available the whole time. to prevent confusion about the scope of this item it is only containing things like: •	correcting labels in the gui the texts describing the fields and also headers separating them •	correcting default values for fields in the gui •	correcting field names •	correcting field data types – within the limits imposed by orient db and what is possible to implemented by swagger •	removing fields that should not be there •	adding fields that should be there 2 step correction: 1 correction of errors verification and send list of fieldnames 2 adaptations of fieldnames notes the last four bullet points listed above will require a corresponding change of the api and the gui.
