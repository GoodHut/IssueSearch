 URL : "https://github.com/neuropoly/spinalcordtoolbox/issues/1205" TITLE : create viewer for labeling BODY : based on sct_viewer , the interface would be used for labeling the vertebrae and intervertebral disks, as well as brainstem labels. the viewer would include a sagittal view on which clicks are required. the view would show the mid-sagittal plane, averaged over a few slices. the intervertebral disks would be labeled on posterior tip of the disk, while the c1 label =1 would be placed on the tip of the c1 vertebrae. the c1-c2 =2 would not be placed because its detection is not reliable. a label can be skipped using the space bar, and the left-right arrow of the keyboard can be used to go through the left-right direction.
