 URL : "https://github.com/galenframework/galen/issues/463" TITLE : identify dump errors BODY : i am currently working on a setup where i run check and dump during the same suite: regression ${pagename} for ${device} ${browser} selenium grid ${gridurl} --page ${url}${path} --size ${size} --dc.build ${tunnelidentifier} --dc.name galen regression on ${device} ${browser}: ${pagename} ${gridargs} --dc.tunnelidentifier ${tunnelidentifier} run test/visual/scripts/${preaction} check test/visual/specs/page.regression.gspec --vdevice ${device} --vpagename ${pagename} dump test/visual/specs/page.dump.gspec --name ${pagename}-${device} test --export test-output/visual/dump/pages/${pagename}/${device} this works. all checks are run and also a visual dump is created. the problem i am having with this however is that i am not able to differentiate between different errors. if either any of the checks or any dump fails galen will return a non-zero exit code. i am looking for a way to find out what went wrong. the json report contains information on whether or not any of the checks failed. what i am looking for is a way to determine if the dump failed. is there any way in which i could achieve this?
