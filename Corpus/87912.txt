 URL : "https://github.com/mndrix/sms-over-xmpp/issues/5" TITLE : message delivery receipts BODY : implement xep-0184 http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0184.html to respond to message delivery receipts. these receipts should be based on twilio's sms status info https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223134347-what-do-the-sms-statuses-mean- . that way, my xmpp client shows received only when we're certain that the sms has been delivered to a device.
