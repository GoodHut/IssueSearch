 URL : "https://github.com/milaq/rpi-rf/issues/14" TITLE : issue with make command BODY : hi all, i have encountered an error whilst trying to run rfsniffer using the make command. i've never edited anything in the rfsniffer.cpp script so it is left in the default settings. my error message: g++ -drpi -c -o rfsniffer.o rfsniffer.cpp rfsniffer.cpp:18:16: error: expected constructor, destructor, or type conversion before ‘ ’ token pullupdncontrol pin, pud_off ; ^ <builtin>: recipe for target 'rfsniffer.o' failed make: rfsniffer.o error 1 some help on what this exactly means would be greatly appreciated! i'm so close to getting it to sniff my codes that this is frustrating!
