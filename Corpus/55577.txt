 URL : "https://github.com/iNPUTmice/ComplianceTester/issues/100" TITLE : jitsi compliance suite BODY : this is very optional, but it would be nice to include it out of the box. right now, the only jitsi specific test i can think of is the presence of the video bridge component. i'll take a more detailed look later on this week to see if there are any others outside of the advanced client suite.
