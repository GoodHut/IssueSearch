 URL : "https://github.com/twitter/algebird/issues/615" TITLE : use algebra types more BODY : algebra and cats-kernel have many types we don't have in algebird. the main ones we should use are the ones for commutativity and idempotence. this will at least signal to users what properties those monoids/semigroups have. this will be useful for summingbird which now requires a user to explicitly communicate that.
