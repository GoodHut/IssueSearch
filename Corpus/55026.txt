 URL : "https://github.com/olivierkes/manuskript/issues/200" TITLE : ideas needed: importer BODY : the branch feature/importers has been created based on @camstevenson's work on opml import 192 . long life and prosperity to him ! i'll will now work on that branch to create an importer similar to the exporter. if i create only a markdown import, then using pandoc we can import all the formats listed here https://github.com/olivierkes/manuskript/wiki/import-and-export-capabilities . my current ideas are: - being able to preview the import by creating a temporary model, and showing the import in outline view / tree view / flash cards , before actually importing it. - having an option to create a scene split or folder split by string expression or regular expression so my questions for you: - what ideas do you have for the importer? what is necessary, what is to avoid? - how should a markdown document be imported? my current idea: - a title with subtitles in it is a folder - a title without subtitles is a scene thanks for your feedbacks :
