 URL : "https://github.com/sfackler/cargo-tree/issues/13" TITLE : sort cargo tree -d BODY : i have a crate that has transitive dependencies on both serde 0.9 and serde 0.8. i can run cargo tree -d to discover this. but sometimes serde 0.8 is shown before 0.9, sometimes after. i don't care whether the order is decreasing by version number or increasing by version number or something else but it should be consistent so that i can sanely diff the output before/after making a change to my cargo.toml.
