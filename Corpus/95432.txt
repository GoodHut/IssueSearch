 URL : "https://github.com/llllIHARWINDERIllll/AdiphyBot/issues/15" TITLE : d.i.y. no.... literally :p BODY : no more posts issues are needed to make @lllliharwinderillll aware that adiphy is now ratebuk considering that the adiphy,com domain is now parked - no longer forwarding - and literally nothing about ratebuk is different, i am just going to assume that there was a dispute with domain owner but who knows . @lllliharwinderillll may update the software to reflect this, but as of right now, since the backend is exactly the same, we can simply make our localhost think ratebuk.com is still located at the adiphy.com address. ðŸ˜± i spent a good 90mins trying to get a quick hack to work with windows' hosts file but either my code-fu is not good enough or the hosts file is even more limited in what it can do than i thought probably both . however, i believe i was able to extract a fully functioning adiphy.class file from the jar package; so one would only need to edit the very obvious url variables. i'm exhausted from today plus slightly miffed that the messy windows tempfix didn't work - although if you are running your own dns server then you know what to do but if no progress has been made by later this weekend i'll try my hand at it. https://gist.github.com/tonyrayo/b0396cc03d24590c3ffae5c0717c31ef
