 URL : "https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto/issues/96" TITLE : add in-toto-keygen utility BODY : currently in-toto provides some utility functions https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto/blob/develop/in_toto/util.py to create password encrypted rsa key pairs programatically. it would be nice to additionally have a command line utility, e.g. in-toto-keygen , for key creation like a stripped down ssh-keygen . keep in mind that we might want to drop the util module https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto/issues/80 at some point and move its updated functionality to securesystemslib/keys https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/securesystemslib/blob/master/securesystemslib/keys.py .
