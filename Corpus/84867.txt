 URL : "https://github.com/veraPDF/verapdf-crawler/issues/87" TITLE : domain name normalization BODY : at the moment strings like www.domain.com, domain.com, subdomain.domain.com are treated as individual jobs with independent results. this can lead to some data collisions since we use document url as a key of document tabel. we should: - investigate if www.domain.com and domain.com are treated as the same address in heritrix - for subdomains we can have independent heritrix jobs, but we should link them to already existing documents if they were downloaded and checked before within another job.
