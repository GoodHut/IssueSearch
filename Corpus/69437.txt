 URL : "https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate-core/issues/147" TITLE : temporal 1d gap filling BODY : for uc02 having the possibility to do a temporal 1d gap filling is desirable. it should probably just feature doing interpolation with the choice of multiple interpolation methods. it should be implemented in a way that would work with dask. e.g., reading the whole time-series in memory and doing something is probably not a great idea. a good approach is probably doing xr.dataarray.rolling over time and either manipulating the array in-place, or creating an auxiliary array that can then be used with xr.dataarrai.fillna .
