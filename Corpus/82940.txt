BODY : hey! first of all thanks for the awesome library ðŸŽ‰ i just wanted to ask if it would be possible to change batchupdate access level to public ? we use it quite often so in my swift 2.3 fork https://github.com/sunshinejr/diff.swift/tree/swift-2.3 i've made it public, but it might've been a bad idea considering i didn't ask if we can do the same for the main repo and the future transition from swift 2.3 to 3.x might be more problematic than needed :d if not i will just reverse the changes and include copy of the struct in the project, so no worries there : cheers!
