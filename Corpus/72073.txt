 URL : "https://github.com/square/sqldelight/issues/634" TITLE : auto generate index_name BODY : in order to remove indexes would be useful that sqldelight automatically generates each index_name created in the sq file. similarly as for views: some_index: create index index_1 on some_table some_column ; would additionally generate: string index_1_index_name = index_1 ; i could try to come up with a pr if this change makes sense.
