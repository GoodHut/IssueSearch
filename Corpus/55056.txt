 URL : "https://github.com/oliver-moran/jimp/issues/271" TITLE : image.hasalpha method? BODY : is it possible to add a method for determining if a png has a transparency colour channel? creating alpha channels when none is required results in unnecessarily large images. ideally, the following could be used: js image.rgba image.hasalpha ; this would either preserve the channel when used remove it when unecessary.
