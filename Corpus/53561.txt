 URL : "https://github.com/LPgenerator/mattermost_bot/issues/42" TITLE : elaboration on plugins BODY : so i know how i can take my own code and put it in front of the bot .run to have it work. but i can't figure out from your documentation how exactly plugins work. so if i create another python file with the code for responding to people, etc how is that loaded in? sorry if i'm just not seeing something. works for me other than figuring out how to use the plugins, i'm actually running it in docker atm by running python in the container against files i created locally ie mattermost_settings.py etc thanks
