BODY : it would be pretty cool if one could do a transition like the following: ! image https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1309249/26333273/a592b984-3f5c-11e7-8384-87b894d04566.png https://youtu.be/a88ta46djda https://youtu.be/a88ta46djda example using random footage, followed by schematic depiction of the transition as you can see, the transition clip c does not fully cover the screen to do a regular stinger transition at a certain frame at which everything is covered by the clip. instead, both a and b are visible during the transition. such a transition is not possible with one alpha channel in the transition clip, as the transparency information could only be used to blend in a or b, but not both. two alpha channels, one for a and another for b would be required. i'm not sure if any video format supports this however. it would probably be better if a second clip could be specified, containing only the second alpha channel. does anyone have a better approach to this? and is this feasible to program for obs?
