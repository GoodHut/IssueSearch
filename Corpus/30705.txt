 URL : "https://github.com/spyder-ide/pywinpty/issues/75" TITLE : python 2.7 support? BODY : given @sylvaincorlay's comment here https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/460 issuecomment-343332639 , i think we should resurrect https://github.com/spyder-ide/pywinpty/pull/66. we are relying on winpty to handle the memory alloc/dealloc, and we are not passing os primitives as described by @mingwandroid here https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/460 issuecomment-343320717 .
