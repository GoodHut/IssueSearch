 URL : "https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs/issues/604" TITLE : substitutions not working BODY : issue summary i can't seem to get substitutions to work correctly, using a transactional template. my template has the substitution tag {clienturl} in it. the email continues to only show {clienturl} rather than the actual url replacement. i've also tried various other formats for the substitution, including: clienturl clienturl %clienturl% <%clienturl%> steps to reproduce 1. create transactional template with {clienturl} anywhere in the content in addition to <%body%> . grab template id and sendgrid api key. 2. git clone https://github.com/holotrek/sendgrid-node-test.git 3. replace strings in <> with your particular keys/emails. note: i know not to put the api key right in the code, but for the purpose of this demo, i've attempted to make it as easy as possible to replicate. 4. node index.js 5. check for sent email 6. see that it still says {clienturl} 7. expected: {clienturl} to be replaced with http://localhost:4200 technical details: sendgrid-nodejs version: 6.1.4 node.js version: 6.9.1
