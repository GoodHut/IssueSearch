 URL : "https://github.com/baibaratsky/yii2-serialized-attributes-behavior/issues/5" TITLE : you could add a validator BODY : it would be nice if one could also specify a special rule four such fields. now i have to use _safe_ for such fields. e.g.: public function rules { return 'my_field' , 'serialized', 'max' => 10000 , ; } with _max_ it could be checked that the string won't get truncated.
