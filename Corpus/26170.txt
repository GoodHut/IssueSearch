 URL : "https://github.com/Neamar/KISS/issues/646" TITLE : add v prefix to tag BODY : as seen on https://github.com/neamar/kiss/tags your tagging scheme included a v prefix by now. 2.30.1 seems to change this or it was forgotton . f-droid checks for updates on this app via the ^v 0-9\. +$ regex. should i change that to match the new scheme or was this not intentionally? if the latter: mind add a second tag with v ? please do not remove the current tag, since i will add a manual interim build for now
