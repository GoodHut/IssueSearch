 URL : "https://github.com/BuildmLearn/Physics-Simulations/issues/4" TITLE : bug in atwood simulation BODY : in the atwood simulation, the bodies are connected to a pulley via a thread. however, when the position of any body moves above the position of pulley mid-point, a thread a shown going from within the body from the pulley mid-point to the top of the body. this should not happen as the bodies are opaque. i have corrected this and now the simulation looks more realistic. i would like to send a pr. @croozeus @costinpapuc
