 URL : "https://github.com/anshooarora/extentreports-java/issues/830" TITLE : tests status is debug BODY : hello, i am using extent reports with specflow and nunit. the problem that i'm facing is that, because i'm using extent for logging as well and for logs i use the info and the debug statuses, the status of the tests are always debug. now i don't know if this is the expected behavior and i should use only info for the logs. if i remove everything with debug the report is ok with pass and fail. the status of the tests is encapsulated and there's no public setter which makes sense so i don't see how i can do some custom status when i get debug. can you please give me some more insight about the debug usage in logs and if the behavior i am facing is the expected one? thank you, razvan
