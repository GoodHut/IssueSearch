 URL : "https://github.com/kmfarley11/8Bitify/issues/4" TITLE : reconstruct a wav file BODY : after 1 is completed, we will need to be able to reconstruct the wav file with our modifications. for this issue, execute 1 to deconstruct the wav file, then write new code to reconstruct the wav file, then validate the reconstruction worked. note: we may be able to use the standard file operations libraries to read / write, but if easier we could certainly use pysox to expedite the processing and development
