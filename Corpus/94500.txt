 URL : "https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/15413" TITLE : cannot set value correctly BODY : code sample, a copy-pastable example if possible python it's pretty simple but it doesn't work. here stocks is inside a class which type is pd.series. i tried to print money / price 1-r and found it was not zero. however, self.stocks name is never changed which confuses me self.stocks name += money / price 1 - r problem description see the comments above. it only happens when i tried to use a certain set of data but works for other situations. i've tried to change the value of self.stocks name and something more strange happened. python this works self.stocks name = 6 self.stocks name += money / price 1 - r i was able to see the different value printed after the line but if i change it to if self.stocks name == 0: self.stocks name = 0 self.stocks name += money / price 1 - r it repeated the unchanged result which drove me mad expected output output of pd.show_versions self.stocks name should be changed <details> paste the output here pd.show_versions here installed versions ------------------ commit: none python: 3.6.0.final.0 python-bits: 64 os: darwin os-release: 16.3.0 machine: x86_64 processor: i386 byteorder: little lc_all: none lang: zh_cn.utf-8 locale: zh_cn.utf-8 pandas: 0.19.2 nose: none pip: 9.0.1 setuptools: 32.2.0 cython: none numpy: 1.12.0 scipy: 0.18.1 statsmodels: none xarray: none ipython: 5.1.0 sphinx: none patsy: none dateutil: 2.6.0 pytz: 2016.10 blosc: none bottleneck: none tables: none numexpr: 2.6.2 matplotlib: 2.0.0 openpyxl: 2.4.2 xlrd: 1.0.0 xlwt: none xlsxwriter: none lxml: 3.7.2 bs4: none html5lib: none httplib2: none apiclient: none sqlalchemy: none pymysql: none psycopg2: none jinja2: 2.9.5 boto: none pandas_datareader: none </details>
