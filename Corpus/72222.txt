 URL : "https://github.com/johnmastro/trident-mode.el/issues/1" TITLE : better doc: add examples BODY : hi ! so this project looks awesome. i wanted to try it but i didn't know what to send to the browser. i started trident-mode, slime, skewer, the demo skewer page, iÂ see no error in the messages buffer and i sent trident-eval-sexp a parenscript snippet: ps-html :a :href foobar blorg ;; <a href=\ foobar\ >blorg</a> which i can not see in the browser. am i supposed to ? do i need to insert it in the dom ? that would make sense, but then parenscript doesn't seem to have built-ins for that. or i must read better its documentation which is a bit too low level imo, not very user-centric . do you have snippets we can evaluate to try trident-mode ? thanks ! ps: out of excitment, i referenced this project in a few places cliki, wikemacs http://wikemacs.org/wiki/common_lisp live_interaction_of_parenscript_with_the_browser , hopefully the awesome cl list and parenscript's readme . pps: did something change since you announced it on reddit 3 years ago ?
