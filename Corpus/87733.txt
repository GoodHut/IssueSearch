 URL : "https://github.com/filbs111/filbs111.github.io/issues/1" TITLE : make page more attractive BODY : used nicest github pages template could find, with near widest page, minimal cruft. would like different colours this may be possible by adding some css and retaining github's black box markdown->html. would prefer to use jekyll locally, so can see what's going on, and test page without commiting to github and waiting 5 minutes!
