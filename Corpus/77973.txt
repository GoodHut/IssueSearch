 URL : "https://github.com/algolia/yarnpkg-website/issues/16" TITLE : package detail additions BODY : - add devdependencies - add direct link to package.json github - change github api strategy to use etags when requesting activity, so we do not burn all rate limiting at once - add search and results by algolia, see how it works bottom of the page - ensure package detail pages are pre-rendered and available to google either via big sitemap or browse from 0 to z like page - hero title should most probably be the package name, we got the feedback from multiple sources instead of packages detail
