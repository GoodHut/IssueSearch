 URL : "https://github.com/Caiyeon/goldfish/issues/53" TITLE : database management page BODY : with the database plugin system, one backend can handle multiple connections, and the mapping of allowed roles to connections can get a little spaghetti. a dozen databases with a couple of dozen roles can seem very cryptic, even with vault's api. it would be nice to have a page that is able to fetch this information and display it in an intuitive fashion. a couple of problems that would have be considered are: how to handle multiple database backends how to fetch this data at scale. loading every connection config upon visiting the page would be overkill, if it can be avoided.
