 URL : "https://github.com/Playing-Indoors/KDM_WWW/issues/74" TITLE : user login api calls BODY : i wanted to outline the steps that we need to do for when the user logins. business requirements: 1. user logins 2. user gets taken to their current settlement. api steps update this as needed 1. user enters their information and hits login. start loading screen 2. post to /login 3. on success send a new get to /dashboard/ 4. on success pull their user.current_settlement.$oid and send a new get to settlement/get_sheet/ . while this is going on, async request /settlement/get_game_assets/<oid> . 5. on success stop loading screen and render /settlements/<oid> loading will take a bit of time since we're chaining 3 api calls together but since it's the first loading of the app we can probably get away with it. we can always optimize this later on. let me know if this logic looks correct.
