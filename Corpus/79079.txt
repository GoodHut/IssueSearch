 URL : "https://github.com/mollie/WooCommerce/issues/102" TITLE : review payment token api BODY : putting this here as a 'fyi' so mollie can review this api. woocommerce 2.6+ - payment token api https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/wiki/payment-token-api not required for woocommerce. but might be useful for mollie, could be used to store and show mandates https://www.mollie.com/nl/docs/reference/mandates/get to customers of a store. personally i wouldn't add support for this unless users of the plugin requested it.
