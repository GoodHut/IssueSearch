 URL : "https://github.com/docker/machine/issues/4022" TITLE : scp host not running BODY : trying to use docker-machine scp as detailed here https://docs.docker.com/engine/getstarted-voting-app/deploy-app/ copy-docker-stackyml-to-the-manager to transfer a file from the host to a machine. i have overcome all the 'host does not exist c ' stuff but i cannot get past host is not running . the exact command i am running is docker-machine scp /a/docker-stack.yml manager/home/docker/. , with the file located in the a: drive. i have tried this using multiple drives and both powershell and git bash. i will reinstall docker with the edge build instead of the stable build to see if it is fixed there, but without the ability to copy files to the machines i don't see a way to move forward.
