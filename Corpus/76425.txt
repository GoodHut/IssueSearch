 URL : "https://github.com/sergiodlopes/jquery-flexdatalist/issues/101" TITLE : json array inside object BODY : i've tried using dot notation and bracket notation but can't get either to work. lets say for example my json looks like this { name : jane doe , address : 1 main street }, { name : john doe , addresss : 2 main street } which is similar to your examples and it works fine. however my json looks likes this instead { selection1 : { name : jane doe , address : 1 main street }, { name : john doe , addresss : 2 main street } } which makes it not work. i need to have it work with the second way the json is formatted. any ideas?
