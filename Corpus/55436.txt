 URL : "https://github.com/javalnanda/Rollbar-iOSApp/issues/1" TITLE : ios push notifications BODY : it'd be great to be able to setup filters on new rollbar notifications and have certain ones result in an ios push notification happening. i know this is open source, so some ideas on how this could work: 1. rollbar webhook https://rollbar.com/docs/webhooks/ to aws lambda 2. aws lambda to third party push service: you give us a lamda string, we set it up 3. we put in api key of push service to app: onesignal.com there seems to be some option to send to a specific device using include_player_ids which does not require the rest api key, so perhaps the lambda could directly send a push with only thwt unique device id.
