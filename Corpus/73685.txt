 URL : "https://github.com/metadatacenter/cedar-project/issues/566" TITLE : date field unpredictable BODY : date field has poor handling of dates. text like nov 3 2010 in the data field is parsed, turned into a semi-random date 03/20/2010 for case above; if oct is entered, the current date is immediately entered ?! . hitting return multiple times after 3/7 does nothing at all, but hitting ok after that enters the date.
