 URL : "https://github.com/canton7/Simple.Migrations/issues/29" TITLE : support for filters BODY : thanks for this library! it would be nice if you could supply a filter func for filtering certain migrations. use case: in the migrations\update folder public class update_createstatetable : migration { ... // do updatey stuff create tables, rename columns, etc.. } in the migrations\seed folder public class seed_states : migration { ...// seed all states } in the migrations\testdata folder public class test_users : migration { ...// seed all test users } then i could provide the following filters to run different scenarios: this would run only my update scripts func<string, bool> filteroutseedandtestscripts = x => !x.contains seed && !x.contains test ; this would run only my seed scripts func<string, bool> filterouttestandupdatescripts = x => !x.contains update && !x.contains test this would run only my test scripts func<string, bool> filteroutseedandupdatescripts = x => !x.contains update && !x.contains seed
