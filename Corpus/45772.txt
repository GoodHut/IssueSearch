 URL : "https://github.com/hubisan/searx-userstyle-dark-theme/issues/2" TITLE : integration to server BODY : this dark theme is exactly what i am looking for. would it be possible to integrate it server side? i run my own searx-server and it would be much more convenient to have it as default theme on the server and not running a script on every machine/phone at home.
