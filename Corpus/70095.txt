 URL : "https://github.com/canonical-websites/vanillaframework.io/issues/32" TITLE : updates to current demo BODY : there are still some issues with the demo: http://vanillaframework.io-fix-design-review-points.demo.haus/ - the navigation is using a large font size than specified, it should be 14px https://github.com/ubuntudesign/vanilla-design/blob/master/navigation/navigation.md - the padding in the subscribe to newsletter input is still reversed - @pmahnke had changed this in vanilla - the link in the footer it should say vanilla framework - can we not have the navigation-closed words in the url after closing the nav? thanks.
