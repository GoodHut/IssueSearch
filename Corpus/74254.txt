 URL : "https://github.com/horosproject/horos/issues/208" TITLE : emailing multiple images BODY : at the moment you can only email one image at a time and we have multiple images per patient that requires us to be able to send all pictures in one email. i have been advised that this is currently a bug in your software that needs to be fixed and asked to add it as an issue so it can go into the development queue. kind regards, renae
