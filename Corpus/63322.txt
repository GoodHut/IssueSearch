 URL : "https://github.com/AlexKnauth/multi-file-lang/issues/3" TITLE : docs for file creation? BODY : i'm assuming from the docs that files are created and written to disk during macro expansion, and these files will exist at a path relative to the multi-file module's path. is that correct? if so, could the docs be expanded with those details about what bytes get written where and when?
