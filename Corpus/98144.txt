 URL : "https://github.com/zerodayz/citellus/issues/110" TITLE : improve network time check BODY : at the moment network time check consists of 3 tests: ./citellus/plugins/system/clock-0-ntp-services.sh ./citellus/plugins/system/clock-1-chrony.sh ./citellus/plugins/system/clock-1-ntpd.sh in a general system having whatever ntp configured is good, but: - if system is openstack node presence of openstack package , this means that: - chrony if enabled and/or started it's a failure - ntpd not enabled/nor started/synced it's a failure - if system is not openstack node, either ntpd or chronyd enabled and synced is ok logic could be to move the 'not chrony' logic to openstack subfolder of tests, so if chrony is enabled output error as 'chrony not supported on openstack node' and have ntpd fail if not enabled/started/synced for any other system chrony, or ntpd would be ok as long as they are synced
