 URL : "https://github.com/jfrabell/CASRS/issues/19" TITLE : risk color matrix BODY : i like how under analyze data, we can see how many reports are in each category for the last number of weeks. the x axis is meant to list the different colors, but i think it needs some coding for those headings. i'd also like to be able to click the numbers in the graph to populate a list of the actual reports that support that number, like the causal-factor historical matrix has.
