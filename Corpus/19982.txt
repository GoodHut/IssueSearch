 URL : "https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-dotnet/issues/31" TITLE : auto offset commit BODY : i am not sure if this is a bug; but figured that it was not expected behavior. i am running an advanced consumer with the configuration: new dictionary<string, object> { { group.id , _consumergroup}, { enable.auto.commit , true}, { auto.commit.interval.ms , 5000}, { statistics.interval.ms , 60000}, { bootstrap.servers , brokerlist}, { default.topic.config , new dictionary<string, object> { { auto.offset.reset , largest } } } }; --- scenario 1 - advanced producer writing to topic/advanced consumer consuming - offsets are committed every 5 seconds; as long as a new message comes in. - this is the expected behavior. scenario 2 - advanced producer is turned off/topic has unconsumed messages/then consumer is turned on - offsets are not committed until every message is received. - i do not believe this is the expected behavior. --- i believe that offsets should be auto committed with the interval; regardless of the state of the producer.
