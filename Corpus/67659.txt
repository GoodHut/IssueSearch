 URL : "https://github.com/seibaby/ff3us/issues/149" TITLE : protoarmor on the veldt BODY : this one is very widely known but the inclusion here is highly debatable, hence why i've listed it in this section. if you fight a group of one protoarmor and two pipsqueaks in the magitek factory, you'll be able to find the formation on the veldt despite the fact that protoarmor has no rage and pipsqueak is found in more than one formation not including this one. the reason this is debatable is because not only does this formation serve a purpose pipsqueak , but also because of how the veldt works in general. it is unknown if square simply forgot to exclude this formation or if they intended it to appear on the veldt, and can't be deduced at this time.
