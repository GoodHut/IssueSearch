 URL : "https://github.com/freedoom/freedoom/issues/501" TITLE : freedoom needs a story. BODY : so i wrote a short story for freedoom: > you were the founder of agm, the first and only interspecies corporation. the weapons that once made you billions are now the only things left to hide behind. the fortresses within which you payed people to develop unimaginable secrets are now teeming with the results of your failures. you can't tell if they're sick in the minds, or they're sanely seeking their revenge, but there's nothing you can do about it except to shoot first. i tried to put it on /r/writingprompts but it's too much text for a reddit title. feel free to write your own freedoom pre-stories here, or other ideas for how the freedoom story should go. and having a story will help us make the maps and graphics more consistent. and i'll take a look at the midgame texts, and see if i can change them to fit my story.
