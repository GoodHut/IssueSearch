 URL : "https://github.com/rstudio/tflearn/issues/2" TITLE : truncated stack traces BODY : i was working on this example https://github.com/rstudio/tflearn/blob/master/inst/examples/iris_custom_model.r : however i encountered the error with stack traces below which doesn't seem complete. i had this issue multiple times before but i was able to understand the error messages after reading the first few lines but this time it's a bit harder. @jjallaire could you see if you can reproduce it on your end? > classifier$fit input_fn = iris_input_fn, steps = 2 error in py_call_object attrib, args, keywords : keyerror: 0 detailed traceback: file /usr/local/opt/python/frameworks/python.framework/versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/util/deprecation.py , line 281, in new_func return func args, kwargs file /usr/local/opt/python/frameworks/python.framework/versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/contrib/learn/python/learn/estimators/estimator.py , line 424, in fit loss = self._train_model input_fn=input_fn, hooks=hooks file /usr/local/opt/python/frameworks/python.framework/versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/contrib/learn/python/learn/estimators/estimator.py , line 933, in _train_model model_fn_ops = self._call_legacy_get_train_ops features, labels file /usr/local/opt/python/frameworks/python.framework/versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/contrib/learn/python/learn/estimators/estimator.py , line 1002, in _call_legacy_get_train_ops train_ops = self._get_train_ops features, labels fil
