 URL : "https://github.com/fslaborg/FSharp.Charting/issues/125" TITLE : incomplete api on linux BODY : the gtk version has only a small subset of the charting functions working due to an incomplete_api flag set removing most of them. it would be very kind if this was documented somewhere, perhaps on the main readme that the gtk version is incomplete. perhaps simply list which functions are available for gtk or list which ones are not.
