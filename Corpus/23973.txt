 URL : "https://github.com/udacity/sdc-issue-reports/issues/1228" TITLE : ros vm: roscore ip BODY : if network interface has multiple addresses ex: ipv6 enabled was default for me roscore will fail as hostname -i returns multiple ip, resulting into a invalid url.
into .bashrc, replacing it with:
export ros_ip=$ hostname -i | awk '{print $1}' solves the problem in case of multiple ip addresses
