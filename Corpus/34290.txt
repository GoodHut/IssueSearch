 URL : "https://github.com/mirasvit/module-profiler/issues/17" TITLE : can't see ajax calls BODY : hi, is there a way to also catch the ajax requests? they are handled on a different page and i think they're not shown. in the past we used aoeprofiler, there you could easily see what happened since all was nicely stored in database and you could look into each request afterwards. might be a good idea to do something similar unless i'm missing something? :
