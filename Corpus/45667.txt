 URL : "https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/4612" TITLE : improved auto skipper BODY : there's an ticks.autoskip feature docs http://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/axes/cartesian/ , which plots only a subset of ticks and labels to avoid overlapping labels. we should make the following improvements to the auto skipper: move it to run at the end of the update process rather than during draw, make it aware of major ticks. it should first attempt to include all major ticks. it should then attempt to include minor ticks in between. this should fix https://github.com/chartjs/chart.js/issues/4600 use the auto skipper in the time scale remove autoskip: false from the time scale source https://github.com/chartjs/chart.js/blob/master/src/scales/scale.time.js l396 source: 'auto' should generate a tick at every minor unit. generate should not attempt to do anything smart
