 URL : "https://github.com/stealjs/vuejs-example/issues/2" TITLE : single file components BODY : something that would make me use stealjs over webpack would be out-of-the-box full support for vue's single file .vue components. documentation: https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/single-file-components.html example: entername.vue html <template> <label class= name-entry > enter your name: <input type= text v-model= name > </label> <div class= name v-if= name >your name is {{ name }}.</div> </template> <script> module.exports = { data: function { return { name: '' }; } }; </script> <style scoped lang= sass > .name-entry border: 1px solid ccc border-radius: 4px .name font-size: 18px </style> the <template> , <script> , and <style> blocks can all accept a lang attribute, like so: html <template lang= markdown > an h1 with my {{ name }} </template> this allows you to write your: markup in haml, pug/jade, markdown, etc. scripts in jsx, typescript, coffeescript, es2050 or whatever styles in sass, scss, less, stylus vue is designed to be incredibly easy, then you get to this level and you're kinda screwed because it takes you a decade to setup webpack to be able to do this. it's a great idea, but it's a pain to set up.
