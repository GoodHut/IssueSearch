 URL : "https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/2612" TITLE : use sudo in $path BODY : i am using https://github.com/mattrajca/sudo-touchid to replace the builtin sudo. i have installed the new sudo command into /usr/local/bin/sudo and modified my $path appropriately but home-brew seems to have /usr/bin/sudo hardcoded so it is not using my replaced sudo. could the path be changed to use whatever command is found in $path instead of hardcoding it to /usr/bin/sudo ?
