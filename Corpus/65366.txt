 URL : "https://github.com/viewflow/django-material/issues/306" TITLE : inline formsets missing BODY : the documentation shows here http://docs.viewflow.io/forms_formsets.html how the user can use fields like modelformfield to nest forms. unfortunately, i can't find this feature in the current version. was this feature removed for some reason, or moved so i can't find it or is the documentation wrong?
