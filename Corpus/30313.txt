 URL : "https://github.com/ArduCAM/Arduino/issues/227" TITLE : ov7670 w/ v2 shield BODY : hello, i have an ov7670 camera that i would like to connect to a v2 shield and arduino uno. however, the camera has 8 sets of pin pairs, while the shield has 10 sets of pin pairs where the camera is supposed to be connected. i have tried to connect the pins on the camera in the middle, to the left and to the right on the shield but i can't get the program posted here to work it works on ov7670, btw . is there another way i should connect the camera e.g. with wires ? i have the same problem with ov9655, which has 9 pairs of pins. do you know how to solve this as well?
