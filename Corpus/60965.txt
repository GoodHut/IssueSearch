 URL : "https://github.com/blakek/simon-server/issues/7" TITLE : add simple landing page BODY : right now, nothing is shown if you navigate to the server's address using a web browser. we should, at minimum, show an information page to lead to the github account, and a stats page would be even better. some ideas of what the page could display: - links to the github repos - downloads for each system electron app for each system and others in the future - total number of connections - the number of open connections by room - perhaps rooms could show usernames of open connections within the room - maybe a way to search for a username or more e.g. if we used oauth logins, we could allow searching by name
