 URL : "https://github.com/lexruee/pi-switch-python/issues/18" TITLE : pi_switch install issue BODY : sudo pip install pi_switch within the /home/pi/wiringpi directory is taking hours freezing my pi 3 i've tried 3 times it cleared back to command prompt only once and showed an error that there is an encoding issue. i would provide the exact error but i'm an hour into attempting this install again. i did look into using the method you recommended with the pure python but as i'm attempting to replicate your awshome project i need the script for acquiring the codes sent by the remote control on the etekcity device. any help you can provide is appreciated. i already have amazon svcs with alexa and voice running on my pi. i thought your project would be easy to follow and get going, but i'm hung up. thanks in advance
