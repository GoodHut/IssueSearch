 URL : "https://github.com/cale312/IBC_API/issues/1" TITLE : relational database model BODY : @ruanengelbrecht this is the repo. but this one doesn't have the old non-related database code, it only has the latest code which is what i am currently working on. for some reason because you are not in the projectcodex gitlab domain i cant add you as a member so that you can see my code. guess we will stick to the guthub one instead.
