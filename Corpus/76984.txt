 URL : "https://github.com/scalyr/scalyr-agent-2/issues/67" TITLE : metrics are logged twice BODY : the scalyr agent on linux sends process and system metrics directly to scalyr using a source of tsdb . but it also writes the metrics to /var/log/scalyr-agent-2/linux_system_metrics.log and /var/log/scalyr-agent-2/linux_process_metrics.log and uploads those logfiles to scalyr. this means the log volume from those metrics is effectively doubled, which can add up as the number of servers grows. unfortunately it seems to be impossible to exclude those logfiles using an exclude value in the config file's log section.
