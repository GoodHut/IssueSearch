 URL : "https://github.com/5thColumn/kibana5-vectormap/issues/6" TITLE : tooltips are not visible BODY : after a brief inspection, i've discovered: - tooltips have position - tooltips have style - tooltips have size - tooltips have content - tooltips are still not visible and i don't know why something is preventing them from showing up to the user - this needs to be investigated and fixed. <img width= 1178 alt= screen shot 2017-02-17 at 11 10 02 am src= https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1046742/23075551/8fb54c16-f502-11e6-848f-3f358a147f92.png >
