 URL : "https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-php/issues/30" TITLE : flush in tracer BODY : due to php language model, we need to flush to either the backend or somewhere else on every request for example with register_shutdown_function so, since this model is part of the interface, should we encourage implementors to register the flush on construct ? php class tracer extends ottracer { public function __construct { ... register_shutdown_function $this, 'flush' ; } ... } that would be convenient as the tracer will flush by default when the request is gone. ping @jonahgeorge @felixfbecker @beberlei @tedsuo @yurishkuro
