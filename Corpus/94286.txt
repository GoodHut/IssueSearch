 URL : "https://github.com/daveaglick/Scripty/issues/107" TITLE : bump .netframework version BODY : i was wondering if bumping the .net framework version i believe the .exe that's downloaded when you install scripty via nuget is v4.0 would bumping this to v4.5 allow us to start referencing .netcore .dlls? looking at the following grid: https://github.com/dotnet/standard/blob/master/docs/versions.md we might be able to start referencing .net standard 1.0 this looks like it might partially solve issue 50 for some users too?
