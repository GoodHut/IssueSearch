 URL : "https://github.com/jwyang/lr-gan.pytorch/issues/5" TITLE : about affine function BODY : thank you for your great work. i am studying your code recently. however, i do not touch any pytorch before so that cannot figure out how the affine function in modules/gridgen.py & functions/gridgen.py works. could you explain the meaning of variable 'grid', 'grad_output', 'grad_input' respectly? or show the workflow of affinegridgen how to do. it will be very helpful for me to understand the full operating workflow in lr-gan. thank you so much.
