 URL : "https://github.com/dalaranwow/dalaran-wow/issues/5173" TITLE : fear/death coil path BODY : hello, ive just noticed you deployed another patch of 'hot fixes' none of which happens to be the death coil/fear path that makes every warlock's life miserable, so i've decided to raise awareness by reminding you about this bug that ,for the record, ive reported since 2014 and which no one seems to be giving a crap about. so the bug is that feared/death coiled targets teleport around the caster, making it impossible to cast anything on them.
