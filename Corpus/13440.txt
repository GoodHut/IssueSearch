 URL : "https://github.com/BattlePro/battlepro-issues/issues/51" TITLE : update news page BODY : interactive mouse over animation on news articles creates a drastic visual change when navigating. i prefer the original site's minimalist and clean approach. the additional colors don't seem necessary. i think the contrast of the border is more extreme with the new version too. think its best to discard this visual treatment and explore a different kind of mouse over action. perhaps the image can expand inside while not changing the dimensions of the frame. would be more subtle. ! capture https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6005869/29297449-18a091bc-812f-11e7-8c9a-d67ec5b8482e.jpg ! news https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6005869/29297451-1bf60284-812f-11e7-979b-8aa55b371223.jpg
