 URL : "https://github.com/johncarl81/parceler/issues/311" TITLE : unwrap is very slow BODY : when i use parceler, my app becomes very slow compared to native implementation of parcels in my class. it can take 3-5 seconds for a class to unwrap. wrap function is fast though. there is a list of objects, like 50 items long, 5 strings, 1 integer and 1 date object per item, 20 characters per string, that takes most of the time when unwrapping. the class also contains some private static final default values, without and getters, but they should not matter, right? the reason that i use parceler is due to that i use realm database, so i've got converters for the realmlist of the items. what can cause the slowness and what can be done about it? what should i look for? there are public getters and setters for all member variables and the member variables are not private.
