 URL : "https://github.com/ocaml/tuareg/issues/141" TITLE : improving jbuilder support BODY : i see that tuareg now has some elementary support for jbuilder - sweet! i'm very pleased to see that there's interest in jbuilder and i'd like to expand on this initial support. some ideas/notes/questions i have in mind: jbuild files should have their own major mode derived off lisp or scheme why did you choose lisp over scheme mode for jbuilder? some janestreet users said that they used scheme mode, but i'm not sure what's the difference here anyway. change the default indentation to 1 space. that seems to be the standard for all jbuild files out there. support jbuild stanza keywords support the special multiline comment syntax add some sort of linting support with flycheck/flymake. this might require a little support from jbuilder itself but it should be a fairly rudimentary change. what do you think?
