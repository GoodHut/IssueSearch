 URL : "https://github.com/dthain/basekernel/issues/85" TITLE : mount doesn't always work BODY : if the first command i enter is mount 2 cdrom , the mount succeeds. strangely, if i do anything before running that command, it hangs when i do. i was traced the problem to this https://github.com/dthain/basekernel/blob/201c59e19220cad3e39b428c5842bc690d5854a6/src/fs.c l67 statement: c return f->mount device_no ; i think it's supposed to call this https://github.com/dthain/basekernel/blob/c17f500ca882f775c5ab5bfa8b566f1194def87c/src/cdromfs.c l221 function, cdrom_volume_open , but a debug print statement at the beginning of it is never reached.
