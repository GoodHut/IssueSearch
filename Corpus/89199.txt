 URL : "https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/issues/1828" TITLE : pre-fill issues in github BODY : github offers a way to pre-fill issues https://github.com/blog/2111-issue-and-pull-request-templates as you can see for example here https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/issues/new . i think we should do this for the cgal repository to help the users fill a comprehensive issue there are lots of issues where we need to ask questions about the configuration or even for a code sample . this could also be a way to give pointers to the most frequent problems for example, users who have a weird output just because they did not use the right kernel, etc. . i suggest we discuss what to put in the message here. here's a first draft: > issue details > > _describe your issue. please be specific compilation error, runtime error, unexpected behavior, wrong results, etc. ._ > > source code > > _if your issue arises by using cgal in your own source code, please provide a minimalist example that we can compile easily to reproduce the bug. if your issue arises from using a cgal program demo, example, etc. , please let us know which one. helping you solving an issue is much easier and efficient if we can reproduce it._ > > environment > > operating system windows/mac/linux, 32/64 bits : > compiler: > release or debug mode > specific flags used if any : > cgal version: > boost version: > other libraries versions if used eigen, tbb, etc. : > > frequently encountered issues > > kernel: are you using an exact or inexact kernel? > ... for this last section, we should maybe discuss what to put and where to redirect the user documentation, wiki, etc. .
