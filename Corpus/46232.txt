 URL : "https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-dotnet/issues/91" TITLE : locked dll on windows BODY : when using the library, the dlls librdkafka and zlib are locked by the w3p process and can't be deleted/updated until the webservice is stopped. in a webapi hosted in iis on windows server 2008 r2/ windows 10, this prevent the option to replace bin folder to update the service on the fly i wonder if it's possible to avoid this lock?
