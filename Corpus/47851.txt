 URL : "https://github.com/cryogen/throneteki/issues/403" TITLE : queen cersei lanister BODY : queen cersei http://thronesdb.com/card/05001 is currently implemented incorrect. she reacts to each card being discarded and not as a whole. if opponent discards 2 cards at once wardens or 2 claim she will get only 1 power. the example is with manually resolving wardens of the west http://thronesdb.com/card/02030 , and that may be the issue here. ! untitled https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19303834/23064502/15a85b40-f519-11e6-826c-492fa991a864.png you can clearly see that she got power for each card discarded and not the discard as a whole. cheers,
