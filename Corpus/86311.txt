BODY : dear experts, i can't seem to get the homing cycle to run on the gcode sender. i have no issue at all jogging the motors through the controller but when i try to run the homing cycle, nothing happens. i'm currently using makerbot limit switches with 3 wires red, black, and green and i've tried all wiring configurations. i am using protoneer's cnc shield v3 which has dedicated end stop pins. what gets me is that i hooked up a limit switch to the e-stop pins and it worked exactly as it should. when i use the same wire configurations on the end stop pins, absolutely nothing happens. if any of you have any insight to what's going on, please let me know! thanks! ! image https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/27812888/25230113/d2ed9596-25a0-11e7-85c7-08890673b61c.png
