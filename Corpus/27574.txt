 URL : "https://github.com/CardBook/CardBook/issues/27" TITLE : display sync status BODY : how can i check from cardbook when my contact s have been synchronized? i created the first contact in a new address book from cardbook, and it doesn't turn up in tbs legacy address book, and not on the server either. restarting thunderbird does not change this. i'd like to manually toggle sync, but the synchronize button in the cardbook toolbar is greyed out. question migrated from 26 -- sorry, it was misplaced there in the first place
