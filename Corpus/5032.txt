 URL : "https://github.com/web3j/web3j/issues/48" TITLE : java 7 support BODY : hi, i'd like to use web3j in a java 7 project. any chance you have a version without futures and observables etc.? or maybe could point me to an old commit that had a working rpc client but none of that java 8 goodness? otherwise i'll probably have to manually cull the async stuff...
