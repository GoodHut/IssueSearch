submission from: nc88.tf.phil.uu.nl 131.211.143.88 dear all, i get the following error message: error: tactic generated a subgoal identical to the original goal. for some line rewrite t. , where t inhabits an equality t1=t2 and where t1 occurs in the goal statement.
it works if i do replace t1 with t2; 2: exact t. . this error can be reproduced by downloading <http://www.phil.uu.nl/~hendriks/coq/misc/test.tar.gz> and compiling make opt . the weird thing is that with file name.v.old for name.v , compilation raises no errrors,
but with name.v.new for name.v it does.
the difference between the files name.v.old and name.v.new is that where the former uses parameter and axiom , the latter uses definition s. best regards,
