 URL : "https://github.com/JohnEarnest/Octo/issues/63" TITLE : add .8o file load feature BODY : as an octo user, i would like to be able to load a .8o from my file system, so that i can continue working on previously saved octo programs. 62 added the ability to download octo source code as a .8o file. subsequently, the ability to load a .8o from the user's file system was requested in the comments of 58. this is purely a convenience feature; currently, the user can easily copy and paste into octo. this might be implemented using the filereader api https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/api/filereader .
