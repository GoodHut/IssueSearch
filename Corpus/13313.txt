 URL : "https://github.com/snowleopard/hadrian/issues/306" TITLE : track ghc commit BODY : it looks like there is no way to associate a particular hadrian commit to a ghc commit, so the build failure caused by potential unexpected ghc update like in 305 can be very hard to detect. i suggest tagging the git hash of the most recent successfully built ghc somewhere, and instruct user/ci to check out corresponding version automatically.
