 URL : "https://github.com/santosjorge/cufflinks/issues/62" TITLE : trouble with ta lib BODY : i just installed this for the first time, and having trouble using it. the error i'm getting is no module named talib when i import cufflinks. i ran brew install talib . are there other steps involved? running pip install ta-lib also fails on the gcc command fatal error: 'ta-lib/ta_defs.h' file not found . how can i get a hold of v0.10 in the meantime? i'd love to take this for a spin.
