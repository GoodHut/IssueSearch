 URL : "https://github.com/jettro/c3-angular-directive/issues/162" TITLE : numerous donuts on page BODY : i've got a problem with a very long time of charts initialisation. it's quite specific case because there is about 30 blocks with charts rendered using ng-repeat other hand the data is ultra-simle to show . all blocks are rendered, than app freezes for like 7 sec. is there any way to enforce asynchronous rendering of the charts or while ng-repeat is working?
