 URL : "https://github.com/thetarkus/django-semanticui-forms/issues/17" TITLE : data-value in dropdown BODY : for dropdown menu items, semantic ui allows a value other than the primary key to be used as the value submitted in the request via the data-value attribute on the menu item. i can't think of a way to do this in the current implementation of django-semanticui-forms. if there is not, i would like to request this feature. an example is that i am currently building a dropdown choice field for recipient email address. for users in the database, i need to have the dropdown render their email addresses in the data-value field, not the id of the user record. i am doing it this way because i also want to initialize the dropdown as {allowadditions: true} so that additional free-form email addresses can be entered. the recipient field is defined as charfield that stores email addresses as comma-separated values. thank you.
