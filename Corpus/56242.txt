 URL : "https://github.com/wbinnssmith/redux-normalizr-middleware/issues/9" TITLE : mistake in the readme? BODY : hi, first of all, thanks for creating this. i like the approach. i've just been setting it up in my project, and was a little confused by something in the readme, and figured it could be a small mistake? place this middleware before anything that expects flattened data, and after anything that makes the nested data available so before something like redux-thunk or redux-promise-middleware . should the before above not be after instead? or am i misunderstanding the sentence before? thanks!
