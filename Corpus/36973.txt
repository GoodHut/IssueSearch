 URL : "https://github.com/andy-portmen/country-flags/issues/1" TITLE : ip whois improvement BODY : hi, _country flags & ip whois 0.1.2_ on firefox 51.0.1 x64 there are many whois sites on the market. the one chosen for _country flags & ip whois 0.1.2_ is isc.sans.edu i propose to change it as i to tcpiputils.com for two reasons, 1- if _isc.sans.edu_ is accessed with a reasonable delay, on another hand it's quest of ip whois resolution is excessively slow; 2- imo _tcpiputils.com_ is far more complete than _isc.sans.edu_ to achieve this here i took the liberty for modifying for myself only of course: user profile \ \extensions\{802a552e-13d1-4683-a40a-1e5325fba4bb}\common.js line 140 : replace https://isc.sans.edu/ipinfo.html?ip= with http://www.tcpiputils.com/browse/ip-address/
