 URL : "https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-budget/issues/16" TITLE : add material costs BODY : dear, i just installed kanboard and find it quite impressive - with the budget addon. it would suit me even more if i was able to add something like material costs to a task or a subtask one time costs, possible multiple times per task and to calculate them on a task/ project level. could this be implemented? thank you for your feedback, best regards, philip
