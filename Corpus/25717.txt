 URL : "https://github.com/monicanagent/cypherpoker/issues/36" TITLE : actionscript only ? BODY : sorry i had no idea how to contact you. i think this p2p poker is genius, i'm far less enthusiastic with the actionscript client & i'd like to see if you'd agree to develop with me or by guiding me so i can work fast an html5/js client for desktop browsers. maybe also unity later on. let me know, i'm looking for a poker engine to launch a new room & this p2p architecture could fit so well with my concept but not the actionscript in browser ! . thehairinthesoup@protonmail.com
