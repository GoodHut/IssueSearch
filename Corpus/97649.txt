BODY : hello! i'd like to know how are userids are generated. i ask this because i have 2 bots connected to facebook messenger. i have them say the userid of the person that is talking to them. and with the same facebook account, the bot is giving me a userid on one bot, and on the other one it is giving me another userid. i believe this happens as well on skype and some other channels. thanks!
