 URL : "https://github.com/inukshuk/anystyle-parser/issues/77" TITLE : running rake on windows BODY : i am trying to build from source on windows but i am getting the following error when running rake ........ cd tmp/x64-mingw32/native/2.4.2 c:/ruby24-x64/bin/ruby.exe -i. ../../../../ext/wapiti/extconf.rb --trace checking for -lpthread... ../../../../ext/wapiti/extconf.rb failed could not create makefile due to some reason, probably lack of necessary libraries and/or headers. check the mkmf.log file for more details. you may need configuration options. ....... i've found this similar thread https://github.com/inukshuk/anystyle-parser/issues/75 , and this one https://github.com/inukshuk/anystyle-parser/issues/27 , but i'm not sure what to make of it. i have done: gem install pthread not sure if that's relevant also i can find pthread.h on my system, in the installation directory of i686-7.2.0-posix-dwarf-rt_v5-rev0 installed by the mingw-w64 installer . since i have 0 experience with ruby, i'm clueless on what to do next... my best guess is that rake is failing to find the pthread.h file? any help would be appreciated.
