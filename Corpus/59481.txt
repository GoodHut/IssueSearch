' my_serial.setport port ; my_serial.setbaudrate 500000 ; my_serial.settimeout 2000,2000,2000,2000,2000 ; my_serial.open ; ' is not working the output from stty is 'stty -f /dev/ttyusb0 speed 9600 baud; line = 0; min = 0; time = 0; -brkint -icrnl -imaxbel -opost ' but after setting the port up with putty 'stty -f /dev/ttyusb0 speed 500000 baud; line = 0; min = 1; time = 0; -brkint -icrnl ixoff -imaxbel -opost -onlcr -isig -icanon -iexten -echo -echoe -echok ' and if i try to start my driver he is working perfectly so it stems that setbaud is not able to set this rate but why? putty is giving me the debug output from the module and the driver i have written also, after setting the port up with putty, so why is setbaudrate not able to set my wish baud rate ? serial lib is from ros-jade i am using linux ubuntu 14.04 mfg matthias
