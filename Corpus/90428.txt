 URL : "https://github.com/T-Rex96/Easy_xkcd/issues/111" TITLE : share the image and title BODY : when sharing an xkcd comic the person i send it too should be able to have the full experience so a share function like twidere does would be perfect: - image - title comment of the author - link to use his own app on it maybe we would also include the comic title.
