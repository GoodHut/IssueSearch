 URL : "https://github.com/GM-Alex/user-access-manager/issues/91" TITLE : file block and images BODY : once i activate the file block all my images are not available anymore. if i try to reach them with direct link i get a 404. pdf files have no problem. i tried also to choose the types which will not be locked but it doesn't seems to work. if i disable the file block everything works fine. i'm pretty sure that i'm doing something wrong. thanks in advance.
