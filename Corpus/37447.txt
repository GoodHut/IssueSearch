 URL : "https://github.com/PanJiaChen/vue-countTo/issues/5" TITLE : make update possible BODY : it would be very nice to be able to update the values without the need to manually change both the start end endval. in my setup i have a vote mechanism where i display several options with percentage values. anytime a user votes, the values update automatically. the issue with this component is that i can't update the values from its current values like from 50 to 80 percent without braking it. any idea how to manage that usecase? by the way, thanks for that cool component. keep up the good workd ;
