 URL : "https://github.com/kartik-v/dependent-dropdown/issues/58" TITLE : initialize = true problem BODY : to start with, i have already updated all of my plugins to the latest available dev-master versions. i have a scenario where i have 4 dropdowns. however they are not all dependent upon each other as in the advanced usage scenario 3. my scenario is: drop-0 direct loaded from db drop-1 direct loaded from db drop-2 direct loaded from db drop-3 dependent on drop-0, drop-1, drop-2 so drop-3 is dependent on the values chosen in the first three but they aren't dependent on each other. all of that works as desired. the only thing that i am having issues with is that on load of an existing record, drop-3 only shows the selected value and not all possible ones. this is with initialize = false by default and initdepends not being set either. however, if i set initialize = true in the plugin options then it will show all possible values but then the value from the db is never actually selected . if i examine the output being sent back, it shows: { output : { id :1, name :1},{ id :2, name :2},{ id :3, name :3} , selected :2} and 2 is the correct value from the db.
