 URL : "https://github.com/groeck/it87/issues/9" TITLE : it8620 pwm4 issue BODY : i just got a gigabyte ga-z97m-d3h that uses the it8620e. it has 1x cpu_fan and 3x sys_fan on board. with the default kernel - without adding this driver - pwmconfig could only detect pwm1 cpu / fan1 , pwm2 fan2 and pwm3 fan3 . fan4 was properly detected too, but not pwm4. so i downloaded the driver, compiled and installed it, after which pwm5 appeared. it was not controlling fan4 however. i then manually commented out line 2648 @ it87.c so pwm4 does not get skipped, and re-installed the driver. that made pwm4 appear as well. pwmconfig still cannot bind it to fan4 properly, but i found out why after tinkering a bit with /etc/fancontrol directly. the pwm4 values for fan4 are inverted you probably already know this so when pwmconfig has all the pwm values set to 255 to check for installed fans, fan4 is not spinning and is therefore omitted it spins full speed with pwm4 set to 0 . this fixed the issue for me, but i suspect i will have to redo the fix with every kernel update. thanks for looking into it, ping me if you need more info.
