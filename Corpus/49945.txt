 URL : "https://github.com/hadley/devtools/issues/1444" TITLE : use of install.libs.r BODY : i am working on a package which builds a command line executable in src/ and then copies it to bin/ in the package directory using install.libs.r as suggested by the writing r extensions manual https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/r-exts.html package-subdirectories . however, it appears that devtools::load_all does not support install.libs.r . for this reason i've had to turn off the option 'use devtools package functions if available' in rstudio while developing the package. is the lack of support for install.libs.r considered a bug? if not, is there a recommended way to install binaries that is compatible with devtools?
