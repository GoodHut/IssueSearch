 URL : "https://github.com/gmostert/ng2-breadcrumb/issues/89" TITLE : fix npm warnings BODY : it looks like the package.json file has gotten out of date. everything seems to be working anyways, but a couple of warnings are raised by npm when doing a npm install after a fresh clone. npm warn deprecated @types/moment@2.13.0: this is a stub types definition for moment https://github.com/moment/moment . moment provides its own type definitions, so you don't need @types/moment installed! npm warn deprecated express@2.5.11: express 2.x series is deprecated npm warn deprecated connect@1.9.2: connect 1.x series is deprecated ... skipping ... npm warn @angular/platform-server@4.4.6 requires a peer of @angular/animations@4.4.6 but none is installed. you must install peer dependencies yourself. added 469 packages in 29.629s especially, the deprecated packages can be more problematic if they are so because of some vulnerabilities they might have.
