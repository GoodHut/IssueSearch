 URL : "https://github.com/phpseclib/phpseclib/issues/1218" TITLE : api changes in 2.0.8 BODY : our tests have just upgraded to phpseclib 2.0.8 and this lead to several breakages as this changes api in quite severe way. can you please consider increasing major version when doing such changes? honestly i think this should have been called 3.0.0... commits leading to problems in phpmyadmin, but there are probably more api breakages in 2.0.8: c509909004345d8434a2c21983aa5c61f825fa4a - crypt\base is gone 4171262b9ee6f905eb2bfc4a942c5f44483efdf8 - using strings instead of constants 2a1177b256361220c5666faa17d7afef34f39998 - making private previously public attribute which didn't have accessor before adjusting to these changes is not a complex task, but this is certainly not expected from patchlevel version change, see https://semver.org/
