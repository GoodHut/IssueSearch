 URL : "https://github.com/simon-brooke/swinging-needle-meter/issues/1" TITLE : internet exploder :- BODY : renders perfectly in internet exploder 11.0.9600.18697, but doesn't work. you can move the sliders, but the needles don't move. no errors are reported on the console. this is perhaps not surprising - the re-com https://github.com/day8/re-com documentation says that it's built for chrome and not heavily tested on internet explorer; and this depends heavily on re-com.
