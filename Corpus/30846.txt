 URL : "https://github.com/metacurrency/holochain/issues/141" TITLE : refactor -- actions BODY : abstract the aspects associated with a function available to all nuclei into an action, i.e. validation, additions to chain/dht. currently these are spread across a bunch of files and adding a new action as i'm doing in 55 requires touching all of them. this refactor should allow adding functional and data definitions for the different aspects to be defined in one place.
