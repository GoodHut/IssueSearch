 URL : "https://github.com/mkdo/cpd/issues/44" TITLE : templates not working BODY : hi guys, i followed the instructions on the youtube tutorial but when i reached the template phase where i should edit the default template and then be able to set each new user with it, i can't see it under the templates section, nor can i create a new one. i am running _multisite_ and all the other requirements are met. i have never come across this which makes me think the plugin is blocking the templates for some reason. do you have any idea why would this happen?
