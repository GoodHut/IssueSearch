 URL : "https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/CRUD/issues/663" TITLE : search button option BODY : i like the filter solution implemented in the backpack, but some users tell me that when multiple filters are applied the page is frozen with each selected filter or when it is typing a search. are there any way to fire search action by a search button for example? that is: clicking all the requested filters and/or search term and fire the search after that. best regards.
