 URL : "https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts/issues/71" TITLE : runtime type parameters? BODY : as i'm currently testing to use io-ts with ts-runtime https://github.com/fabiandev/ts-runtime instead of flow-runtime https://github.com/codemix/flow-runtime/tree/master/packages/flow-runtime , i was wondering if generics are on the roadmap? ts type foo<t extends any = null> = { prop: t; }; let foo: foo<number> = { prop: 1 }; to validate the typescript code from above with, e.g., something like this in javascript: js // const foo = ... let foo = t.validate { prop: 1 }, t.get foo, t.number ; i'm trying to get as close as possible to typescript's static type check behavior at runtime with ts-runtime which i still consider experimental, but i want to move it forward , and i think this library offers more flexibility to introduce custom types/features at a smaller footprint.
