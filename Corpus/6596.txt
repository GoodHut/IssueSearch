 URL : "https://github.com/roecrew/zam/issues/3" TITLE : ajax needs work BODY : as stated by ugwe43to874nf4 on reddit https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/7n2ng8/zam_10_is_out_you_can_now_declaratively_render/ i meant it in a related way to the previous paragraphs. that is, you get the options.data and depending on the content type specified, apply some transformations. that is, if the content is application/x-www-form-urlencoded, then you could e.g. check if options.data is a string, and if it's not, if it's an object {a:1, b:2,c:3}, you could properly encode it to a=1&b=2&c=3. as it is now, all the responsibility falls onto the calling code, while most people would probably expect this should be something the function does.
