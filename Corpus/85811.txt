 URL : "https://github.com/mjdenham/and-bible/issues/92" TITLE : font issue with greek nts BODY : hi i have made a sword module from the greek nt of the church of greece, which is similar to the antoniades, but has accents: www.myriobiblos.gr/bible/nt2/ my module and the code is here: https://github.com/gottesfurcht/myrio the module has a font issue in and-bible. i doesn't switch to the greek font which is necessary to render the accents. i have tried various things, like specifying the font etc. but to no avail. i found that other modules have the same issue, for example the two greek modules from ebible.org: grcsbl2010eb and grctischeb even though both have the same configuration font etc. sblgnt switches to the right font and tischendorf does not. morphgnt is also not switching to the greek font and the letters with accents are missing. any idea what is causing this and how to fix it? thanks, ruben
