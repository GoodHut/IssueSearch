 URL : "https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/pbdmms/issues/226" TITLE : back breaking work BODY : i got a new bed but set it up wrong so i can barely sit up let alone walk about right now so i'm working from home. i was trying to get the model to run at home and richel, you had suggested if g++-5 doesn't work, replace it with g++. i did that and now i'm getting: boost/test/unit_test.hpp: no such file or directory as the issue. i tried googling and it seems to be suggesting i don't have the boost libraries but i thought the g++ issue was that i needed mingw which wasn't true. thanks for your help!
