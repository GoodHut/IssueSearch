 URL : "https://github.com/wwilsman/monopoly-wallet/issues/25" TITLE : improve loading state BODY : the current loading reducer doesn't feel very complete. it was made to provide info about which action from the server the app is currently waiting for. if a second action triggers a loading state the old loading state is lost. there are also places where some loading-based code will be duplicated. such as currently in the welcome and joingame components a small timeout is set so not to flash the loading status when the action happens quickly. this will probably be needed elsewhere loading states are set to avoid flashing the status too quickly. at the same time it shouldn't be baked into the loading state to wait a short amount of time. one of the goals of setting the loading state was to enable other actions to be performed after the player is waiting. such as when auctioning a property, if we're waiting for the property to be auction we should be directed to the auction when it happens; if we aren't waiting for the auction we should be shown a toast instead. not sure of the best course of action involving loading states. also not sure if the timeout is necessary, or if we should just flash the loading state regardless.
