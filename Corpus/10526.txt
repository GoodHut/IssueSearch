 URL : "https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5/issues/274" TITLE : cmsis spi driver BODY : hello, i am trying to implement the cmsis spi driver for a new processor platform. according to the spi driver description picture under reference/spidriver showing a master with 3 slaves , it should be possible to use the driver with different select signals ss . here i miss a function in the driver which selects the ss signal for the next transfer call. does this mean, i have to implement a function which goes around the cmsis spi driver which selects the ss signal in the hardware driver? if this is right, i thing there is something missing in the driver specification for example a new control function like arm_spi_select_ss . thank you for your support. best regards joachim
