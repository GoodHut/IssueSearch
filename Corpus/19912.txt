 URL : "https://github.com/pkg/xattr/issues/6" TITLE : api stutters a lot BODY : hi, while using the xattr package i noticed that the api stutters a lot, e.g. the xattrerror type needs to be referred to from external code as xattr.xattrerror . it would be much nicer to rename it to error , so that the referral would look like xattr.error instead. it's the same with the functions, xattr.get instead of xattr.getxattr would reduce the stutter a lot. are you interested in a pr which fixes this? if not, please feel free to close this issue and i'm going to live with the stutter ; .
