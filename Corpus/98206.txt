 URL : "https://github.com/JrCs/docker-crashplan/issues/41" TITLE : inbound backup not working BODY : my other crashplan clients on the internal network can't find the dockerized crashplan. i suspect it's because the inbound local-network address is the container's 172.x.x.x address. do you have any ideas on how to make this work? i'm not familiar enough with docker to know if it's possible to bridge it, and it doesn't seem possible to change the internal address without attempting to bind to an address that doesn't exist from the container's pov.
