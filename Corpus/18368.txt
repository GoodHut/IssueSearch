 URL : "https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/issues/5934" TITLE : switch case issue BODY : hello there, i'm hoping this is the right place to mention this. i'm not completely sure if i've found something interesting here... i probably should go and read the manual... trace hello ; var a:string = 0 ; var b:uint = 10; switch a { case 0 : if 10 == b break; dostuff ; case 1 : dostuff ; case 2 : dostuff ; } function dostuff :void{ trace pewpew ; } trace bye ; output: 1. hello 2. n/a 3. n/a 3. should output bye , but it will not since i used a break - in as3 adobe air , the code will still execute after the switch case , is this possible in haxe? what can i write to break out of the switch case ignore the dostuff function and still execute things after the switch case ? the only thing i've thought of, is doing: switch a { case 0 : if 10 == b { //do nothing... } else dostuff ; case 1 : } but to me, this feels like it's eliminating the whole point of using a switch case .
