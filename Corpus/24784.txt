 URL : "https://github.com/quoeradem/codex/issues/7" TITLE : toc missing styles BODY : the generated table of contents is no longer being styled. it looks like the top-level toc container is now missing the _classname_ prop, causing the css to not be applied. this was inadvertently caused by the upgrade to remark@^7.0.0 in 617fdb28cf48d84032c40d732946d5f5ec66f93c. the classname is being passed to the remark plugin in the _options_ object but is being ignored due to the changes to remark .
