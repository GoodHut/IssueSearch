 URL : "https://github.com/graphhopper/directions-api-js-client/issues/17" TITLE : add cross browser testing BODY : there are tools that allow automated testing in different browsers and os: https://saucelabs.com/open-source https://www.browserstack.com both are free for open-source software. would be nice to know in which browsers the lib works and in which it doesn't. i think we need to write selenium tests for this. maybe in combination with the demo i have no idea, haven't tried any of these tools .
