 URL : "https://github.com/awalker89/openxlsx/issues/248" TITLE : convert data to datatable BODY : it would be nice to have the insert > table functionality, so that i can convert a section of my worksheet into a filtered data table. currently i have to apply a filter to the whole worksheet, starting at some specified row currently using addfilter . i use the last row in the worksheet to calculate the rows above it, and when i then filter it, this row gets shuffled in. my current workaround is to apply the insert > table within excel, after exporting the worksheet.
