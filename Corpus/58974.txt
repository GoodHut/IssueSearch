 URL : "https://github.com/fetherston/npm-parrot-minidrone/issues/10" TITLE : swat re-discover issue BODY : hi, i'm using the library to control a swat drone. i have modified the drone.js code to support that and it sort of works. so thank you! the problem is with reconnecting - i'm able to connect to drone once or twice. the process exits every time but usually after the second or third reconnect, i'm just unable to discover the drone. note that it doesn't happen with the node-rolling-spider package... not that it means anything... i prefer to use your package... hope you can help and thanks in advance! dd.
