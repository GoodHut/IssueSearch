BODY : hei, it seems that you are making a tiny and neat library and it should be cross-platform since there are so many platform specific codes, i am looking for a small lib with cross-platform ability and your example code seems appealing, but i failed to build in windows10 with vs2015. ðŸ˜¢ , there are tons of mistakes. vi cl : command line warning d9002: ignoring unknown option '-m64', it seems that -m64 -fpic -pthread -lmbedtls -lmbedx509 -lmbedcrypto are for linux, but they are just warnning. vi error c2556: 'float htonf float ': overloaded function differs only by return type from 'unsigned int htonf float ' vi error c2371: 'htonf': redefinition; different basic types vi ... many many similar errors ... vi frnetlib\src\sslsocket.cpp 7 : fatal error c1083: cannot open include file: 'mbedtls/net_sockets.h': no such file or directory and the wrong messages is just too much, the first one i can understand, but i did not choose ssl at the very beginning, so why still need them? and the others just make me dizzy. so, 1.have you build on windows, or am i missing something important? hope will have a doc tell about how to build. 2.can i choose not to compile ssl at all? i am not so into cmake, so is it possible? thanks for your time.
