 URL : "https://github.com/hexchat/hexchat/issues/1923" TITLE : official mac os releases BODY : hey, i was installing osx builds from https://dl.hexchat.net/hexchat/osx/ the last of which was 2.10.2 and we are now on 2.12.4 so thats very far behind. i know we can build it via homebrew and install it but is there a reason why the app packages are not made available anymore? i prefer that method of install because it is easier to have it in applications without any icon issues and mapped to the dock. i can do the builds for the release if the team does not want to do this anymore just looking for some answers best, martell
