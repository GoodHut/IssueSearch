 URL : "https://github.com/2graphic/sinap-ide/issues/85" TITLE : collapsible list component BODY : the idea is to create a general purpose angular component that renders a collapsible list with title bar. users of the component can bind to listitems and title properties, and the component would display the title with the list beneath it. clicking on the title would toggle collapsed or expanded view. the list itself should behave as one would expect a generic listbox would behave.
