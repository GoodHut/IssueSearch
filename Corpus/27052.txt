 URL : "https://github.com/mrniko/netty-socketio/issues/471" TITLE : code example of ack BODY : hi, in the release notes, i noticed that there is support for sending ack. my use case is that the client has to send an ack to server once it receives the message and processes it. is there a code sample to show the same? can ack be sent on custom fields every message from the server has a unique message id and client is expected to send this id back to the server.
