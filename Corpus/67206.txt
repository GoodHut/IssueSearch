 URL : "https://github.com/Boucher-David/DraftKats/issues/25" TITLE : parse api response data BODY : we need to sort through our api data. it should grab key player information: no more than 4 or 5 pieces of information per player. when done, append all player data to app.config.playerdata . the server is much faster than the browser at executing javascript, so sort through the player data in server.js.
