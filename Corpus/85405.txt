 URL : "https://github.com/drennings/MindTheGap/issues/31" TITLE : extend the introduction s BODY : intro - i would focus more on really explaining where communication falls short, and how these tools aim to improve that should be more of a supporting factor - so as mentioned before, i would try to write more content on defining the issue the virtual 50m is almost skipped over imo, it's just mentioned really quick as an introduction - clearly explain why the four chosen dimensions are a problem, and why are they unique to gdse? - the text in the page is quite extensive, but could be justified considering that this intended to be a website. if there could be a way of reducing the amount of text in the page it could make it even better. - although it is a broad topic, the group seems to have narrowed down the scope to the tooling related to the presented challenges. maybe this should be more explicit at the beginning of the website.
