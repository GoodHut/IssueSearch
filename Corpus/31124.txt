 URL : "https://github.com/fractalclone/zephyr-riscv/issues/6" TITLE : rtos port to risc-v BODY : hello, i'm trying to port another rtos to risc-v and i'm following your instructions by porting zephyr to see if this can be done in a similar fashion. is it possible to push another small rtos other than zephyr, similarly with rocket cores to a zedboard by using vivado to generate another boot.bin ? will i only need the .elf file of my rtos or does it require other files ? could you please tell me what sort of files i can work with similarly and what files should i be able to provide of my rtos ? i'm assuming the .elf of my rtos shouldn't only be sufficient ? thank you very much.
