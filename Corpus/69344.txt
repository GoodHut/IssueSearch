 URL : "https://github.com/ohanhi/atom-highlight-bad-chars/issues/14" TITLE : swiss and french quotes BODY : hi. i really love your plugin. it is very helpful for copy-pasting text to atom. also for my students who are beginners in coding. there’s only a little thing, which is unnecessarily disturbing my eyes: « and » are quotes in swiss and french and they aren’t bad chars in utf8 documents. cheers, jürgen
