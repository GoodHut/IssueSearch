 URL : "https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix/issues/2496" TITLE : zuul's dynamic routing BODY : i think dynamic routing is one of the features of spring cloud zuul. if you modify the routing rules in the properties file, for the moment we can only update the rules by restarting zuul's service. this may be unfriendly to the gateway. by reading the source code i found that spring cloud has been prepared for the dynamic routing function, but the default simpleroutelocator does not implement refreshableroutelocator interface, which can not be completed dynamic routing capabilities. if you want to achieve dynamic routing function, we need to read the source code of zuul, and have some understanding of the source code to complete this function. the specific way to do dynamic routing is to extend the simpleroutelocator class and override the locateroutes method. this is difficult for the average user.
