 URL : "https://github.com/mabdelazim/Random-Access-Map/issues/2" TITLE : lack of license BODY : i think random access maps could be very useful for people in some situations e.g. in competitive programming , but since no license is given, it is not known whether it is okay to use this template. just a theoretical comment, i do not have any specific use in mind at the moment.
