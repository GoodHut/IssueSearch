 URL : "https://github.com/universAAL/tools.eclipse-plugins/issues/43" TITLE : run tool - rundir BODY : _originally opened: alexander marinc 2011-09-16 09:49:43_ _originally closed: 2011-09-19 09:30:23_ the run-tool do no create the rundir in the workspace folder. this is mainly needed to include the mv.bus.model folder and the sodapop.key file in this. in a new workspace the project will not start correct because of this...
i think best to fix this is that the run or build tool should create the rundir, including a standard version of the mw.bus.model\sodapop.key. -- from: _this issue has been automatically imported from our old issue tracker_
