 URL : "https://github.com/MoscaDotTo/Winapp2/issues/134" TITLE : enabled by default BODY : can you please enable by default all of the entries that do not have a warning and thus are not likely to cause a problem. because, after the winapp2 file has been added to ccleaner for the first time, it takes a long time to tick every box and un-tick the boxes that have warnings and may cause problems. thanks
