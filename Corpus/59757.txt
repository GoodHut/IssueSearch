 URL : "https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-docker-images/issues/248" TITLE : use docker healthcheck BODY : unless there is absolutely no doubt that a service will exit whenever it stops listening to a public port, it might be good to add a health check to the service. by using the dockerfile healthcheck command https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/ healthcheck , the status of a docker service is automatically monitored. it will exit the container for you if the service stops listening to its designated port. for the kafka container, for example, the command could be: dockerfile healthcheck --interval=1m --timeout=3s \ cmd nc -z localhost 9092 || exit 1 for a http container like schema-registry it could be dockerfile healthcheck --interval=1m --timeout=3s \ cmd curl --fail http://localhost:8081/ || exit 1 would this be something considering for the images in this repository? if not, would it be worth documenting the preferred health check for any given image in this repository?
