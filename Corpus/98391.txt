 URL : "https://github.com/tom-ando/jsBlog/issues/2" TITLE : interface for making posts BODY : a separate page that will generate the md for a post, with a preview maybe even a drag and drop based editor? . the page must only generate the md. for example, for the /posts/postlist.txt it should take the while file, append the changes, but then present the file back to the user copy and paste style , for them to manually put into the file themselves. this is because the whole setup needs to stay static, no exceptions
