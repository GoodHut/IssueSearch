 URL : "https://github.com/pbreuss/wikitude-ionic-2-starter-app/issues/5" TITLE : wikitude other examples BODY : thanks @pbreuss for making this starter project. i am wondering whether will you be interested to expand this repo to actually include all of wikitude examples? coming from non-js background, and i learnt typescript straight away... i think wikitude own examples are a little hard to follow compared to if i read from ionic 2 examples. if you are interested to work on it, i am keen to help. thanks!
