 URL : "https://github.com/Scorpil/docker-rust/issues/19" TITLE : alpine + rustup BODY : hi, @scorpil you mentionned https://github.com/scorpil/docker-rust/issues/12 issuecomment-285279523 wanting to add alpine variant. have you started working on this ? if not i'd like to help : would it be appropriate to build the alpine image with rustup in the same pr ? i've looked at the repository quickly, but i want to make sure before starting, tell me if i've misunderstood something: the py files in /manage/ are helpers, mainly create.py create the dockerfiles & build.py build the image from the dockerfiles and tag them. i probably will have to edit at least build.py /templates/ contains the dockerfile template that are used by create.py , i'll have to add dockerfile_alpine.mustache and maybe dockerfile_alpine_onbuild.mustache docker-tags.yml might need some extra info for rustup anything else ?
