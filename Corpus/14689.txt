 URL : "https://github.com/EventGhost/EventGhost/issues/158" TITLE : bug report format BODY : i have noticed. in the forum under the beta bug reports. because i have that template that shows pow right in your face. and i do know it's annoying but that's the point it works. people are formatting the bug reports in a consistent manner. and there is no need to ask for this information. it has really simplified the process for us as well as the user. is there a way to do this same king of thing here as well??
