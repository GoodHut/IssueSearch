 URL : "https://github.com/cfe-lab/Kive/issues/659" TITLE : hide unpublished pipelines BODY : on the analysis page, unpublished pipelines are not supposed to be included in the drop-down menus, unless the user is a developer. it looks like that filter got lost when we switched to building the table from an ajax call. add a new query parameter called is_published , and set it when the user is not a developer. it looks like a serializer was implemented for this, but never used. instead of having a separate serializer and figuring out how to switch serializers, i suggest setting a flag on the serializer during its __init__ method. that method has access to the request through kwargs 'context' 'request' .
