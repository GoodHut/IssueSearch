 URL : "https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/PyMultiNest/issues/92" TITLE : prior convergence warning BODY : pymultinest is raising the warning that parameters are converging to the prior limit. but with the same prior definition emcee is giving fine results. i know both algorithms are different. what causes this converging warning? even if it is showing the warning, it calculates the log evidence, so can we trust that result?
