 URL : "https://github.com/codelibs/fess/issues/1281" TITLE : labels - include path BODY : hi, i have some problems getting the labels attached to some specific paths while using the labels include paths option. i have one file crawler to crawl a windows share with the following settings: file crawler || ------------|---------- name | root-crawler path | smb://root/ the rest are the default values. and then i have created multiple labels to label some folders under root . label-a || ------------|---------- name | label-a value | labela include paths | smb://root/a/ label-b || ------------|---------- name | label-b value | labelb include paths | smb://root/b/ label-c || ------------|---------- name | label-c value | labelc include paths | smb://root/c/ i'd asssume that the subfolders /root/a /root/b /root/c get labeld with the corresponding defined labels but nothing happens. it seems like that the labels included paths option is ignored for any crawled document. regarding to the issue 990 i also tried another regex for the included paths like smb://root/a/. with no luck. any ideas how to use the labels with just a single crawler?
