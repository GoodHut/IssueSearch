BODY : am i an idiot? hint: i probably am but :help grepper doesn't return anything. sorry, no help for grepper i can't find anything in :help that matches grepper either? i note there is no tags file in doc, does that matter? i am using vim-plug, i've tried on both my windows and linux boxes. i've tried running: :call plug helptags but that didn't work either. on a scale of 1-10, how dumb am i? :
