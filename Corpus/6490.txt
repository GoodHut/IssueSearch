 URL : "https://github.com/transifex/openformats/issues/71" TITLE : add pot support BODY : if messages.pot is used as source file for auto-update on transifex.com, update returns following error found empty msgid. as a workaround we've generated english translation po file and put it into source repository. this is suboptimal, because now we have english po file and messages.pot template file in the repo. it'd be really nice to have support of pot files, because pot po template files are designed to be source files for translation.
