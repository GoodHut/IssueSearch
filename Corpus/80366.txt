BODY : thank you for making this available. i'm working with https://portlandb.us trying to improve transit in portland, or. one thing that would help us is if we could process the saved data to locate congestion points in the city. we would like to be able to show the transportation department where some quick fixes might be possible. have you already written any tools that might identify where slowdowns are occurring? thanks!
