 URL : "https://github.com/mcenderdragon/Futurepack-API/issues/269" TITLE : suggestions and issues BODY : i suggest to add liquid bioterium, glowtite, retium, quantium, wakurium since liquid neon exist. i suggest to add a compatibily with tinkers construct for the liquid metals. i noticed the quantium block is currently called quantanium . the quantium and wakurium bricks name don't display well, it display the full class name. i suggest too to add wakurium and quantium crystal block and sand to the generation to the tyros generation for making it more interesting and unique.
