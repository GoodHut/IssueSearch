 URL : "https://github.com/vitalets/react-native-extended-stylesheet/issues/60" TITLE : multiple math operators BODY : currently only 1 operator is supported, so if i have to do the following i can't js { height: '$deviceheight/2-100' } instead i have to do js { $halfdeviceheight: '$deviceheight/2', height: '$halfdeviceheight-100' } so for many operators this becomes unnecessary & this happens for quite a few use cases that i've encountered in the past few weeks or so
