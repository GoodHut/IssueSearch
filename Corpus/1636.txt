variable id : interp from -> interp from. goal @ eq foo_comp uarrow from from id id id . intros. set printing all. simpl. reflexivity.
qed. @ herbelin on 2009-07-09 00:54:51 +0200 fixed in trunk and branch v8.2 revision 12233 . fixed means that simpl does not apply in this case the unfolding of the constant is not reversible . hugo
