 URL : "https://github.com/fullstackreact/react-native-oauth/issues/34" TITLE : client_secret in code BODY : hi ari, i am new to the oauth topic and it's nice that you created that lib. one thing i was wondering about is that i have to put the client_secret in the code that runs on the device. in a lot of articles and videos on the authorization code grant flow, they said that the client_secret should stay on the server. do i miss something? best tizian
