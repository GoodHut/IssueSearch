 URL : "https://github.com/gjb2048/moodle-format_grid/issues/47" TITLE : v2.9.1.8 broken in ie8 BODY : i know it's an old ie version but we found a simple one line fix so thought we'd share back. in ie8 only the first and last grid elements open up in the modal, all other grid elements produce the following error when clicked: > can't move the focus to the control because it is invisible, not enabled, or of a type that does not accept the focus. if you open modal with first or last and use arrows to navigate the other sections just appear blank. issue is on line 252: > firstactivity.focus ; the .focus is being called before ie has time to render the content so if a small timeout is added before the focus it fixes it. > settimeout function { firstactivity.focus ; }, 10 ;
