 URL : "https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/marbles/issues/79" TITLE : app allows double spending BODY : when transferring a marble to party b, during the transfer there can be a refresh and the marble appears back in the transferor's a account. the transferor is able to then transfer the same marble to another transferee c . eventually the blocks catch up and the audit will show that the marble was owned by a, then b, then c. it was not b that initiated the transfer to c. if using this as a demo, it creates confusion and raises challenges to the integrity of the blockchain.
