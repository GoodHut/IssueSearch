 URL : "https://github.com/zero-os/0-stor/issues/436" TITLE : add server docs BODY : we should create create some high level server docs, that quickly summarize how the zstor server works, and link to the relevant godocs and/or files for the internals. on top of that we should ensure that the godocs are also complete for the server packages and ensure they can stand on their own. as part of this we should also remove the server specs as those specs have all been implemented , and we can copy out of their the knowledge that can also serve as docs.
