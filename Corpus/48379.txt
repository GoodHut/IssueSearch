 URL : "https://github.com/haoweilo/RTSP_stream_server/issues/3" TITLE : rstp server by demand BODY : is there any options to adjust rstp server throttling by demand or something like that? i mean, most of the time i have zero connections to this server and no need to spend more power in this mode. will be awesome to have any options to pause/adjust server if there is no any connections established.
