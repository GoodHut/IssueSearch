 URL : "https://github.com/adamcooke/staytus/issues/120" TITLE : email link didn't change BODY : i originally had the site url set to subdomain.website.com, however, i changed it to website:5000 instead. now, emails sent out still link to the old url. i can't find any way to change this url aside from the settings and i'm not sure why the mail template still uses the old url.
