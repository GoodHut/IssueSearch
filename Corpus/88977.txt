 URL : "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7880" TITLE : peek operation for queues BODY : peeking queues would be a useful addition for multi threaded tensorflow applications. for example, an environment in reinforcement learning might cache some observations in a queue. it should have an observation operation that always returns the current observation by peeking from that queue. a step operation then receives the action and removes the first element of the observations queue.
