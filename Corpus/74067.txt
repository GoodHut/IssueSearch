 URL : "https://github.com/aegif/CmisSync/issues/756" TITLE : does not work on kubuntu BODY : this might come in harsh but after spending over 24 hours am not in the mood to sweet talk. the ubuntu app is poorly written and tested. first off, it does not pull in all the dependencies during install and they are no documentation on the required dependencies on the wiki page for linux. i had to hunt google and issues page to pull all the dependencies from raised issues. before the system.io.filenotfoundexception: could not load file or assembly 'system.core, version=4.0.0.0, culture=neutral, publickeytoken=b77a5c561934e089' or one of its dependencies. file name: 'system.core, version=4.0.0.0, culture=neutral, publickeytoken=b77a5c561934e089' at cmissync.program.main system.string args <0x41912a50 + 0x000ff> in <filename unknown>:0 error fatal unhandled exception: system.io.filenotfoundexception: could not load file or assembly 'system.core, version=4.0.0.0, culture=neutral, publickeytoken=b77a5c561934e089' or one of its dependencies. file name: 'system.core, version=4.0.0.0, culture=neutral, publickeytoken=b77a5c561934e089' at cmissync.program.main system.string args <0x41912a50 + 0x000ff> in <filename unknown>:0 went away. then i came across below gtk-warning : unable to locate theme engine in module_path: adwaita , why an application would be hard written to only work with a particular theme is beyond me, anyway i installed the theme and even when i got no more errors, the application still does not show up. still doesnt work. applications like this give linux a bad name. better it be scrapped completely to save time of anyone.
