 URL : "https://github.com/react-tools/react-table/issues/629" TITLE : multi level header BODY : we are trying to build a pivot table out of react-table but then there is just one thing that is missing - multi level headers. at this point , we can only have a maximum of 2 level of header. not anything beyond that. kindly add provision to accept multiple level of headers. we can follow the same format where we can keep on adding columns inside each column. reference - orb.js has multiple level of headers - http://orbjs.net/
