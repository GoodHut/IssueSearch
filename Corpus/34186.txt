 URL : "https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/sw-precache/issues/334" TITLE : caching google oauth BODY : i m writing single paged app using react and node as back-end. i have a trouble with google oauth and sw-precache. i don t know how to explain what i have properly, but i ll try. oauth is written with passportjs and passport-google-oauth , so i have 2 end-points to serve oauth and everything works fine untill i enable sw-precache. it will send me index.html instead of redirecting to google auth page. any ideas how to fix that?
