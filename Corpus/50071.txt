 URL : "https://github.com/libtom/libtomcrypt/issues/300" TITLE : version 1.18.0 soname BODY : while passing the rc4 to several distros it was discovered that the libraries' abi version should be bumped to 1:0 because of the modified structs. that was discovered while testing against dropbear. is there a reason we should invest time to keep 1.18.0 abi compatible? one reason could be that our plans to further extend the library would lead to an abi 2:0 in the next release... i'm now highlighting some persons whose opinion i'd like to hear resp. a :+1: for okay to bump. @apjanke @buggywhip @fperrad @jforissier i guess you don't care about the abi version as you're always static linking : @karel-m @lvc @mkj @rofl0r @stapelberg the persons mentioned can happily trigger more people to vote.
