 URL : "https://github.com/kaivi/riek/issues/41" TITLE : validator required ? BODY : hello! it seems to me that rieinput _requires_ a validation function or else it always fails validation. here https://github.com/kaivi/riek/blob/master/src/riebase.js l52 if there is no validator set, the state is set as invalid. rieinput is never given a validator that defaults to true. this is a breaking change from earlier versions and i suspect it's a bug because the docs mark validator as optional.
