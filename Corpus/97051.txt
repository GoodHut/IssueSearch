 URL : "https://github.com/wavelab/libwave/issues/187" TITLE : fix finding kindr in cmake BODY : sub-issue of 45 the correct way to require kindr is find_package kindr cmake find_package kindr required include_directories ${kindr_include_dirs} the current findkindr.cmake should be removed or replaced. currently it simply lists an absolute path which is not correct for most users. removal may require some old users to change configuration or reinstall kindr.
