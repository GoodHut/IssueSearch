'italic' : 'normal', // italic 'font-weight': !this.isunchanged ? 'bold' : 'normal', // normal 'font-size': this.isspecial ? '24px' : '8px', // 24px }; return styles; } should imho be considered as don't example - it binds a method in the view ngclass = setclasses which is discouraged and should be avoided except one knows what she's doing - it returns a new instance for every call. if it would at least cache the result in an instance field and return that as long as not dependencies are changed, it would be ok.
