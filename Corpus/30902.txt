 URL : "https://github.com/thomaskuestner/GadgetronControl/issues/4" TITLE : reload config files BODY : erroneous visualization of modified but unsaved pipelines: after modification without saving of gadgetron configs in pipeline configurator -> leave configurator -> reenter into same config file -> modified pipeline was kept in visualization scope instead of reloaded from unmodified version config file on hdd is untouched, i.e. just visualization issue => solution: refresh config file from hdd, see 1
