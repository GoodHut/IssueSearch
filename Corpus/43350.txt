 URL : "https://github.com/LSTS/dune/issues/97" TITLE : cpu times overflows ? BODY : i'm thinking of the vars in resources::getprocessorusage. what happens if the tmp var that stores the /proc/stat values overflow ? i guess you could get some large values on a long running system. when doing the diff between new_cpu and old_cpu you'll get funny results... or even when computing cpu total in core::cputotal . or am i missing something ?
