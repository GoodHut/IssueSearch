 URL : "https://github.com/etenoch/qlicker/issues/128" TITLE : cfs:gridfs is deprecated BODY : it seems risky to depend on it, but not sure what the best alternative would be. one can store files directly in a mongo collection file size limit 8 or 16mb i think? - which is fine for images or directly into gridfs, but i'm not sure what the best way would be to get the image files back out in the form you need for <img src>. there are alternative packages, but i'm not sure how supported they are... it's a little annoying that all the documentation online refers to fs-collection... it's also odd that the community hasn't picked up the maintenance of the cfs packages...
