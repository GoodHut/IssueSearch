 URL : "https://github.com/matiboy/angular2-prettyjson/issues/8" TITLE : aot issue ? BODY : hi ! first of all, let me thank you for this module because it's really helpful for debugging. :+1: one thing tho, i'm now using it with angular-cli beta.24 and as soon as i import the prettyjsonmodule i get : error in prettyjsonmodule is not an ngmodule . i was using your module in beta.22 and i didn't have that problem. since aot checking was enabled by default in beta.23, i think the problem might come from there. did you build this module aot compatible and i'm missing something or is it possible that the module is not yet aot compatible ? cheers !
