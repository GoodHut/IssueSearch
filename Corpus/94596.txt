BODY : we have a hack due to lack of async reset in chisel to blackbox every single asyncreset register. previously, we had no parameterized black boxes, so we had to wrap every single one. now, @jackkoenig has added experimental? parameterized black boxes. this seems like a good use case for it that would save a lot of cruft. should i work on using parameterized black boxes for this? or is this a waste of time because experimental, or async is really coming soon, or it will break too many people's constraints ?
