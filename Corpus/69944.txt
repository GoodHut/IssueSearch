 URL : "https://github.com/zealdocs/zeal/issues/786" TITLE : unreadable fonts on 0.4 BODY : i was a happy zeal user until 0.4 came out. sadly the new release introduced a bug regarding font size: ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1256049/31167211-940e1e70-a8f1-11e7-8b19-a3d382bf4ae5.png as you can see here, fonts for the menus and docset names are so small they are almost unreadable. i kept the topbar in the screenshot for scale as my topbar has a font size of 10pt it started as soon as i upgraded to 0.4. i am on arch linux, with awesome window manager on x.org. my current version of zeal comes from arch repos and is community/zeal 1:0.4.0-1. please let me know if i can help with more info,logs,confs or anything else or if i can perform some additional operations/checks to help you with this. i like zeal and i would like to have the new version working :smiley:
