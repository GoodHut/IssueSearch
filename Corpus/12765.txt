 URL : "https://github.com/africanmathsinitiative/Instat/issues/2446" TITLE : right click menu BODY : i like the right-click menu now. but there are some very small points to correct. 1. in particular duplicate column and convert to date should each have ... after them. this is the rule when they call a dialogue. 2. put duplicate column... after rename column... in the right-click menu. 3. put convert to ordered factor just under convert to factor . 4. duplicate doesn't yet have an entry in the organise menu. it could perhaps go just under calculations, in the organise > column: calculate menu? if easy i would prefer the duplicated column to come just after the column it is duplicating? but only if very easy to do.
