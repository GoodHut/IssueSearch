 URL : "https://github.com/betterup/devise-doorkeeper/issues/12" TITLE : how to test? BODY : hi there, i've finally gotten minitest of doorkeeper before_action :doorkeeper_authorize! protected controllers by creating the user/oauth_application/access_token with all the proper fields working. when i move to before_action :authenticate_user! with devise-doorkeeper , it fails with: expected response to be a <2xx: success>, but was a <401: unauthorized> response body: { error : you need to sign in or sign up before continuing. } the same controller code with authenticate_user! works fine outside the test. is there anything else to consider in the testing? or an example? thanks in advance!
