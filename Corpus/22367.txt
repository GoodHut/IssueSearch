BODY : i just realized that you killed the old tar balls that i've been reyling on which is admittedly my own mistake, so i'm not complaining! :- i am going to fork this repo now to be safe in the future, but just for the record i would suggest you keep the old images around a bit longer. or was there a reason why they should be immediately updated? anyway, thanks for this, it's much appreciated!
