 URL : "https://github.com/Praqma/Praqmatic-Automated-Changelog/issues/104" TITLE : add existing template BODY : i created a template for pac when i was still in rigspolitiet, which never made it back to pac. the reason was that it used github heavily, and requires user information login/password from whomever is using it, and that it be comitted into the repository. i dont have a solution for that problem, but i can add the template. is it fine with a pull request where i add the template and then just forsake the settings, writing {github-username} and {github-password/token} together with a readme?
