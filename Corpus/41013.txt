BODY : thank for your great work! about your work, can i ask some notation? in 3.2.1 simple generative model, equation 2 ... if z_i = 0 all i in l_k^c i think that l_k^c has ti and bi, so zi always is 1... why is there z_i=0 in l_k^c? what did i misunderstand..? is z in roipooling's parameter? like objectness?... but it seems not..
