 URL : "https://github.com/ThomasTimm/ur_modern_driver/issues/115" TITLE : ur3 doesn't move on 3.3.4 BODY : i just got a ur3 running 3.3.4. i'm testing with just moveit through the rviz plugin , ur_modern_driver, and robot_state_publisher. it seems that i can connect to the ur3 properly, since i see messages on /joint_states with the arm state, but trajectories issued through moveit result in no motion. specifically, i see the trajectory published on /follow_joint_trajectory/goal, and ur_modern_driver replies with /follow_joint_trajectory/status messages, but never a /follow_joint_trajectory/result message. the status messages continue to be sent forever, indicating that it's expecting the robot to move but it never does . as a side note, i've not set reverse_port, since i couldn't find any documentation on what that is used for. unsure if that's at all related. i'm next going to try the ros_control usage pattern of this package, but not sure that'll be any different.
