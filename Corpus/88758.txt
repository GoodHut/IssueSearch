 URL : "https://github.com/nextcloud/nextcloudpi/issues/28" TITLE : option for using duckdns? BODY : i prefer to use duckdns.org for my dynamic dns, as it doesn't require me to log in and confirm that i'm still using it every so often and it is free. it has very good documentation and now supports txt record for use with letsencrypt. duckdns spec http://www.duckdns.org/spec.jsp . is it possible to get support for it added along with no-ip?
