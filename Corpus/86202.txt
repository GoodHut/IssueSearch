 URL : "https://github.com/wdfox/Confidence_Scanner/issues/1" TITLE : handling funny characters BODY : @tomdonoghue -- just did a little bit of messing around with the way special characters are handled in beatifulsoup. it looks to me like they simply get preserved in their natural form although i have only tried it with greek letters . do we want to keep words that contain special characters in our body of text for an article or pr or should i get rid of any words containing non-ascii.lower characters? my initial though is to leave them in for the analysis. at worst they will be disregarded, as they don't do much for the 'confidence' of the writing. also, if we decide to normalize against the length of the abstract or pr, it would be worth having them in there. let me know what you think.
