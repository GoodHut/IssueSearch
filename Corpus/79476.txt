 URL : "https://github.com/i18next/i18next/issues/862" TITLE : show namespace in cimode BODY : would it be possible to implement cimode so it also gives namespace. i understand that namespace isn't 1 to 1 usually due to fallback . but i would expect it to provide the initial namespace it looked in. so if the default namespace is changed for an instance of t then it would provide that. or if an explicit namespace was provide in the t call e.g. t 'special_namspace:some_key' it would provide special_namespace thoughts?
