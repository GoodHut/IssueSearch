 URL : "https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq-providers-kubernetes/issues/196" TITLE : get rid of old_ems_id BODY : archiving used to clear ems_id and store it in old_ems_id . old_ems_id is unnecessary now that we retain ems_id since https://github.com/manageiq/manageiq/pull/15251 and related prs . - x backfill unset ems_id from old_ems_id â€” seems https://github.com/manageiq/manageiq-schema/pull/18 already did that? - drop any code checking old_ems_id / old_ext_management_system . - delete the column. :fire: :dragon: @miq-bot add-label technical-debt
