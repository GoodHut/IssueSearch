 URL : "https://github.com/vbence86/fivenations/issues/203" TITLE : reduce docker image size BODY : as a project owner, i'd like to reduce the size of the generated docker images so that we could minimise the maintenance cost of aws ec2 instance. a/c - the current docker image uses the ubuntu:14.04 image to inherit from which makes the docker image take up more then 700mb . as this is undeniably leads us to an overuse of the available space resulting in unresonable maintenance costs, we have to use a smaller an more suitable parent image file - the docker image inherist from alpine linux image that can be found at https://github.com/mhart/alpine-node - current maintenance costs will be reduced ! screenshot from 2017-04-25 09-05-03 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6104164/25374703/567c2258-2996-11e7-832a-d2db18e058d6.png
