 URL : "https://github.com/cherab/core/issues/9" TITLE : solps grid integrator BODY : current version of the emission models defaults to the numericalintegrator step=x cm . the class essentially performs numerical integration using the given step size. a potentially much faster and more powerful solution is to use the kd-tree to find all intersecting cells and calculate their traversal lengths analytically. this should lead to a much faster and more accurate calculation method.
