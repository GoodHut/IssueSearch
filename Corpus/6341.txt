 URL : "https://github.com/pixijs/pixi-sound/issues/53" TITLE : add amd support BODY : it is more requirement rather than a feature request. lets take a look at pixi-plugin-example 1 . as you can see, at this lines 2 plugin have to be attached to global pixi variable as well as to be exported as a standalone module with its dependencies. at some point, this repo\plugin brokes one of the main approaches of how pixi.js is functioning. currently, there are a lot of module loaders that are built on top of amd. i'm one of that users. solution for me could be: - remove module loading definition, dependency management, etc. from the whole project - totally not what i'll do. - replace pixi-sound with some other sound library that is not part of pixi- package. - add amd support to this plugin asap. 1 : https://github.com/pixijs/pixi-plugin-example 2 : https://github.com/pixijs/pixi-plugin-example/blob/master/src/index.js l7-l9
