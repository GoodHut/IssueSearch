 URL : "https://github.com/NFFT/nfft/issues/54" TITLE : remove or fix iters2 BODY : the application iters2 is currently not functional. the module iters2 was added in 2006 by @jenskeiner to the trunk. since 2012 the file applications/iters2/readme says this example is currently not functional . as far as i can see, the code has not been functional in any nfft release it first appeared in version 3.2.0 . so i would suggest to remove the code of iters2 in the upcoming release unless anyone wants to provide a fix. alternatively, we could just remove the folder from make dist . what is your opinion on this?
