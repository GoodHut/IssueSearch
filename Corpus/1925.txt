 URL : "https://github.com/mustafauysal/bp-stories/issues/1" TITLE : make it real BODY : this plugin could be handy for the future bp based social networks, but the biggest trouble is; stories feature is originally invented for mobile apps, it perfectly fits build-in sexy ui and engagement is super simple. i can't say same thing for the web my tricky solution: input : let users upload standard file input items. images+video output : fetch the latest items that uploaded in latest 24h. further : recording videos with webcam also making sense. pr and ideas are welcome.
