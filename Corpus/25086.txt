 URL : "https://github.com/olafurpg/scalafmt/issues/811" TITLE : use hocon properly BODY : while i don't think that, necessarily, the way that hocon does things is the end-all be-all of configuration management, i do think that the some of the issues i've been having with scalafmt's configuration could've been avoided if hocon were used properly. specifically: + using a reference.conf file to define the base defaults + using include files for the style overlays + resolving the configuration before reading from it + using += instead of inventing align.tokens.add
