 URL : "https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat/issues/1867" TITLE : create smoke test hook BODY : health checks are great, but they should be cheap and quick to run. we should add a new hook type that lets a plan author define a more rigious test which will be run after update - smoke test. a smoke test, if defined, should be run before we determine if a service was updated successfully. if it fails, we should enter into a failed state and wait for operator intervention.
