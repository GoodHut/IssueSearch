BODY : nova works fine on my meteorapp.com subdomain, but i'm getting a 405 error when i access the site from my domain cname to meteor . how can i fix this? fetch api cannot load http:// .meteorapp.com/graphql. response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: no 'access-control-allow-origin' header is present on the requested resource. origin 'http://www. .com' is therefore not allowed access. the response had http status code 405.
