 URL : "https://github.com/Elgg/Elgg/issues/10803" TITLE : cron/run is unreliable BODY : i would not rely on cron/run at this moment as the way the cron determines which ts to check/run is wrong. it uses the endtime of the previous run to determine if execution is needed. i would like to see it determined on some modulo time instead. currently because of the bug mentioned here: 10797 it works, but if that bug is fixed it will break cron/run. if a hourly cron finishes at 10:30 started at 10:00 the next hourly will be 11:30. i expect based on cron/hourly that cron/run should kick the hourly cron at 10:00 and the next one at 11:00. instead of determining the need to run a specific interval based on the ts in the database it should determine it based on the start ts of the cron.
