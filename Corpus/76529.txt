 URL : "https://github.com/iChun/Morph/issues/915" TITLE : legacy repo missing code BODY : hi, i cloned the repo to build a copy that doesn't crash with the latest version of optifine. i've got everything working and building successfully but it looks like the morph-beta-0.9.3 changes were never published in this repo. the master branch appears to be version 0.9.1 with updated mob lists and the legacy1710 branch appears to be version 0.9.2. any chance the missing code could be added to this repo? i realize it's technically no longer supported but i feel there is a difference in help me thing broke and git history missing.
