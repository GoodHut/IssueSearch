 URL : "https://github.com/opentraffic/reporter/issues/70" TITLE : batch tiles to datastore BODY : we need a way to move tiles out of a given kv store and into a place where the datastore is expecting them. we'll do this with a configuration parameter. i think we need to support putting them to disk as well as posting them to s3 with possibly an authenitcation handshake . we also need to define the file naming conventions and what the contents of the file will be formatted to. for the file name lets do: numeric.date.time_numeric.tile.id_some.reporter.instance.uuid for the stuff in the file we can do human readable: segment_id, next_segment_id, start_time, end_time, length, queue_length
