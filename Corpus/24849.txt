 URL : "https://github.com/pombase/website/issues/269" TITLE : trivial order swap BODY : on the phenotype ontology term pages, can we swap the order of these 2 links around: single-allele genotypes associated with this term ... genes from single-allele genotypes associated with this term ... i think most/many people will still want the gene lists by default...and you can already see the alleles/genotypes in the term view page so it makes sense to put the gene list in the more prominent position in fact, now we have separate boxes for single and multi allele phenotypes on this page http://pombase2.aska.gen.nz/term/fypo%3a0001128 perhaps it would be better to a move these 2 links inside the single allele frame b shorten the names accordingly to i gene list ii gene/allele list or similar?
