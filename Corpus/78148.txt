 URL : "https://github.com/multunus/autonomous-rc-car/issues/8" TITLE : plan to add new features BODY : we are implementing the same project, there is another repo here https://github.com/hamuchiwa/autorccar . as that repo uses the haar cascade method to detect traffic signals and stops signs but the issue is that repo uses the client-server method which sacrifices the framerate of cam stream and other processing resources . we needed your help to modify the code and add features of detect sign boards and other stuff.
