 URL : "https://github.com/informatics-isi-edu/chaise/issues/1094" TITLE : confusing logout flow BODY : when i use the logout button on the current chaise recordset app, using globus auth provider in webauthn, while logged in via a globus id account, i am presented with a page from auth.globus.org like this: logged out of globus auth you have successfully logged out. if you are using a shared computer, please ensure you have also logged out of any identity providers used during your session, and shut down this browser to remove any session cookies. to make sure your account is secure, ou may need to log out of the following identity providers: - globus id --- log out www.globusid.org/logout continue to https://synapse-dev.isrd.isi.edu/chaise/logout it's this last link that i think is wrong. as far as i can tell, i'm already logged out of webauthn by this point, so i'm not sure why i need to go to another logout app. this page just offers a link that invokes chaiseapp which seems to then redirect to /chaise/search . 1. it seems to me we should just offer the continue to site option directly as the link in the globus auth logout page. why go through two interstitials showing essentially the same verbiage about cookies and sessions? 2. i don't think the chaiseapp thing should redirect to /chaise/search anyway. shouldn't it go to the site homepage, or some deployment-configurable location? i'm not sure if this is solely a chaise ux issue or relates to some confusion or misuse of the webauthn logout api? is there some technical reason we want/need this extra layer of interstitial page? @ljpearlman @robes @hongsudt
