 URL : "https://github.com/ALiVEOS/ALiVE.OS/issues/446" TITLE : ai moving off the map BODY : the issue is, that i can see that entities appear outside the actual playable maps. happens in all of my missions, sooner or later. sometimes after 20-30 minutes, sometimes it takes a few hours. there is in my case nothing to do in order to reproduce the problem. i built the attached map fresh, because i wanted to make sure that there are no outdated/copied/corrupted modules in there. so in theory this should be a simple and clean alive setup. still the problem occurs. this is confusing. maybe its not a bug and i am doing something wrong on a very basic level? but then what? files.zip https://github.com/aliveos/alive.os/files/1404210/files.zip
