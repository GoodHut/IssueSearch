 URL : "https://github.com/mvoidex/hsdev/issues/65" TITLE : whois / file not found BODY : i've been trying to get sublimehaskell working, but have been having issues. after noticing some hsdev related errors in the console output, i decided to try the corresponding hsdev commands from the cli. here is one example, for which i get the same result in the cli as i do in the sublime console: $ ~/.cabal/bin/hsdev start server started at port 4567 $ ~/.cabal/bin/hsdev whois main -f ./areaundercurve.hs { error : other error , msg : file '/users/ken/documents/haskellexperiments/area/areaundercurve.hs' not found } $ ls ./areaundercurve.hs ./areaundercurve.hs any ideas on how this can happen? apologies if i'm doing something wrong, i'm extremely new to haskell and its toolset.
