 URL : "https://github.com/sp614x/optifine/issues/469" TITLE : cem and keypoint animation BODY : i made a model larger than the original pig. but the model doesn't work because the head is too far from the original pig's head position. so, in-game, when this mob turns his head, it's goes too far from the body and float in the air. like this : ! a2 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25582255/22642730/3e3938a6-ec5c-11e6-88f1-4026160b1bf1.png it's happened because i can't change the keypoint of the original animation of the pig. you can see below that the mob have odd animation for the head and the leg, because the keypoint for the animation of the pig are below the keypoint wanted for my mob. ! a1 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25582255/22642720/3524ad9a-ec5c-11e6-8e17-545241125a0c.jpg so, i would like to be able to change theses keypoint to make bigger mob than minecraft. you can download the pack with the cem part here : https://mega.nz/ !plfq1bzq
