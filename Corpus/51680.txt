 URL : "https://github.com/red-hat-storage/rhcephpkg/issues/100" TITLE : bail on undefined args BODY : the rhcephpkg commands should bail if the user specifies an unrecognized argument. for example, this should fail with an error: rhcephpkg build --distro xenial ... and tell the user that the argument --distro is unrecognized, and --dist is the only valid one. maybe check if self.parser.unknown_commands , or is there some more elegant way to do this?
