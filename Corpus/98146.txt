 URL : "https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/issues/2784" TITLE : improve note accessibility BODY : problem description after 2710, notes are less accessible. we need to add the note type to the note title, so that people with color blindness and other color-differentiating issues can still discern the note severity and type. one suggestion is to modify the css and use the :before selector to add the content of either note: , important: , or warning: before the note title. please don't use javascript to do this, as we already have too much javascript in the site. relates to 2781 problem location <!-- help us find the problem quickly by choosing one of these. --> - i saw a problem on the following url: <url> - i couldn't find the information i wanted. i expected to find it near the following url: <url> - other: <details> project version s affected <!-- if this problem only affects specific versions of a project like docker engine 1.13 , tell us here. the fix may need to take that into account. --> suggestions for a fix <!--if you have specific ideas about how we can fix this, let us know. --> <!-- to improve this template, edit the .github/issue_template.md file -->
