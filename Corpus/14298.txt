 URL : "https://github.com/sddm/sddm/issues/773" TITLE : add screen locker BODY : hi there, i am using gnome 3.22 with sddm and i realized this combination doesn't support a screen locking. it is like that because gdm has the screen locker feature, not gnome. the way it is today, gnome sends a dbus message to gdm that will lock the screen. a message like that dbus-send --type=method_call --dest=org.gnome.screensaver \ /org/gnome/screensaver org.gnome.screensaver.lock 1 i think it is pretty reasonable that sddm could screen locking. it could respond after a method call or a dbus message like gdm. this feature would make it more usable. i also would love to add this feature, i just would need someone to ask question regarding the code structure and practices. reference: 1 http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/86221/how-can-i-lock-my-screen-in-gnome-3-8-without-gdm
