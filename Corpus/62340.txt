 URL : "https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN/issues/43" TITLE : class imbalance for rpn BODY : hi, for my master thesis i am working on the topic of text detection in images and video frames. i implemented a modified version of faster r-cnn/mask r-cnn, which is very similar to your implementation, but tailored for text detection. on average there are ~54 positive text anchors in the images i use, which result in a mini batch of ~54 positive and ~200 negative examples per image i use mini batches of size 254 per image . the problem i encounter is that my network overfits on only negative prediction because on average, there are many more negative than positive examples . now a few simple solutions would be to 1 take a smaller mini batch size for example 112 , 2 to remove all the images in which there are not enough positive examples from the data set or 3 use a weighted loss function. i inspected your code very carefully, but as far as i can see in your implementation this doesn't seem to be an issue. was this positive/negative class imbalance also a problem in your implementation, and if so, how did you solve this problem? thanks! maurits
