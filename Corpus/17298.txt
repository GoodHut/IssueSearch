 URL : "https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/issues/410" TITLE : old layout option BODY : hi nico, it would be great to have the old single-column layout back at least as an option in the profile preferences. the multi-column layout as introduced in 1.6.0 looks very cluttered on bigger screens in my opinion. i prefer much more the old one. thanks! informations elabftw version visible in sysadmin panel : 1.6.0 installation method git, docker or zip archive : docker operating system + version : unix browser used firefox/chrome : chrome for git/zip installation method: php version: mysql version: webserver apache/nginx + version :
