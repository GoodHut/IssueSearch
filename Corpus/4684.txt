 URL : "https://github.com/VargaJoe/SenseNet-Preview-Cleaner/issues/4" TITLE : filter by path BODY : it would be useful if we could narrow the number of content items to a certain subtree by adding a path parameter, so that operators can clean up only a subset of the repository. > a more complex scenario would be to add an optional content query filter , but that is _out of scope_ for now, and would require a bigger effort, because currently this tool does not require an index to operate.
