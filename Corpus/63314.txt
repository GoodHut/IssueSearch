 URL : "https://github.com/riyazdf/cli/issues/97" TITLE : docker trust key-rotate BODY : allow for docker trust to rotate a key. this may not be the proper way of expressing this command because other docker trust key commands are for local key administration - not handling tuf metadata. it may be perfectly acceptable for this functionality to completely remain in notary for that reason.
