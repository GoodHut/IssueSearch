 URL : "https://github.com/coppit/docker-duckdns/issues/6" TITLE : ipv6 not working BODY : i am testing ipv6 support of your docker container, and it seems recent updates to the base image you use have removed the ifconfig command. the command seems to have been removed in versions after 0.9.18, likely due to the upgrade to ubuntu 16.04. installing the net-tools package seems to be the suggested solution.
