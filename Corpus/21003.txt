 URL : "https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/1670" TITLE : dns lookup is slow BODY : expected behavior near same latency connecting to example.com from container as from host. actual behavior connecting from container has ~2.5s latency. information this is probably a dupe of 446 which was closed due to lacking repro . i can't provide the output of the diagnosis tool because it crashes my computer. i'm running version 17.03.1-ce-mac12 17661 channel: stable d1db12684b steps to reproduce the behavior code to reproduce can be found at: https://github.com/larsnystrom/dfm-network-latency clone it, and then compare running curl from host and from the container. here are my results: $ curl -w '@format.txt' -o /dev/null -s http://example.com time_namelookup: 0,004 time_connect: 0,099 time_appconnect: 0,000 time_pretransfer: 0,099 time_redirect: 0,000 time_starttransfer: 0,193 ---------- time_total: 0,193 $ docker-compose up starting test-speed_1 attaching to test-speed_1 test-speed_1 | time_namelookup: 2.521 test-speed_1 | time_connect: 2.622 test-speed_1 | time_appconnect: 0.000 test-speed_1 | time_pretransfer: 2.622 test-speed_1 | time_redirect: 0.000 test-speed_1 | time_starttransfer: 2.720 test-speed_1 | ---------- test-speed_1 | time_total: 2.720 test-speed_1 exited with code 0
