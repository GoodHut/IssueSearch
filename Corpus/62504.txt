 URL : "https://github.com/shortbloke/home_assistant_config/issues/3" TITLE : complete backup off rpi BODY : currently github is used to store configuration files, except those excluded by .gitignore thus some key content is not uploaded and therefore not backed up - secrets.yaml , nest.conf , plex.conf which store passwords and api keys - home-assistant_v2.db - which stores all event and sensor history/data - home-assistant.log - the log file created in the current running instance. these files need to be kept secure, but also backed up to my on-prem storage server and/or to an offsite file storage solution, i.e. dropbox, onedrive etc. this needs to be done automatically and periodically.
