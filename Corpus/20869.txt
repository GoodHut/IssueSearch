 URL : "https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/2615" TITLE : debian stretch hvm BODY : i've been trying to set up a debian hvm in qubes. it works fine using debian jessie but after upgrade to stretch the screen is non-functional after login. it seems to be the same issue as described here in the kali installation issue 1981: i was wondering if anyone else is experiencing problems with installing kali on a hvm in qubes. when i boot the fresh installed kali hvm i see the logon screen fine, but after that i see the top op the screen in the lower 10% of the window. there was mention of adding the following lines to /etc/x11/xwrapper.conf allowed_users=anybody needs_root_rights: no but that doesn't seem to help.
