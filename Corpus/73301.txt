 URL : "https://github.com/stumpwm/stumpwm-contrib/issues/69" TITLE : cpu gives divide by zero BODY : i've been using stumpwm + cpu module for many years with no problems, but since i started using libvirt virt-manager + kvm/qemu the other day, i get about 3 crashes in three hours, plus same thing on another computer. both running arch linux, one with fairly recent stump 1db36707e67c0e729f6203cfd5712dac6aebb109 and stump-contrib 86b5ebdadfd9b079486f487812673fa8a28c69d3, the other computer is a fresh install, with current master of both. i can't get at the error message other than taking a picture. looks like something where the cpu module divides by zero? ! bug https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/619390/26274222/edd7c2e4-3d44-11e7-9cea-48b9b3172895.jpg
