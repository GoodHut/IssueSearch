 URL : "https://github.com/middleman-contrib/middleman-deploy/issues/131" TITLE : deploy.user not being set BODY : i'm attempting to deploy via rsync but for some reason in middleman-deploy 2.0 the user being set in .env and or deploy.user = ubuntu does not register during deploy. what's happening is it's taken the my user login of my macbook and using that in place. i know setting a global variable of my deploy user would work here but i'm trying to avoid doing that and hoping i can use a project specific work around. anyone come across this or have a solution? than you.
