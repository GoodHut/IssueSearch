 URL : "https://github.com/corneliucirlan/jquery-mdstrap/issues/6" TITLE : updating to jquery 3.2.1 BODY : hello corneliu, the plugin doesn't work with the latest version of jquery 3.2.1 , but is compatible with jquery from 2 major versions ago 1.10.2 . this is because of the use of the attribute selector has been deprecated. per this article, i updated the code to take in the name of the selector for now. https://api.jquery.com/selector/ looks like all you need to do to be up to date with the latest jquery is to make these modifications: lines 16-19 $.fn.mdstrap = function selector, options { // declare function variables var $menu = $ selector ; and lines 44-45 if $ 'ul' + selector .length !== 0 initialize settings, internal, $menu, $menuparent ; else console.error menu ' + selector + ' not available. ; i also noticed that .md-overlay was covering the entire screen and preventing clicking on menu items. i made this update to make sure that when it comes in from the left, that the css left attribute would have the size of the ul width property, like so: $ .navbar-toggler-icon .click function { $ .mds-overlay .css left , $ .ul .css width ; } ; thanks! aprille
