 URL : "https://github.com/WordPress/dashicons/issues/162" TITLE : social media icon request BODY : i saw that it was decided not to include instagram in dashicons in this ticket: https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/34166 but i'd like to request a reconsideration, it makes sense to me to include all the popular social media channels, not just twitter and facebook, in the name of keeping the number of additional fonts needed for a site to a minimum.
