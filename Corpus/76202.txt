 URL : "https://github.com/FreshPorts/freshports/issues/38" TITLE : integrate with portscout BODY : freshports should integrate with portscout and show information about new versions. portscout doesnâ€™t have an api per say, but the rss feeds are easy enough to monitor and contains information about new releases. https://portscout.freebsd.org/rss/rss.cgi?m=maintainer-email-address@freebsd.org suggestion for using the data: $package_name version $current_version is available in ports. the $package_name maintainer was notified about a new version $new_version_from_portscout on $date_from_feed.
