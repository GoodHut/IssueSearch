 URL : "https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/issues/7839" TITLE : build v1 as a multirepo BODY : lot of us currently using stable version and it would be much easier to migrate each component separately. so at the start we will be able to load components separately: javascript import { card, cardtext, cardactions } from 'material-ui'; import { button } from @material-ui/button ; idea from material-components https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web including-components . see lerna https://github.com/lerna/lerna .
