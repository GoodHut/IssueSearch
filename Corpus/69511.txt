 URL : "https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/643" TITLE : tests for planningscene BODY : moveit's planningscene https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/tree/kinetic-devel/moveit_core/planning_scene is at the core of many of the operations the framework performs. even so, the package's tests https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/blob/kinetic-devel/moveit_core/planning_scene/test/test_planning_scene.cpp contains only three tests. this needs to be extended to account for the many interfaces this class supports! you don't have to add tests for everything . but if you could contribute reasonable tests for some things, this would help a lot.
