 URL : "https://github.com/WoWManiaUK/Redemption/issues/745" TITLE : talent consumption - mage BODY : part of the main mage post 654 splitting it to help the devs keep track of what still needs fixing : consumption only allows 2 crits of fireball and pyroblast instead of 3. these spells are probably counting as two crits since you can get 3 crits of scorch.
