 URL : "https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc/issues/3678" TITLE : rank 7 traits ignored BODY : simulationcraft version 7.1.5 when you have 3 relics buffing the same trait and 4rank ups learned a total of 7ranks on a single trait simcraft is ignoring it and setting it as 0 ranks. on my warlock i have 7/7 on +crit% on immolate, i have 18% crit so +56% from trait should be 74% crit change on immolate however simcraft is setting it to 18%, it works on 6/6 giving me 66% crit chance probably because you could already get that far on the previous patch.
