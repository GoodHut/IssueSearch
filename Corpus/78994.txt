 URL : "https://github.com/TheSharks/WildBeast/issues/245" TITLE : request: prettify !prune BODY : nyan nyan! i tend to abuse the !prune command a lot. especially when the bot gives stupid !cat or !stroke results. i'd like to prettify the !prune command a little, as seen in another bots i tried about a year ago. when using !prune, the bot prunes the chat history, and leaves a :fire: for 3-5 seconds before that too goes poof. i'd like to see this being added in wildbeast.
