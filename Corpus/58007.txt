 URL : "https://github.com/headwirecom/aem-ide-tooling-4-intellij/issues/28" TITLE : revamp the aemdc panel BODY : improve the aemdc configuration dialog: - no configuration but lazybones configuration -> use 'aemdc -config' - move clone button to aemdc-file line, switch clone to pull when folder exists and is a git repo - have paths relative to project if it not more than 2 directories up - make paths unix style forward slash, absolute start with a forward slash - make sure clone / pull work fine if git is configured in intellij - if the dialog is cancelled then make sure the dialog is looking fine. - add help to the dialog input fields and buttons
