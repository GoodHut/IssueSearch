BODY : chatty version: 0.8.6 hoping that sometime in the future releases a dark mode or the ability to change tab, menu bar, and alternate pop out boxes ie emotes, automod, mod action logs colors to be something less harsh on the eyes. i have frequent migraines and to help change anything i can to dark colored backgrounds with soothing colored foreground fonts. the blinding colors at the top are just that, blindingly bright. i'm sure i'm not the only one who wishes for this type of ability. i would be very appreciative of this type of setting.
