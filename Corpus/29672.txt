 URL : "https://github.com/XinyunTang/4741-PROJ/issues/10" TITLE : midterm peer review BODY : this project involves using yelp data to predict restaurant inspection grades. specifically it looks at features of las vegas restaurants to predict the inspection grades given by the las vegas city department of health. strengths: - this is a great idea with real-world effects ex. as a restaurant owner, i can use this to better the quality of my restaurant and improve the chances of getting a good inspection grade . - nice use of scraping vs. yelp's potentially biased dataset. - also great use of sentiment analysis with vader; very interesting especially compared to just looking at features such as location, price, etc. improvements: - definitely increase the amount of data collected - your current dataset may be messy but it isn't very big considering what you're trying to predict. it might not be a bad idea, actually, just to use the api, if you think yelp is consistent in what reviews they filter. - i agree with your conclusion that you need more models and training/testing. this goes hand in hand with the previous point about collecting more data, but you should be able to use both unsupervised and supervised learning techniques to improve the accuracy of your model. - be more specific as to which features you're using and not using in your documentation. it would be helpful to people ex. restaurant owners, foodies if the model wasn't as black-boxed in terms of the features used. this is an excellent start! moving forward just scale up the data and use different algorithms to analyze it and it should get even better. nice work!
