 URL : "https://github.com/costinm/dmesh/issues/1" TITLE : multicast stops listening BODY : after some time, /proc/net/igmp6 shows the multicast listening on wlan0 is gone. restarting master restores it - workaround would be to periodically restart. need to investigate if the other uses of multicast are safe, and why it happens - on flounder only one of the mc listeners was gone. the ap interface was fine.
