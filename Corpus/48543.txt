 URL : "https://github.com/victims/victims-cve-db/issues/65" TITLE : semver ranges unclear BODY : hey, i was looking at your semver ranges and some of them were unclear, say unaffected: >=1.5.5,1.5 . does that mean v1.6.x is vulnerable? i'm guessing not, since its not referenced at all. my guess, in maven-talk, it would look like this 1.5.5, , meaning 1.6.x would also be included and unaffected.
