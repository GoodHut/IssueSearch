 URL : "https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/issues/110" TITLE : support for @ operator BODY : python 3.5 introduced the matrix multiplication operator @ which is roughly similar to np.dot it actually is np.matmul which behaves differently for arrays with more than two dimensions . it could make sense to support this operator in in nengo spa as the dot product is a common operation. so we could allow a @ b as alternative way of writing dot a, b . this would be equivalent to numpy for 1d vectors . however, a @ b looks more like the circular convolution symbol with the circle around the a and a b looks more like the dot of a dot product. thus, we might want to swap the meaning, i.e. a b is a dot product and a @ b is circular convolution? but that might be confusing, also we might want to consider whether an infix operator notation is more useful to have for dot products or circular convolutions in python < 3.5.
