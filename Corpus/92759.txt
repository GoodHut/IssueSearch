 URL : "https://github.com/davisking/dlib/issues/989" TITLE : 3d convolution and pooling BODY : i am currently looking for cnn training tools for windows with c++. dlib seems to be a good choice as the example clearly illustrate how resnet is implemented. however, i am looking for applications for 3d image segmentation which requires 3d pooling and convolution somehow it is called 4d convolution in this link https://sourceforge.net/p/dclib/discussion/442518/thread/62a130f4/ this function is supported in caffe2, tensorflow and pytorch. any plan to implement for a higher dimension cnn operations?
