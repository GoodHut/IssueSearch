 URL : "https://github.com/poldracklab/fmriprep/issues/578" TITLE : stochastic ica-aroma bug BODY : - https://circleci.com/gh/effigies/fmriprep/589 tests/containers/1 - https://circleci.com/gh/poldracklab/fmriprep/929 tests/containers/1 i suspect this is related to either the low resolution or the small number of time points. it's the ica-aroma interface failing to run, so the solution might need to be in nipype.
