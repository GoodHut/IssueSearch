 URL : "https://github.com/mobeets/nullSpaceControl/issues/382" TITLE : noise floor estimates BODY : estimating the noise floor for histogram error, mean error, and cov error for each session, errors are computed between the predicted and observed distributions, conditioned on 8 different cursor movement bins. the error for the session is the average of these 8 errors. for each session, i split the data into half, using 50% as observed and 50% as predicted. then averaged the errors across sessions. these are the values in the plot under “0.5”. i also split it into thirds, and used the first third as observed and the second third as predicted. this is the “0.33” value. etc... <img width= 348 alt= screen shot 2017-11-10 at 12 47 32 pm src= https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1677179/32671578-f3371c12-c615-11e7-9f9a-616408d6de39.png >
