 URL : "https://github.com/osm-fr/osmose-backend/issues/245" TITLE : ambiguous sport values BODY : there are a number of sport= values which should be discouraged. for example: football - should be refined to soccer, american/australian/canadian_football etc. and hockey should either be ice_hockey or field_hockey. it would be good if osmose highlighted these as values to fix under 3040, thanks.
