 URL : "https://github.com/ForkIssues/Tracker/issues/110" TITLE : prerelease fork 1.0.57 BODY : hi guys! during last 2 weeks i made global changes in fork and i'd like to kindly ask you to test if everything works properly in your environments. 🏇🏇🏇 the release contains major performance improvements for large repositories >25,000 commits . it affects: start up, refresh after being in background , stage/unstage, etc. for smaller repositories the improvements shouldn't be noticeable because everything is already fast. here's the change list: - ui is unresponsive for a couple seconds when the window becomes focused https://github.com/forkissues/tracker/issues/94 - replace spaces in new branch/tag names with hyphens https://github.com/forkissues/tracker/issues/106 - bug remotes don't appear on left panel https://github.com/forkissues/tracker/issues/105 - side-by-side view doesn't allow copying https://github.com/forkissues/tracker/issues/101 - bug commit button is disabled when merge with no file changed https://github.com/forkissues/tracker/issues/90 - better high sierra compatibility - use arrow symbols in behind/ahead branch labels - update pull and push windows to take branch upstream into account - bug file list view selection jumps to first item in list mode - bug merge view does not disappear after abort - increased max width of description column the update will be published publicly a bit later. link to download: https://git-fork.com/updates/files/fork-1.0.57.dmg. just run fork from dmg without installing if you want to keep both old and new versions. your feedback is greatly appreciated! p.s. have a good friday!
