 URL : "https://github.com/gausby/graphql_deux/issues/3" TITLE : state of this project? BODY : hi, i have just recently discovered this project. hehe, just after i finished by first version of a graphql-plug based on the excellent graphql-erlang project. i have introspection, basic error responses and the overall construct done. also i solved some of the more pesky problems, like encoding :null atoms for json or having non-utf8 strings in the graphql internal modules. see https://github.com/shopgun/graphql-erlang/pull/137 now before i go forth, write documentation and release a new hex package: maybe we can get together and move on from there? what is the state of this project? kind regards, lukas rieder
