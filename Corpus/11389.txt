 URL : "https://github.com/Marlin-Na/TnT/issues/1" TITLE : gsoc project log BODY : june 9th summary of current work at june 9, the package has a basic mechanism to construct jscascade and convert it to a tnt browser, rewritten with s4. in the last commit, i rethink about the structure of each track class and include implementation of certain types. in the current design, each track contains a slot of virtual class trackdata which has sub-classes like rangetrackdata , postrackdata , txdbtrackdata . each type of track will have methods to compile into javascript, with regard to the slot of trackdata and two other slots spec and display . i am currently designing the structure of browser class that holds all the tracks and methods to prepare the tracks before converting to javascript include tasks to summarize the genome, chromosome i.e. seqlevels and ranges from list of tracks . the most important task for now is to make the browser usable as soon as possible, expected before june 13 , then i will come back to tidy code and implement other types of track. tasks - implement gene track with txdbtrackdata class available - implement prototypes of tntboard and tntgenome classes and associated methods. then: - implement transcript track overall, i should quickly make the tnt browser usable, then find possible suggestions from toby and miguel.
