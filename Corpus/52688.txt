 URL : "https://github.com/schnaader/precomp-cpp/issues/66" TITLE : corrupted pcf behavior BODY : when pcf file is corrupted precomp does... nothing! 1 i change 1 byte in -cn pcf - recovered via -r file differs from original in 1 byte one case, may be others ; 2 if pcf is compressed -cb or -cl - i get error bzip2 or lzma stream corrupted, but precomp leaves tempfile and target partial file in directory. i think this behavior is extremely wrong. it must check consistency of pcf data and when error found - delete temp and target files maybe special switch to leave corrupted target needed .
