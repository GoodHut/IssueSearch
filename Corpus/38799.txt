 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim/issues/331" TITLE : randomly spawn drone BODY : what is the best pipeline to have the drone spawn in the air while the simulation is running? for example, i wonder if i can write a function in python that once the function is called, the drone will be reset in a random location in the air, armed and hovering. i'm aware that it may involve modifications on blueprints in unreal or even px4 firmware, but it would be great if i can have some instructions. this method would be very helpful for reinforcement learning that the drone can spawn at different locations after episodes end.
