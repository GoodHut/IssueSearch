 URL : "https://github.com/json-api/json-api/issues/1159" TITLE : self link inconsistency BODY : the spec says that a link can be either a string or an object http://jsonapi.org/format/ document-links . however the schema enforces that self links must be strings https://github.com/json-api/json-api/blob/509ee949c621cee5683c959d4268386e1a592b83/schema l158-l162 . it is also a bit odd that the properties and descriptions in definitions/links seems to be relationship-specific https://github.com/json-api/json-api/blob/509ee949c621cee5683c959d4268386e1a592b83/schema l154-l168 , but this definition is referenced from resource https://github.com/json-api/json-api/blob/509ee949c621cee5683c959d4268386e1a592b83/schema l144-l146 and top level https://github.com/json-api/json-api/blob/509ee949c621cee5683c959d4268386e1a592b83/schema l38-l43 link objects. i was wondering if the self links are an exception and must be strings intentionally, or is it a bug in the schema? if it's the latter i'd be happy to open a pr to fix the schema. sample use case: on a project i'm working on we prefer links as objects v.s. links. we have a convention to pass extra meta data for each link e.g. request header, http verb get/put/post and so on. however the schema validations fail if a resource self link is an object, even though there doesn't seem to be anything in the documentation that makes self links exceptional.
