 URL : "https://github.com/samrocketman/gitlab-mirrors/issues/99" TITLE : nested group support BODY : hi, now that we have nested group https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/group/subgroups/ in gitlab since v9 it would be very interesting to implement it in gitlab-mirrors. would be super useful, as we could mirror several git repositories of a unique project to a unique sub group in a base gitlab-mirrors group wow! cheers
