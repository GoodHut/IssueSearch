 URL : "https://github.com/quicklisp/quicklisp-projects/issues/1414" TITLE : please add de.setf.thrift BODY : apache thrift is an rpc protocol and serialization format used, among others, by facebook. this cl library is meant to work in tandem with files generated by the thrift code generator written in c++ from idl definition files. https://github.com/lisp/de.setf.thrift yes, this implementation is old, but we've opened a pr with a lot of work done to make this work on sbcl and against the current state of thrift. hopefully this is going to be merged soon and then - please add de.setf.thrift ;
