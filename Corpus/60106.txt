 URL : "https://github.com/svaarala/duktape/issues/1287" TITLE : whatwg url parsing api BODY : ecmascript built-ins provide some uri encoding/decoding support but it's not enough to actually work with uris. the whatwg url parsing api might be a useful counterpart to make uris easy to work with directly: https://url.spec.whatwg.org/. uris are commonly required in networking code so it might be nice to support them out of the box, and there's some internal shared code with the url encoding/decoding support though the rule tables might be different because the referenced url standards have different versions .
