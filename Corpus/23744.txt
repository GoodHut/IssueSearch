 URL : "https://github.com/sui77/rc-switch/issues/127" TITLE : reduction in range BODY : i have found that the range of detection code is lower when using rc switch on a esp8266 compared to the ebay relay modules. i have even taken the rf module from a working relay module and tried it on the esp9266 and rcswitch. the results is the range drops from 20m+ to no more than 3m. the tx is the same. the ebay key fobs. 24bit proto 1. anyone else seeing reduce range? any ideas? i have tried replacing the default antenna with only slight improvements and nothing like the relay module range
