 URL : "https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux/issues/2645" TITLE : router inside drawer BODY : version - react-native-router-flux@4.0.0-beta.23 - react-native v0.4.95 expected behaviour maybe i missed the point but shouldn't it be possible to use stacks/scenes insides other view of your application? in my case i need several scenes that represent a navigation tree inside a drawer. first scene = level 1, second scene = level 2 etc. i expected when a modal can hold a scene that a drawer could also hold a scene. actual behaviour using scenes in a drawer are ignored. wrapped in a stack, view or just a plain scene are not getting rendered. thanks in advance! <!-- love react-native-router-flux? please consider supporting our collective: ðŸ‘‰ https://opencollective.com/react-native-router-flux/donate -->
