BODY : i would like to resize the image only if it is larger than the size limits. this is my current code: $fopen = image::make $image, 'width' => 2400, 'height' => 1600 ->get $ext ; unfourtunately it upscales every image that is smaller in both dimensions. can i pass some option or do something else to disallow upscaling? i think i did this successfully before and i believe this was changed in version 0.1.6.
