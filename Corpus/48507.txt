 URL : "https://github.com/seatgeek/api-support/issues/40" TITLE : seatgeek in australia BODY : hello, we have several clients who use sro for their venue ticketing. we are currently looking into building a custom app using the sro api for one of our clients to improve the user experience in purchasing their tickets. i've had a bit of a look through seatgeek's platform pages but i'm a bit unsure how it would work with an australian venue. are there any australian venues on seatgeek? can the seatgeek platform be used to build a custom web app to integrate with the sro api?
