BODY : environment elixir version elixir -v : elixir 1.4.2 erlang version erl --version : erlang/otp 20 nodejs version node -v : v7.10.0 npm version npm -v : 4.5.0 operating system: arch linux have tried loading as far back as phoenix 1.1.6 and as far forward as 1.3.0 from <https://github.com/phoenixframework/archives> with the usual mix archive.install , and all are giving the same strange behaviour shown below. expected behavior from the example listed under mix phoenix.new , creating a project should be as simple as mix phoenix.new hello_world , with the usual options for removing ecto, choosing databases, and the like. actual behavior shell mix phoenix.new hello_world mix application name must start with a letter and have only lowercase letters, numbers and underscore, got: hello_world . the application name is inferred from the path, if you'd like to explicitly name the application then use the --app app option. mix phoenix.new hello_world --app hello_world mix application name must start with a letter and have only lowercase letters, numbers and underscore, got: hello_world obviously those errors don't make any sense, complaining about the format of the project name string when it clearly fits the requirements... have tried various names and they all return this error. after not having luck finding anything about this elsewhere online, i'm hoping someone here might be able to help.
