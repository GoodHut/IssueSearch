BODY : experiencing a failure when converting from a string value to a byte array. not sure if i am doing something wrong, or if perhaps the intent is to register an extension for this use case perhaps for an encoding selection? . or perhaps there is no array support? here's the implementation: // where type is a byte , and value is a string object converted = typeconverter.convert type, value ; // thrown illegalargumentexception: could not find type conversion for type class b value = 1111111 nice library btw. i have been building libraries for eons and for whatever reason, this one always ends up being a something that i shim up for now . thanks! monte
