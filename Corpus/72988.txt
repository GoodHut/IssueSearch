 URL : "https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/getting-started/issues/38" TITLE : client id secret removal BODY : in your tutorials, both importing and creating, you don't talk about removing the client_id from the swagger. do you want to keep that step or remove. as @zach-guilfoyle tutorial here: https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/getting-started/tree/master/toolkit/1b talks about removing the client id. even david shute's says remove client id. we need to be consistent whichever way we go forward.
