 URL : "https://github.com/hep-gc/Glintv2/issues/24" TITLE : keystone v3 support BODY : glint thus far has been built with openstack instances using v2 of keystone. all new releases will be using v3 which will require the use of the v3 python keystone client. mike has come up with a basic way to determine which version is needed using the auth url: try: authsplit = self.auth_url.split '/' if len authsplit -1 > 0: version = int float authsplit -1 1: else: version = int float authsplit -2 1: except: print problem determining version from auth_url i'll need to update the ansible script to include v3 of the client as well unless they are both in the same keystone package .
