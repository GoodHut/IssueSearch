change users should be included in changes. --- _comment from_: tardyp _date_: mar 16 2014 there might be at least 2 users for a change: the author of the patch
the committer of the patch aka the integrator or maintainer not even talking about tested-by, acked-by, etc linux people are using. all those people deserve to be in the blame list, and have a nice dashboard with all builds for patches they are working on. ---
_comment from_: dustin _date_: feb 07 2015 correct, so in the data api, a change should have a list of users, rather than a single user.
