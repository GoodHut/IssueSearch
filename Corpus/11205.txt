 URL : "https://github.com/creativecommons/commoners/issues/108" TITLE : fix the top menu BODY : this is not for g but edgardo. the menu should display something different as far we are trying not to lead the visitor to sign up as member but to _get involved_ with cc. that menu remains from early versions on the website. we should change that towards something heading the visitor to _know more_ or get involved. ps: for some reason i can't assign ed to this.
