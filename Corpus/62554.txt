 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/mobile-center-cli/issues/273" TITLE : confusing package names BODY : if you install 'mobile-center' with npm you get an outdated version of the cli available on the command line 0.9.1 i believe and no amount of npm updating mobile-center will give you the latest version. if you install 'mobile-center-cli you get the latest. this is really confusing.
