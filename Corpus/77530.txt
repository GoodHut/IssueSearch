 URL : "https://github.com/LyzandeR/tableHTML/issues/10" TITLE : new tablehtml attributes BODY : i think we would benefit from including additional attributes to the tablehtml object. - number of columns - number of rows - data types for columns - flag if rownames, rowgroups, and second headers are present as an alternative the whole original table could be one of the attributes e.g. data , but it might not be practical with big tables.
