 URL : "https://github.com/pygeo/rt1/issues/14" TITLE : correct brdf normalization BODY : fix standard brdf normalizations such that they are consistent for the isotropic case, i.e. - isotropic := normbrdf / pi - henyeygreenstein t=0 = isotropic = normbrdf /pi - currently we have: henyeygreenstein t=0 = n / 4pi - cosinelobe i=0 = isotropic = normbrdf/pi - currently we have: cosinelobe i=0 =normbrdf -> adapt tests to fit to the new normalizations
