 URL : "https://github.com/mit-crpg/openmc-workshop/issues/1" TITLE : statepoint in part 3 BODY : there seems to be a problem with the statepoint file in the part 3 https://github.com/mit-crpg/openmc-workshop/blob/master/part3/part3-solutions.ipynb ipython notebook. i'm getting an error and seeing a weird traceback when running cell 2 : in the notebook, sp = openmc.statepoint 'statepoint.100.h5' ; see attached. i get pretty much the same error trying to load the statepoint outside of the notebook, too. loading statepoint.50.h5 generated in part 2 works just fine, which leads me to believe that the statepoint.100.h5 was either corrupted or made with an old version of hdf5. cell2error.txt https://github.com/mit-crpg/openmc-workshop/files/775834/cell2error.txt
