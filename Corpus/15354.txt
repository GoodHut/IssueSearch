 URL : "https://github.com/f4exb/sdrangel/issues/77" TITLE : demod data offset BODY : i have recorded a signal from the udp source and found that for a very low signal i can see a negative offset to the data. it seems to be about 0x180 down, looking at the numbers in the file. this offset is even noticeable in larger waveforms. the signal should ride the zero line evenly plus and minus. i think it may be causing problems with some signal processing downstream as for a pure frequency the zero crossings aren't even. do you know where this offset comes from? for audio it has no effect.
