 URL : "https://github.com/aequasi/discord-analytics-bot/issues/3" TITLE : no data in analytics BODY : hello, i invited the bot to my server and registered the bot with /set-token . the bot told me that it got my token and deleted my message accordingly. however, a day later, i look in analytics but there is still absolutely nothing there, despite activity in the server. what gives? further documentation on proper usage would be appreciated. thanks in advance.
