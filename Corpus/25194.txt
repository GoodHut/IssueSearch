 URL : "https://github.com/mikakev1/MildInstaller/issues/8" TITLE : viewing error logs BODY : i've been working to get cemu running, and have hit a wall with what to try next. i've been using the instructions listed in issue 7 as a reference, since i too have a polaris card radeon pro 570 . i was able to get cemu running and can get to the botw main menu, but only when i have no existing shader cache present. if i copy in a shader cache, or leave the one that gets created during a successful start, it usually starts to compile and then crashes. i'm also not seeing the distorted graphics that stajin was showing in his screenshots. i'm hoping to look at some kind of log or tee something off to a file to figure out what to try and fix, but i haven't been able to figure out where any logs would be, aside from the cemu directory log.txt. any info you can provide would be a huge help. thanks!
