 URL : "https://github.com/railsbridge/bridge_troll/issues/571" TITLE : cancel upcoming event? BODY : hi there! i need to cancel an upcoming event for the denver railsbridge chapter https://www.bridgetroll.org/events/368 and can't seem to find a way to do this in the organizer console or after poking around in the code. we've emailed all of the students/tas already but i'm nervous that someone might not see the email and will show up day-of to an empty room! do you have any recommendations for us as to how to proceed? apologies if i am completely missing the functionality somewhere -- blame it on thanksgiving brain fog! cheers!
