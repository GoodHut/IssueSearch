 URL : "https://github.com/janko-m/vim-test/issues/166" TITLE : too early compiler choice BODY : with the below configuration vim-test let test strategy = 'dispatch' vim-dispatch let g:dispatch_compilers = {} let g:dispatch_compilers.phpunit = 'phpunit2' when i run, for example, :testnearest , then :dispatch gets ./vendor/bin/phpunit into the first argument so phpunit compiler is ignored. although i found a workaround by set this argument manually let test php phpunit executable = 'phpunit' i think that test php phpunit executable first should get the proper value from the compiler definition if that exist and if it make sense. it seems that searching the executable should be the responsibility of a particular _compiler_. maybe this issue is more generic - not specific for phpunit and independent of vim-dispatch .
