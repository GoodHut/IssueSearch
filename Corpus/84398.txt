 URL : "https://github.com/marcbachmann/node-html-pdf/issues/273" TITLE : css variables not working BODY : i am generating several pdfs, all of them have two css one for setting variables and the last one for normal styling. to better create the pdfs i am embedding the css directly inside the html tag, while margins and font-size etc affect the document, css variables do not. i see from that that css variables are not supported, am i doing something wrong, or am i right to assume they are not working.
