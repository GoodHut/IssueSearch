 URL : "https://github.com/Blueshoe/djangocms-layouter/issues/17" TITLE : different grid size BODY : currently the layouter only works for the 12-column bootstrap grid. however it is possible to extend the bootstrap grid to other grid sizes e.g. 24-column grid . maybe we could find a more simple possibility for developers to adapt this parameter to their projects without needing to override all templates.
