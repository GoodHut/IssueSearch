 URL : "https://github.com/qdev-dk/qdev-wrappers/issues/29" TITLE : extension to examples BODY : would be nice to have a few more example scripts and maybe also a readme or similar for the workflow ie you should install xyz, make a copy of the templates folder in m location, make l changes and then run n script to get started measuring with explanation of how it all works etc. examples which would be nice: - an extension to the vna example to flesh out how spectroscopy mode works with all the latest bells and whistles - an example of using some of the analysis and plotting functions when they have been cleaned up a bit - some more examples of how the wrappers facilitate multi qubit measurement eg uploading to the awg, setting things on alazar and microwave source concepts.
