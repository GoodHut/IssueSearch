 URL : "https://github.com/openscope/openscope/issues/5" TITLE : airport layout overlay BODY : add the ability to somehow show all runways/taxiways/buildings as an svg overlay on top of the airport. in the below reference, airport diagram pdf's were used, and the extra markings removed in order to yield the image to be used. this technique may be the most obvious, but isn't the most practical, as it is very labor intensive. may want to consider further research into how this might be achieved before taking the time to do this for all airports. some success was had with zlsa/atc 178.
