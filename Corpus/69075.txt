 URL : "https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/issues/929" TITLE : status of rate limiting BODY : what is the current status of the rate limiting implementation? the manual says the ratelimit property is not used, but i noticed the initrestratelimiter function and the token bucket + throttle.js... and it seems that if you set enableratelimit, fetch2 will wait on throttle also i believe the rate limit for gemini is incorrect. it's at 1500, but should probably be 1000. the actual limit is 2 per second but recommended is 1 per second see here https://docs.gemini.com/rest-api/ rate-limits
