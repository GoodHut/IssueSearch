 URL : "https://github.com/mrmin123/kcauto-kai/issues/39" TITLE : could not start sortie. BODY : when you turn lbas on, active or defensive mode, kc-kai is expecting to see the sortie button with the green lbas bar for example: ! https://i.imgur.com/cwrb4vm.png but when you want to just turn lbas on defensive there is no sortie button with the green lbas bar. for example, sortie with 3 lbas on defensive mode ! kcecban https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20022859/33793035-8f373430-dc64-11e7-8e22-c20ebe6aba1a.png a solution to this problem would be to check if the user as turned on lbas but has selected no nodes, inferring that the lbas's are on defensive mode, then just finding the red sortie bar when at the sortie screen.
