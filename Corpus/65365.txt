 URL : "https://github.com/wix/angular-tree-control/issues/281" TITLE : inline editing of nodes BODY : is there a way in the directive to allow for nodes to become editable inline either via a button or clicking on the node itself? the expected behavior would be a user clicks on the node text and it turns into an input box. when the user clicks out of the input box, the node text is updated with the user's value. thank you!
