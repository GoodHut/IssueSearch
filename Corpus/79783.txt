 URL : "https://github.com/wonday/react-native-pdf/issues/60" TITLE : strange behaviors in ios BODY : i have some issues that are just happening in ios. android works just fine. 1. when zooming, the view resets to the center. this means that if i move around the pdf and then try to zoom in or out, i get back to the center every time. 2. the speed when panning is super slow. 3. when zooming out until you can see the pdf, it does some weird wiggles, like moving up and down. thanks!
