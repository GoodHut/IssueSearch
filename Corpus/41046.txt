 URL : "https://github.com/opencit/opencit/issues/88" TITLE : why install as root? BODY : not a bug, but a strong suggestion. this is a massive installation script and procedure. it's worrying to run it as root, not knowing what the installer is overwriting. 1. if it's really overwriting system files, this should be documented. it could be affecting other applications. 2. if it's self contained, not writing in other directories, please fix it so that it can be installed as a non-privileged user. the only reason i can think of for needing root is to open /dev/tpm0. this can easily be fixed by chmod 666 /dev/tpm0, which is far safer than running the entire install process and application s as root.
