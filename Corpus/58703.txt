 URL : "https://github.com/wp-sync-db/wp-sync-db-cli/issues/10" TITLE : status of this project BODY : hey, i'm just wondering what the status of this project is. is this still a functioning wp-cli plugin? i ask because i don't see it in the wp-cli package repository, and there isn't much documentation here about how to install it. let me know how to install it if so, otherwise i may fork and keep working on it. thanks!
