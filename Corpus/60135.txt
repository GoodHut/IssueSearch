 URL : "https://github.com/philsinatra/htmlNestedCommentsVSCode/issues/4" TITLE : why is not js support? BODY : it's basic, and it steals the shortcut from the working one.... could not be hard as it's just toggle //, however if you wanna stay systematic then change on js files // to ~~ too, would be nice.... if you support vue, i really don't understand how on earth leave out js extension..... : appreciate your work. thanx, ben
