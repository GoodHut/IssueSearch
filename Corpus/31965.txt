 URL : "https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/961" TITLE : texture with frames BODY : hi. in our project we use rectangles as placeholders in fla files . we set alpha 0 to their fill. after converting to textures such a rectangle becomes a 3x3 with frame 1x1. all was good in starling 1.6. recentlty we migrated to starling 2. all placeholders become 3 times wider and higher. i think there is a bug in texture.as in setupvertexpositions . if frame srectangle.setto -frame.x, -frame.y, width, height ; else srectangle.setto 0, 0, width, height ; looks like it should be line 609 if frame srectangle.setto -frame.x, -frame.y, frame.width, frame.height ; else srectangle.setto 0, 0, width, height ; also i'm not sure about -frame.x, -frame.y . in our case frame.x == 0 so it works. maybe here is a good place to use texture's public function get framewidth ?
