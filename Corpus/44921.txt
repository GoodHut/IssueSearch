 URL : "https://github.com/topheman/gopher-ball/issues/2" TITLE : generate static build BODY : this project is using the go bindings for sdl2 https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2 . so i have the shared libraries installed on my computer via homebrew, you would have done it via apt-get on linux and shared dll on windows . if i want to generate a binary to be distributed to people without asking them to install the sdl2 libraries via a package manager, i need to make a static build shipping with those libraries. i've added the following comments for cgo in my main.go https://github.com/topheman/gopher-ball/blob/master/main.go : go // cgo windows ldflags: -lsdl2 -lsdl2_image -lsdl2_ttf // cgo linux freebsd darwin pkg-config: sdl2 // cgo linux freebsd darwin ldflags: -lsdl2_image -lsdl2_ttf // include <sdl_wrapper.h> import c sdl_wrapper.h : c if defined __win32 include <sdl2/sdl.h> include <sdl2/sdl_image.h> include <sdl2/sdl_ttf.h> include <stdlib.h> else include <sdl.h> include <sdl_image.h> include <sdl_ttf.h> endif if !defined sdl_window_allow_highdpi define sdl_window_allow_highdpi 0x00002000 endif i'm using a makefile https://github.com/topheman/gopher-ball/blob/master/makefile for the build. after running : cgo_enabled=0 goos=darwin goarch=amd64 go build -o gopher-ball-darwin-amd64.app . , i get the following error: github.com/veandco/go-sdl2/sdl ../../veandco/go-sdl2/sdl/yuv_sw_c.go:17: undefined: surface ../../veandco/go-sdl2/sdl/yuv_sw_c.go:18: undefined: surface make: darwin error 2
