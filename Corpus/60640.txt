 URL : "https://github.com/elastic/rally/issues/292" TITLE : add a simple track mode BODY : at the moment, tracks always need to reside in rally's directory tree and it also needs to be managed by git. however, sometimes a user may just wants to run a very simple one-off benchmark and then all this complexity is not needed. for these cases we could allow the user to provide an arbitrary directory on the machine where a custom track resides. it can also contain optional data files and python extensions custom runners and parameter sources . however, it does not need to be managed by git. in the future, this simple mode will have one drawback though: once we distribute the load test driver see 257 , the simple mode can only be used if the user does want to run a distributed benchmark.
