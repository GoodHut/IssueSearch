 URL : "https://github.com/dariusk/wordfilter/issues/36" TITLE : new python release BODY : hi @fitnr, the latest release on pypi https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wordfilter and the one you get from pip install wordfilter is 0.2.5. the python source hasn't changed, but badwords.json has and it's at 0.2.6. please could you make a new python release? i think it probably makes sense to merge your setup.py https://github.com/fitnr/wordfilter/blob/master/setup.py into this repo too. thanks!
