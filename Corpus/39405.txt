 URL : "https://github.com/VCVRack/Fundamental/issues/9" TITLE : seq3 with adsr issue BODY : it looks to me like seq-3 is having problems driving the adsr, at least on the windows version. i think the gate isn't long enough. sadly the seq3 gate out into the trigger in also doesn't do anything. i've included a screenshot showing 2 duplicated adsrs operating via gates from seq3 and the midi interface. ! seq3-adsr-issue https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32727478/31616993-35a13ba0-b25c-11e7-9af2-6f0a794ac8fb.png oh i chopped off the top of the window the screenshot is from the 0.4.0 windows binary package.
