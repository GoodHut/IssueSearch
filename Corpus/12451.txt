 URL : "https://github.com/starekrow/lockbox/issues/18" TITLE : php version bump BODY : i see you bumped the version to php 7 because of phpunit. i quick tested and it looks like i can get phpunit 4.x running with 2 minor changes to the tests which supports php 5.5 . although, i still like the idea of supporting 7+ or 5.6+ because of php security patching support, but i also think the version shouldn't be bumped just because of the testing framework. php support: http://php.net/supported-versions.php see https://github.com/kjljon/lockbox/commit/d8be02677d6d763619a52aa00a9fa09edb9e3d53 for 5.5+ fix. @starekrow what are your thoughts? i can send a pr for the commit listed above if you still want to support php 5.5+
