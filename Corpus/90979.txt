 URL : "https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim/issues/1698" TITLE : support for join lines :j BODY : vi has command :j for joining current line with next one where all leading whitespaces are eliminated . it would be nice to have it in this plugin. i am using this command very often when i am using vim. other vim-emulators like vim-mode in qtcreator or vimstyle alternative plugin support the command. additionally the command could accept integer parameter which tells how many next lines should be joined.
