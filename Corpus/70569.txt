 URL : "https://github.com/warfare-plugins/social-warfare/issues/429" TITLE : widget form php notices BODY : the foreach loop going through the available networks on the widgets page https://github.com/warfare-plugins/social-warfare/blob/master/functions/widgets/widgets.php l100 is throwing some php notices: undefined index: facebook | 2 | local.content.dev/plugins/social-warfare/functions/widgets/widgets.php:100 if the line is changed to check if the key is set and that it exists, the notices are resolved for me: if isset $options $key && $options $key { note: i am testing this locally and have very minimal settings configured, so it may be that some configuration is missing, but the notices relate to the three networks i have selected to show, so i think it's as configured as it needs to be for this form.
