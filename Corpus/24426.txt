 URL : "https://github.com/fabioricali/incache/issues/1" TITLE : store data in file BODY : if node process will be restarted we lost all data stored in cache. this is not a problem in most of condition but there are few scenarios where this could be a problem, for example if you store information about sessions with short time expiration during a restart you probably get unverified session. is it possible to add an option that store data in a file ?
