 URL : "https://github.com/driftyco/cordova-plugin-ios-keychain/issues/18" TITLE : ios keychain sharing BODY : hello developers! thank you very much for implementing this plugin. it is very easy to use and has a clean, simple implementation. however, my team is hoping to use this plugin in order to access a shared keychain across multiple apps for our company, and are struggling to come up with a solution. we have been unable to find a way to specify an accessgroup within your plugin, even after modification of the .m files within src/ios. on two separate apps, we have enabled keychain sharing through xcode, given them both the same keychain group name within their .entitlements files, and also enabled icloud for good measure through our apple developer site. they both use the same bundle seed as well. would you be able to shed any light on how we might implement keychain sharing using your plugin? any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
