 URL : "https://github.com/fairf4x/dso_ros/issues/2" TITLE : crashes on initialization BODY : so far i have been able to track two different types of crash : 1. problem with reseting the fullsystem pointer resulting in: double free or corruption !prev this might be related because this again results in creating new instance of fullsystem but the trace actually points to the _destructor_ of fullsystem class. 2. eigen related assertion that points here http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox-devel/group__topicunalignedarrayassert.html this happens when new instance of fullsystem class is allocated and therefore an instance of calibhessian structure is created as a private variable. gdb backtraces are attached. btw: ros launchfiles can be modified to run gdb http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/tutorials/roslaunch%20nodes%20in%20valgrind%20or%20gdb . errors_dso.txt https://github.com/fairf4x/dso_ros/files/991524/errors_dso.txt
