 URL : "https://github.com/OpenDataServices/flatten-tool/issues/141" TITLE : roll up with objects BODY : using the schema and command in this gist https://gist.github.com/timgdavies/addf0e94528d42391d12a614808dd120 i get the error: > userwarning: share in rollup but not in schema however, share is present in the schema, but as an object, rather than a string. my target behaviour in this case would be to rollup each of the properties of share. is this feasible? i can see that rollups should never target an array, but i suspect allowing them to target an object is useful.
