 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/malmo/issues/588" TITLE : getting block entity data BODY : is it possible to enhance observationfromrayimplementation.buildmouseoverdata to retrieve addtional block entity data? for example signs have four lines of text text1, text2, text3, text4 as extra data. the agent could then read the sign by using observationfromray and then prop_text1 etc. next to a door, to see whether it is his house for example. current output i have is: { lineofsight :{ hittype : block , x :220.63356369148156, y :86.60169553502067, z :1552.125, type : wall_sign , prop_facing : south , inrange :true, distance :1.6947537660598755}} from what i can see with my limited resources it should be doable to implement, on the other hand this would certainly involve some work to get the extra data of all available special blocks. i try it with some other block to assume it is the sign with his name . so this is more like a feature request than an urgent problem. does s.o. see a better wordaround here for the moment? or do i miss sth completly, as it is already possbile what i request? thanks!
