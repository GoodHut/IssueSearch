 URL : "https://github.com/dgreenhalgh/simple-item-decoration/issues/29" TITLE : spansize for gridview BODY : hi. i've got a gridlayoutmanager with 2 columns, but i'm using a header as the object inside the adapter. so i'm implementing setspansizelookup on the layout manager and i'm setting the first item to have spansize 2, the rest have 1. the problem is that the vertical lines don't show up anymore and under the header on it's right ride, below it, there's a divider. so the code which draws the lines goes crazy a bit : maybe you could fix it. i'll try to do it locally, but i don't have time to push to you repo. :
