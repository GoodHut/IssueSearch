 URL : "https://github.com/JuliaMatrices/ToeplitzMatrices.jl/issues/25" TITLE : load error on nightly BODY : this is just a small head's up that there is a load error on nightly julia builds. see, for example, https://travis-ci.org/mikaelslevinsky/fasttransforms.jl/jobs/247697067. i think it's because fftw and abstractffts are being moved out of base? probably this means updating fasttransforms too!
