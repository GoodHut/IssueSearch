 URL : "https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/issues/723" TITLE : output junit format BODY : it would be very helpful if cucumberjs supported output format of junit xml. this is a fairly standard output format for test packages but currently the best we can do is to output as json and convert the json to junit after the fact. the packages that allege to support this operation don't work well or at all at least in my experience , so it would be great if cucumberjs were updated to produce this output like the other test packages do.
