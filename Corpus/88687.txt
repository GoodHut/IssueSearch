 URL : "https://github.com/Lone-Coder/letsencrypt-win-simple/issues/621" TITLE : official v1.9.7.0 release BODY : just want to make sure of a couple of things before relying on 1.9.7. i noticed the download no longer includes the x32 and x64 folders with the ssl libraries; is this because it is now using bouncy castle for those calls? also, the download no longer includes acmesharp.dll ... does this now need to be installed separately?
