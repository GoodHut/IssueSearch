 URL : "https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8-ux/issues/499" TITLE : patternfly-ng clean up BODY : would like to clean up the patternfly-ng library prior to creating our first npm package, including: - rename remaining-chars component to remaining-chars-count to match apf. - rename pipes directory to search-highlight since it contains its own search-highlight module. - rename filtersmodule module to match other filter type prefixes. - rename aciotnsconfig and viewsconfig to match action and view types.
