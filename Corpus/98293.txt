 URL : "https://github.com/hotosm/oam-browser/issues/253" TITLE : initial api call over 10mb BODY : our initial api call for loading the browser is over 10mb. this is quite slow in a low bandwidth environment. but also you see the difference between the latest imagery loading in the sidebar smaller call, 22kb and the main call for the map. idea for improving this: move to a filtered api call on load. load with the filter in place for high resolution and within the last month.
