 URL : "https://github.com/rycoll/Tomb-Rater/issues/3" TITLE : special event ui BODY : special events are going to be broken up a little more than in the last version. there will be multiple chunks of text, which you navigate through like a conversation. what is the best way to implement this - should we allow multiple possible paths through a conversation, or is all the decision making right at the end? what should the ui look like?
