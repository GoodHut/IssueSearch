 URL : "https://github.com/fortwaynelinux/fortwaynelinux.org/issues/32" TITLE : footer svg icon tweaks BODY : the email icon is a departure from the rest, with its dark-on-light color scheme. replace in fwlug_style.scss with a light-on-dark icon. the meetup icon's pseudo-glossy effect is on a different slope than the rest of the icons. fix this and move its definition to fwlug_style.scss. to do this properly will require doing a git rebase on the master branch.
