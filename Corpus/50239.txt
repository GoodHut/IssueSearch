BODY : according to the atmega328 pinout https://camo.githubusercontent.com/0a921969a9bbbd74b6d85ffe6cd10f0a5963987a/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f624f4a504e35682e6a7067 , pc2 is equal to a2 - or to put it another way, arduino pin 16. however, according to the arduino ide, pc2 is equal to 2: void setup { serial.begin 115200 ; serial.println pc2 ; } > 2 this kind of elementary mistake makes it very difficult to get anything done.
