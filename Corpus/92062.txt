 URL : "https://github.com/MoarCatz/nmaps-telegram/issues/10" TITLE : usernames handling issues BODY : not everyone in telegram has a nickname. this is a problem for our bot since it stores usernames instead of ids. if it tries to retrieve the username which doesn't exist, it gets an exception. we should change our user interaction concept and try to get username where appropriate. if it doesn't exist, take his first/last/both names also take his id in order to create a link .
