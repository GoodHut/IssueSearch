 URL : "https://github.com/ngrx/effects/issues/146" TITLE : better error reporting BODY : basically restating what's here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39777220/cannot-read-property-type-of-undefined-ngrx . the error thrown looks like > uncaught typeerror: cannot read property 'call' of undefined and the stack trace leads you to believe the error is in the reducer when in fact it occurs when the effect doesn't return a valid action. this leads to a lot of confusion when trying to track down the source of the problem.
