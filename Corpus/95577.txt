 URL : "https://github.com/Seneral/TC2-Node-Painter-Beta/issues/30" TITLE : define terms in a glossary BODY : it would be helpful to define terms used in the docs. for example a glossary for terms like: nodepainter script - the script used to map canvas data to a tc2 node. it is possible to map the canvas data to multiple nodes using node targets. for example when you want to paint biomes, you can attach the script to a gameobject outside of the tc2 node hierarchy and specify multiple nodes for mapping. biome - a biome is a grouping of flora and fauna for a habitat like a forest, tundra, or desert. with node painter, you can group splat, trees, grass, etc into a biome using a multi channel canvas and the node targets setting. each color in a multi channel canvas can represent a biome for your terrain. see the biomepainting example. canvas - the buffer used for painting data that is mapped to one or multiple tc2 nodes. data in a canvas can be used to paint height, textures or masks.
