 URL : "https://github.com/MinVR/MinVR/issues/159" TITLE : win dll file locations BODY : for example, the openvr minvr plugin needs to have access to the openvr dll file. many people apparently do not have this installed system-wide, so need the dll copied into the directory where the executable will reside. am i misunderstanding this? propose that each plugin copy the dlls it needs into somewhere in the install tree. something like $install/share/dlls or something, so a build script can copy stuff from there. or someone else have something to propose?
