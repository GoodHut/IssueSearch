 URL : "https://github.com/eez-open/psu-firmware/issues/157" TITLE : compile issue in 1.0.1? BODY : i had to comment out the following line in ethernet.cpp in the 1.01 and master builds to get the project to compile, ethernet.setdhcptimeout ethernet_dhcp_timeout 1000ul ; leaving it in yields the following compile error: sketch/ethernet.cpp: in function 'void eez::psu::ethernet::init ': ethernet.cpp:146: error: 'class ethernetclass' has no member named 'setdhcptimeout' ethernet.setdhcptimeout ethernet_dhcp_timeout 1000ul ; ^ exit status 1 'class ethernetclass' has no member named 'setdhcptimeout' i've updated all the ide libraries, but no help. is this a bug or did i misconfigure something? thanks art
