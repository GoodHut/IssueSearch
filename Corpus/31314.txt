 URL : "https://github.com/whir1/serilog-sinks-graylog/issues/6" TITLE : send messages async BODY : hi there, i think it would be great to have a possibility to send messages async. maybe do it configurable. because right now you are sending the message inside a task , but you are waiting on it to finish. which practically makes it sync. serilog.sinks.graylog/transport/udp/udptransportclient.cs public void send byte payload { task resulttask = task.run => { using var udpclient = new udpclient { udpclient.sendasync payload, payload.length, _target ; } } ; resulttask.wait ; } i would love to contribute to it. maybe we could remove the wait or not according to configuration by user thanks!
