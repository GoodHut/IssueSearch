 URL : "https://github.com/sabnzbd/sabnzbd/issues/818" TITLE : minimum free space BODY : would it be possible to have minimum free space to auto pause if there is not enough space for the current download? then maybe check any others in the download queue, and if there is enough space run those downloads. for example, say you have available by disk space or disk quotas 7gb free in your download path, and in your queue you have 3 jobs. first one is 1.4gb, and the second one is 8gb, and the last one is 4gb. so the process would check the first item and see if enough space, yes there is, so it would process that one. then it would check the second item, and because that would not fit, then it would skip that item. then again, it would move onto the next job, and because there is enough space it would process that one. it would then pause the downloads until enough space becomes available. presuming that there was 3 in the queue, or else it would look at all the items in the queue anyways, just an idea - thanks for all the work so far.....
