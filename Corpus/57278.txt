 URL : "https://github.com/Looking4Group/L4G_Core/issues/3559" TITLE : pristine black diamond BODY : i don't have proof to validate this ticket but it seems the drop rate for the pristine black diamond is very very low or bugged. can someone confirm this? i have run multiple runs through scholo, dm & strath. still have not seen one and have spoken to other paladins & warlocks trying to get the epic mount and they have also been unsuccessful. thank you for feedback!
