 URL : "https://github.com/raix/push/issues/315" TITLE : push is missing. BODY : i have this code that is working properly at phonegap-plugin-push@1.8.2 push.push.setapplicationiconbadgenumber => { console.log 'push.setbadge: ', activitybadgecount ; }, e => { console.log 'push.setapplicationiconbadgenumber: error', e.message ; }, activitybadgecount ; recently i updated to phonegap-plugin-push@2.0.0 and logged push , it does not contain push.push anymore, thus resulting to an error : ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30395322/30199365-047e54ce-94a5-11e7-870c-df1011489188.png i have tried to check the repository the only difference i saw is that phonegap implemented 'use strict' does this affect raix thus removing the push function?
