 URL : "https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-state-tree/issues/141" TITLE : difficulty to debug app. BODY : when using mobx state tree all of app's function calls are wrapped into vm call with a following content: js function f / / { return function addmodules { return f.apply this, arguments } } the name of the function in the call stack is correct, but the content is the one above. this makes it quite difficult to debug the code. is this a fault of my bundler? fusebox . are you experiencing the same on webpack?
