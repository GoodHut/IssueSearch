 URL : "https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/1135" TITLE : keychain pass phrase BODY : the keychain https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/1133 requires a pass phrase to protect the private keys at rest. currently it is hardcoded https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/1133/files diff-01322901018c53a7f0721b555a4fb703r16 , which is not secure . i suggest we add the --pass ... option to ipfs . if the 'pass' option is not specified, then all access to the keychain should return the error 'access to the keychain is not allowed, please use --pass'. this is something like pubsub when --enable-pubsub-experiment is not specified.
