 URL : "https://github.com/aesy/chrome-reddit-comment-highlights/issues/11" TITLE : i cannot get this to work. BODY : i am using chrome, currently updated; windows 10 64-bit; my other extensions are ublock, which i've tried toggling on or off or even disabling; reddit enhancement suite, which i've tried disabling; and hoverzoom, which i've also tried toggling; and, autoreplay for youtube. quite simply, i don't see new comments highlighted at all. attached is a screenshot of a thread from /r/pathfinder_rpg which clearly has an unread comment but none of the comments displayed are highlighted. you'll just have to take my word for it that i've tried this on multiple threads, and there exists the same problem. i'm not using night mode or anything like that. what am i doing wrong? i installed to chrome via the chrome web store. ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32933555/31775318-df41f3e0-b4ad-11e7-8dff-5f90709a4cde.png
