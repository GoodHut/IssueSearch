 URL : "https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-net/issues/484" TITLE : incorrect unit test BODY : hi all, i've noticed that the unit test at https://github.com/azure/azure-storage-net/blob/master/test/classlibrarycommon/blob/cloudblobtest.cs l314 is incorrect. it assumes that the http headers used for meta properties such as x-ms-meta-<name> are case sensitive. according to http://www.w3.org/protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec4.html sec4.2, however, http headers are case insensitive. can you fix this? thanks!
