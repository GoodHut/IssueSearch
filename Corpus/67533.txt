 URL : "https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-PHP-SDK/issues/762" TITLE : print/debug sdk objects BODY : perhaps i missed something in the documentation somewhere. or maybe it's just a php thing. but when trying to debug responses from api calls, the objects seem almost impossible to view any info. example: i just created a payment $payment->create $apicontext ; . after executing i would like to seem some details on the object. with xdebug on it looks like this: ! image https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6412919/21904451/8ad0e752-d8b8-11e6-9980-77122451bf80.png to get something like the auth_id i must do : $auth_id = $payment->gettransactions 0 ->getrelatedresources 0 ->getauthorization ->getid ; . that seems extremely unreasonable to chain through so many object's methods to extract info... and i would have to do it for all properties i need. is there no way to convert the $payment response to an array or something so i can access things a little easier? at the very least a way to pretty print the object so i don't have to hunt as much to get some info?
