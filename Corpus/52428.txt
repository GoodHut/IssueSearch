 URL : "https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_ci/issues/126" TITLE : cmake project support? BODY : just got a question if industrial_ci supports cmake , non catkin package i assume something still related to ros. e.g. ros qtcreator plugin http://www.ros.org/news/2016/07/qt-creator-ide-plug-in-for-ros.html from @levi-armstrong. i wouldn't say we would plan to support cmake project, at least for now, given industrial_ci is currently tied to catkin_tools . but i'll leave this open for discussion.
