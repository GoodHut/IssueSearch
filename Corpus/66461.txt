 URL : "https://github.com/DexterInd/BrickPi3/issues/38" TITLE : motor status indication BODY : while working on ev3dev support for brickpi3, i found a missing feature that is present on other similar devices. there is not any feedback from the motors other than the position. other useful feedback would include: running - the motor is powered stalled - the motor is powered, but not rotating speed - the current speed of the motor overloaded - when running with the speed pid, the motor is not able to reach the target speed holding - when running to a position, indicates that the position has been reached and the position pid is holding the motor at the desired position see https://github.com/ev3dev/ev3dev/issues/282 issue-59308478 for a table with a comparison of other devices.
