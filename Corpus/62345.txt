 URL : "https://github.com/psfinaki/ChordinaryWorld/issues/55" TITLE : classify error messages BODY : problem currently all the error messages belong to the same du. however, some of them can be returned only with success e.g. unknowndatabaseerror and others only with failure . that leads to the code like this: fsharp match result with | success _, messages -> let handlemessage = function | unknowndatabaseerror -> something bad happened in database |> logsongerror song | unknownflavours _ | chordsnotfound | emptyinput -> failwith this must not happen here ... which is obviously a bad practice. error messages should be split to different types.
