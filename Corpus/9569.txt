 URL : "https://github.com/night/BetterTTV/issues/2284" TITLE : 2 beta v7 issues BODY : first, scrolling up in beta doesn't pause the chat. when i place the mouse over the chat and mousewheel up the chat doesn't pause, only when i click on the chat while it is scrolled up quickly will the more messages below shows. this is very hard to do in fast moving chats. second, when using tab complete, emote codes are mixed into the selection of names instead of coming after all relevant usernames are tabbed through
