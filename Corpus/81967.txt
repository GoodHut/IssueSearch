 URL : "https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/publication-RR-Jupyter/issues/33" TITLE : add a section on mybinder BODY : https://mybinder.org is live now and would be great to teach students how to use. to use it is - put url of github repo into https://mybinder.org - copy code from the badge button to put into the readme - add that code to the readme - click on it to launch we would also have to teach people how to use github to create repos and push files, but i think that would also be useful in this workshop, and was something that people requested in the r version.
