 URL : "https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/issues/6097" TITLE : want zil pipelining BODY : right now, concurrent synchronous operations block on zil. while we do batching, the blocking adds latency. if we could pipeline zil so that we can begin preparing new lwbs while zio is writing out the current commit, concurrent synchronous io performance should improve, especially in terms of latencies. by the way, i have written a preliminary patch at work. there is 1 space leak bug that i need to fix. after fixing it, the plan is to put it into a pull request. i am just filing this a little early to let people know that the patch is imminent. :
