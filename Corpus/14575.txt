 URL : "https://github.com/vgstation-coders/vgstation13/issues/14879" TITLE : bagel: cryo setup BODY : description of issue the cryo tubes are over pressurized, they lack a gas pump to properly remove air from the cannister. right now the cannister just freely releases into the pipe, causing the tubes to be way higher kpa then they should be. difference between expected and actual behavior tubes lack a gas pump, they over pressurize. steps to reproduce load map, check pressure in pipes.
