 URL : "https://github.com/BucknellSustainability/Flower/issues/176" TITLE : create sql setup script BODY : it would be cool to have a script that has all of the commands needed to auto build the whole db or maybe parts events, triggers, tables . that way if we ever needed to start new, migrate, or if someone wanted to set up a similar system, we could use this script to make the db. this would allow us to change the schema and other stuff easily by building the db again after nuking it... not sure if this is the best idea, but could have it's advantages.
