 URL : "https://github.com/veraPDF/veraPDF-parser/issues/192" TITLE : content stream operators BODY : verapdf of verapdf-1.1.29-gf-installer.zip claims that there are operators in operators1.pdf https://github.com/verapdf/verapdf-parser/files/789718/operators1.pdf that are not defined in the pdf reference pdf/a-1b clause 6.2.10 test 1 . i cannot see any such operator and removing either n or /cs0 cs from object 16 makes the validation failure go away. therefore i suspect a bug in the content stream parser.
