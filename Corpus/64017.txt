 URL : "https://github.com/no-go/AnotherRSS/issues/16" TITLE : feeds don't load at all BODY : i'd like to try out your app but i can't seem to get it to work. started it, waited for some time but the indicator just keeps on spinning and no feeds in the list would load. app's traffic log on the phone shows no traffic at all mobile and wifi and the app doesn't ask for any permissions either, which it should do on android 6 + , at least for storage. help is appreciated! ðŸ˜ƒ
