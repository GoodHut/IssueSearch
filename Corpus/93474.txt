 URL : "https://github.com/prescottprue/react-redux-firebase/issues/142" TITLE : add typings for typescript BODY : currently no typings for typescript are available, are there any plans to add them? i found no information regarding typescript support. right now using typescript with noimplicitany option activated it's only possible to require the package like so typescript const reactreduxfirebase = require 'react-redux-firebase' ; const { firebaseconnect, isloaded, isempty, datatojs, pathtojs } = reactreduxfirebase; because typings are missing the development experience is not as good as it could be in a typescript environment. this intro https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/introduction.html shows how to add them and why they are useful. additional info: $ npm info @types/react-redux-firebase npm err! darwin 16.5.0 npm err! argv /usr/local/cellar/node@6/6.10.3/bin/node /usr/local/bin/npm info @types/react-redux-firebase npm err! node v6.10.3 npm err! npm v4.2.0 npm err! code e404 npm err! 404 registry returned 404 for get on https://registry.npmjs.org/@types%2freact-redux-firebase npm err! 404 npm err! 404 '@types/react-redux-firebase' is not in the npm registry. npm err! 404 you should bug the author to publish it or use the name yourself! npm err! 404 npm err! 404 note that you can also install from a npm err! 404 tarball, folder, http url, or git url. npm err! please include the following file with any support request: npm err! /users/fmueller/.npm/_logs/2017-05-24t11_04_33_311z-debug.log
