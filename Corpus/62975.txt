 URL : "https://github.com/fastify/fastify/issues/235" TITLE : customize error message BODY : hi, i'm looking for a solution to customize the error message in fastify. it looks like it's not possible with the onresponse because i only have access to the raw serverresponse object. i also found extendservererror but i can't check which errors occurred and i also cant use my own format without to extend it. js fastify.addhook onresponse , res, next => { // i want to be flexible like this if resp.error instanceof unauthorized { return { code: resp.error.code, message: resp.error.msg } } ..... next } js fastify.extendservererror => { // which type of error ocurred? return { timestamp: new date } }
