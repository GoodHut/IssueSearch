 URL : "https://github.com/NewRelic-Python-Plugins/newrelic-python-agent/issues/15" TITLE : new plugin within newrelic BODY : currently when you use our fork, your metrics are still displayed in newrelic as the poison pen, llc meetme plugin. this means that users still get sent to their repo for support and we don't have control over the dashboards in new relic. since we don't have currently support anything different i don't think this is a major issue, and possibly one we can wait for until we start writing our new plugins.
