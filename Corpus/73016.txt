 URL : "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/issues/213" TITLE : coap block-wise transfer BODY : i have a question regarding the coap implementation. i like that it is able to manage automatically the block-wise transfer, sending a new request to the server if more blocks are available https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/blob/develop/os/net/app-layer/coap/coap-engine.c l432 , but i would like to know if there is a way to break this loop. i explain my question with two use cases: - a client sends a get request to a resource, without expecting a block-wise transfer, just a single response. however, the server starts a block-wise transfer adding the block option and the client has no way to stop it. - while handling the blocks received from the server an error happens and the client wants to stop the request and do not receive other blocks. from my understanding of er-coap, there is no supported way to do it. i found a way to do it with some small edits to er-coap but i would like to know if there is something i'm missing or if er-coap already supports this feature. if not i think it should either let the user manage the block-wise transfer like libcoap does , or give to the user a way to stop the request.
