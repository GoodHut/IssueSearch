 URL : "https://github.com/DarkRoleplay/Dark-Roleplay-Medieval/issues/8" TITLE : bugs in v0.2.0 for mc 1.12 BODY : hello i enjoy your mod and it fits nicely into my modpack, while playing around i found some issues: minor: - the correct past tense of download is downloaded , not downloadet . there might be more typos, you might want to get it checked out by an english native. - most blocks with the name acacia have incorrect localisation. check your lang file. - wheat and barley dough have incorrect localisation. major: - the crate's gui has a missing texture. - the game crashes when trying to preview rustic's iron lattice pressing shift . the problem might be on rustic's end but i'll leave it here too. https://pastebin.com/btbrdcwj
