 URL : "https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/232" TITLE : new transaction formats BODY : specification when block.number >= fork_blknum , allow two new types of transaction: 0, network_id, nonce, gasprice, startgas, to, value, data, v, r, s 1, network_id, startgas, to, data the first type of transaction replicates the functionality of existing regular transactions, with the sender equal to ecrecover sha3 rlp.encode 0, network_id, nonce, gasprice, startgas, to, value, data , v, r, s , and the second type replicates the functionality of eip 208 formerly eip 86 transactions, where the sender is set to null_sender a constant equal to 2^160 - 1 . when block.number >= deprecation_blknum set deprecation_blknum = fork_blknum + 100000 , disallow the older transaction types. rationale creates a cleaner and more forward-compatible way of representing transactions, as well as removing technical debt created by eip 208 and eip 155 and replacing it with more explicit mechanisms that achieve the same function. also, upgrades replay protection with etc and other alt-ethereum chains by making it compulsory and two-way.
