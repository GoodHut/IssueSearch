 URL : "https://github.com/tomv564/LSP/issues/186" TITLE : errors popup too fast BODY : i'm finding that the error pane is popping up as i'm in the middle of typing a phrase. obviously while the line is unfinished, the syntax is not correct, that's just distracting. as such, i think it would be helpful to add some kind of delay before triggering the error popup panel. even better would be to make the delay configurable.
