 URL : "https://github.com/Bioconductor/GenomicDataCommons/issues/41" TITLE : magrittr in depends field BODY : hi sean @seandavi, on second thought, it seems like it would be more convenient to keep magrittr in the depends: . this would avoid all of the library calls in the examples. usually, the depends: field is used if the current package extends the that package. taking a quick look at organism.dplyr , @mtmorgan puts dplyr in the depends field: https://github.com/bioconductor/organism.dplyr/blob/master/description l16 @mtmorgan thoughts? thanks, marcel
