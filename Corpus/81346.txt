 URL : "https://github.com/07th-mod/umineko-question/issues/61" TITLE : witch voices do not play BODY : hi all, i'm playing the steam version of this game. overall, the patch seems to work backgrounds and sprites are all ps3 version, and most voices play , but for some reason, voices for beatrice, bernkastel, lambdadelta, and stakes of purgatory do not play and presumably other witches, but i've only finished the first two episodes so far . so, for example, in tea party 1, all voices play as expected except for beatrice's; likewise, while skipping to another character's line ordinarily cuts off the preceding character's line, if the next line's is beatrice's, the preceding character finishes their line normally. for clarity, i installed the patch after finishing 2 episodes, not after originally installing the game, and i installed the 2.5 patch directly over the original game, with no intermediate patches.
