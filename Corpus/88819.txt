 URL : "https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint/issues/79" TITLE : output is ugly on windows BODY : the console formatting stuff in the output should be excluded when on windows. the output looks like this: c:\users\waylan\desktop>yamllint sample.yml ← 4msample.yml← 0m ← 2m1:1← 0m ← 33mwarning← 0m missing document start --- ← 2m document-start ← 0m ← 2m4:9← 0m ← 31merror← 0m wrong indentation: expected 10 but found 8 ← 2m indentation ← 0m ... which is pretty hard to read. of course the -f parsable format works okay as a work-around, but that shouldn't be necessary. c:\users\waylan\desktop>yamllint -f parsable sample.yml sample.yml:1:1: warning missing document start --- document-start sample.yml:4:9: error wrong indentation: expected 10 but found 8 indentation
