 URL : "https://github.com/modoboa/modoboa/issues/1297" TITLE : remote sql authentication BODY : impacted versions modoboa: latest installer used: yes webserver: nginx steps to reproduce run installer with 'installer.cfg' the following options set: engine = mysql host = 1.1.1.1 current behavior when using a remote sql server modoboa fails. some tables are not created for each database - spamassassin, amavis and modoboa. it appears that at some point during the installation script modoboa sets the sql account to use 'modoboa@localhost', causing the remote sql server to reject authentication attempts. does modoboa support remote sql server authentication?
