 URL : "https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/issues/5867" TITLE : 360/panorama photo viewer BODY : equirectangular 360 photos seem to be rendered as standard large images. there are several examples of content-sensitive handling for this type of image on the web. facebook, for example, creates a continuously 2d-scrollable view-port onto the wrapped image, and allows an initial viewport to be specified on upload. can we replicate such an interface? - https://pannellum.org/ is one example of a webgl-based viewer seemingly designed for webapp integration. - given local caching of images, maybe we can do an entirely local decision for when to swap in the image viewer, based on exif data? - is there an obvious way to add initial-viewport metadata to a toot with 360 media? appending polar coordinates to the url? - x i searched or browsed the repoâ€™s other issues to ensure this is not a duplicate. - this bug happens on a tagged release https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/releases and not on master if you're a user, don't worry about this .
