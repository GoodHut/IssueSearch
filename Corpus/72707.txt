 URL : "https://github.com/kobalicek/amdtweak/issues/4" TITLE : cannot write to pp table BODY : i'm running linux 4.12 with the proprietary opencl kernel from amdgpu-pro, but it doesn't matter right? with an rx 470 and trying to reproduce the example in the readme, i noticed i can't write to powertunetable.tdp nor to powertunetable.configurabletdp. as soon as i do, the pp table becomes permanently until reboot irresponsive. as in cat /sys/class/drm/card0/device/pp_table never returns, amdtweak hangs forever if used to read it and radeon-profile hangs as well. also, unigine valley slows down from 40 fps to 10. is it because the clocks lower to the mininum? i don't know, i have no way to check without the pp table lol. any clue? i haven't tried writing any other variable yet, but i suspect it will be the same
