 URL : "https://github.com/henn/qubes-app-split-ssh/issues/1" TITLE : can't get it to work BODY : hi, thanks for putting this together! unfortunately i can't get it to work. i'm confused by the instructions: template for ssh vault: copy qubes.sshagent to /etc/qubes-rpc/qubes.sshagent in the template image for the ssh vault vm. qubes.sshagent needs to run at startup in the appvm that would like to use the key, as it makes the conduit of the ssh agent forwarding the first sentence says to copy the qubes.sshagent to the template of the vault vm. the second sentence says that that service needs to run in the 'appvm that would like to use the key', e.g the client, not the vault. does it need to go in both templates of vault and client e.g if they are different and how to run the service at startup? far as i can tell, there's no ncat processes in either my client or vault. i made sure to set /rw/config/rc.local executable in the client vm. appreciate any help! it is really exciting to have split-ssh. thanks!
