 URL : "https://github.com/projectfluent/projectfluent.github.io/issues/2" TITLE : update ace highlighting BODY : i'd like to change how the highlighting works. i believe that red as the color for text is confusing as usually syntax highlighting uses red when something is wrong. i'd like to suggest: message id to be purple text to be black placeables to be dark blue variables to be green message references to be purple variant keywords to be dark blue @stasm what do you think?
