 URL : "https://github.com/FAC10/week1-jzlp/issues/62" TITLE : css: usage of rem and em BODY : what is the teams reason for using rem and em in css? you've been pretty consistent in using rem with the exception of a couple of places in the project where you've used em here https://github.com/fac10/week1-jzlp/blob/master/public/assets/css/styles.css l171 and here https://github.com/fac10/week1-jzlp/blob/master/public/assets/css/styles.css l183 . if you want to use rem throughout i'd recommend that you have a top level default which everyone in the team is aware of. for e.g. css html { font-size: 16px; / for rem size declarations / font-family: 'ubuntu', helvetica, ariel, sans-serif; } body { min-height: 100vh; background-color: fafafa; font-size: 1rem; / 16px / margin: auto; } having this at the top level means that you are now basing the rem of a known size, for the above case its 16px. finally being really picky but the media query width size should also be in rems so that we are using it consistently and not mixing and matching with px , rem & em great job! :smile:
