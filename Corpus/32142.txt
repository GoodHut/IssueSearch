 URL : "https://github.com/bazelbuild/tulsi/issues/13" TITLE : tulsi build failing BODY : i am trying to build a simple xcode project using tulsi, but the tulsi build keeps failing in xcode anytime i try to run the project. the error is bazel build failed . i followed all the instructions and purposely made the xcode project very simple yet it still still fails. i attached a screen shot of my file structure, the workspace file, and the build file. the bazel executable i'm using is what i downloaded from https://bazel.build/versions/master/docs/install-compile-source.html. please let me know if i can provide any more info to see why it keep failing. thank you. <img width= 614 alt= screen shot 2017-04-19 at 5 32 43 pm src= https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8551495/25203177/3ce83a8a-2526-11e7-92b3-f9ad38ecc733.png > workspace.txt https://github.com/bazelbuild/tulsi/files/938558/workspace.txt build.txt https://github.com/bazelbuild/tulsi/files/938559/build.txt
