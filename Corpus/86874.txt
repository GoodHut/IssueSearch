 URL : "https://github.com/badaix/snapcast/issues/209" TITLE : in-tree buildroot support BODY : i am a maintainer of buildroot and i'd like to add snapcast as a package to buildroot without the need for using an external tree. therefore, i already added popl and asio as packages not mainline yet . the snapcast makefile needs some adjustments to get it into mainline: - remove of -isystem not needed, not safe - do not strip by default buildroot has an option for this - use pkg-config for needed libraries - identify required and optional dependencies - for optional dependencies, allow passing a variable through the environment, e.g. have_ogg , if the build system has ogg enabled this is what would be done by ./configure - support static builds maybe it's time for autotools or cmake? if this is done properly there is no need to distinguish between openwrt, buildroot, or any other similar linux system.
