 URL : "https://github.com/minimalchat/operator-app/issues/101" TITLE : handle multiple operators BODY : problem description: when there are multiple people with operator application open there is no visibility into who is chatting with who. this may cause confusion, and at worst multiple operators replying to the same client. suggested solution: one possible solution to increase visibility is to show the operator avatar on a chat they currently have active. along with this, we could show the avatar in the message list like we do for the client. these two added features along with support for gravatars in this ticket https://github.com/minimalchat/operator-app/issues/95 would allow operators to know when someone else is looking at a chat and know when another operator has already engaged with a client.
