 URL : "https://github.com/grommet/grommet/issues/1367" TITLE : no textarea component? BODY : is there support for textarea that expands as you input more lines, and scales down as you erase lines? i found textinput, which oddly results in page reload on pressing enter oh how many times pressing enter has resulted in accidental submission and page reload... i hope you guys fix this , and also tried adding ordinary <textarea/> inside formfield, resulting in weird padding and ugly scrollbar who on earth scrolls through textareas? . any ideas how to get decent textarea?
