 URL : "https://github.com/Sklore/HL_DD_5e_Colab/issues/583" TITLE : release preparation 1.8 BODY : looks like we are pretty clean from a bugs perspective so i suggest we do a release to get those backgrounds fixed. @shadowchemosh - when you get the chance can you please do your magic. i will update the release notes. note: this update will remove support for all kobold press products. this was done because it's the right thing to do, i have not been asked to remove the support, i just don't want us standing in the way of companies who are working to make hero lab a better product.
