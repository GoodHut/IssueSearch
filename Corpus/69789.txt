 URL : "https://github.com/valor-software/ng2-bootstrap/issues/1441" TITLE : typeahead ngmodel value BODY : i'm using an array of objects as my options source. from what i can tell, it's impossible to get the full item object set as the ngmodel. my ngmodel is only getting set to the typeaheadoptionfield value. is this intended, or is there a way to have the ngmodel be set to the item object?
