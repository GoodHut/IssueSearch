 URL : "https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/issues/461" TITLE : 2.9 dialog modal BODY : i feel that role=dialog should relay the same information to the screen reader user as region as far as defining the end of the modal's content. i think this really helps the screen reader user to know where the content ends. i know the modal is the only active container on the page but this still does not explicitly define the containers end point. thank you
