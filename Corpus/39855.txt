 URL : "https://github.com/Octavzz/Tea-Cozy/issues/4" TITLE : suggestion: id usage BODY : all of your stylings are done through classes, and while there's nothing wrong about that, the class selector is most often used on several elements. thus i'd recommend using a class when you want to consistently style multiple elements throughout the page/site. otherwise, for a single element on the page, use ids.
