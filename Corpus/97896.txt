BODY : hi we have the method i2c_master_stop cmd to finish our command. but in some situations it would be great to have something like i2c_master_end cmd : esp_err_t i2c_master_end i2c_cmd_handle_t cmd_handle { i2c_check cmd_handle != null, i2c_cmd_link_init_err_str, esp_err_invalid_arg ; i2c_cmd_t cmd; cmd.ack_en = 0; cmd.ack_exp = 0; cmd.ack_val = 0; cmd.byte_num = 0; cmd.data = null; cmd.op_code = i2c_cmd_end; return i2c_cmd_link_append cmd_handle, &cmd ; } i have a scenario where i want to write one byte to slave register address and read after this write the data back. like: write 0x30 to slave 0x10. than read back 11 bytes the 0x30 is the internal slave data register address in my case the geginning of deviceid - so the slave will move the pointer to that offset. and on read request it will send 11 bytes back to master. i used before the arduinoesp32 and there is a way to hand over sendstop flag - which is exactly the same as cmd.op_code = i2c_cmd_end so my question is - is this method i2c_master_end needed, or how is it done in esp32 idf? thx and cheers, jorgen
