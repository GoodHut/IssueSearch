 URL : "https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/issues/1506" TITLE : smart select pushstate? BODY : hi, android users are trying to click back on an opened smart select control but that causes app to close for example , it would be awesome to have smart select change the pushstate like you did for dynamic page add / content-1 to the url, and close the smart select on back, that'd be more easy and needed solution. thanks.
