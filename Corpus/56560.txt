 URL : "https://github.com/EventStore/EventStore/issues/1236" TITLE : no acking takes place. BODY : hello there, i've got a persistent subscription set up on my localhost, v3.9.3, which i access like this: this.client = eventstoreconnection.create new ipendpoint ipaddress.parse ip_address , 1113 ; this.client.connectasync .wait ; this.client.connecttopersistentsubscription stream , stream-group , handler, autoack: true ; where handler is a delegate that's being passed in. the handler is called, and the event processed, but it seems no ack is being received by the server, as the current indicator on the competing consumers page is still empty. am i doing something wrong with this? thank you.
