 URL : "https://github.com/konklone/oversight.garden/issues/170" TITLE : updating to ruby 2.4.0 BODY : ruby 2.4.0 is out now, but it'll take some work to upgrade to it. ruby 2.4.0 changes how fixed point numbers are handled, which breaks the json gem prior to version 2.0.0. ruby on rails pulls in json, and only the very latest version of ror requires json 2.0.0 or later. we pull in ror directly for activemodel and indirectly by way of elasticsearch-persistence. this will hopefully resolve itself as more releases are cut. ! bundle viz https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/181772/21644089/6c5df9ee-d251-11e6-8db9-3d186952f4ba.png
