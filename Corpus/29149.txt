 URL : "https://github.com/Moneris/Moneris-RMS-Plugin/issues/1" TITLE : issue with refunds? BODY : we migrated from a td processor plugin to this one, and we're having issues with refunds. we have situations where we'll refund the products on a transaction, add a new item to replace the refunded , and it's miss-adding the values on the tender screen . i don't understand why the moneris plugin might be altering the math, as the way i see it , it should be just doing what rms tells it to do. but the situation is we were able to do this with the previous plugin, but now it's adding the values instead of subtracting. something about installing the plugin has caused it to mis-report the values, and now we have an accounting dilemma on how to resolve the problem. image explaining how subtraction is not addition: https://ibb.co/nhehma
