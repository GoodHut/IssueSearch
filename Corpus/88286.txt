 URL : "https://github.com/searchkit/searchkit/issues/486" TITLE : navigating back and forth BODY : hi joseph, we've just deployed a project that utilises searchkit. filtering a large resultset works with lightining speed, it's instant! http://www.zeelandnet.nl/prikbord/zoeken?rubriek 0 0 =auto%27s url however, if one is to click a product in the list and subsequently view the item on the productpage, the whole speedy-effect is ruined if one hits the back-button: _the whole shadow dom needs to be rendered again from scratch, whereas we previously had the listview available in the cache of the browser showing the list, where one came from, directly ._ is it possible to create something that 'remembers' the last compiled version of the list activated after you click on the productlink ? thanks again for your great work on searchkit! kind regards, marco troost
