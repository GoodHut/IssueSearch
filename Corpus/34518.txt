 URL : "https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-admin/issues/201" TITLE : clean out legacy css BODY : we've got a bad habit of just piling new css on top of old css in the cms. while bem has brought a bit more structure to the cms styling as a whole, there's still a lot of potentially unused css. it looks like there's no easy way to audit all cms views in their entirety - only a single view is possible e.g. with the chrome dev tools. that's not very useful. see https://unused-css.com/ for a comparison of options. related remove all legacy css browser hacks https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/issues/6298 use bootstrap styling throughout the cms https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/issues/5650 clean out ss-ui-button style use https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/issues/6479
