 URL : "https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/1124" TITLE : fyi: alpha version numbers BODY : hey, this isn't a bug, more of a just thought i'd let you know , but the alpha version scheme 1.0.0-alpha9 is not lexically sortable. you can test this by doing npm show gatsby versions --json : npm show gatsby versions --json 1.0.0-alpha2 , 1.0.0-alpha20 , 1.0.0-alpha21 , 1.0.0-alpha3 , 1.0.0-alpha4 , 1.0.0-alpha5 , 1.0.0-alpha6 , 1.0.0-alpha7 , 1.0.0-alpha8 , 1.0.0-alpha8-test1 , 1.0.0-alpha9 , 1.0.0-alpha9-test1 , ... the latest alpha 1.0.0-alpha21 doesn't show up at the end of the list. this can be remedied by naming it as 1.0.0-alpha.21 . from semver.org: > http://semver.org/ spec-item-9 > a pre-release version may be denoted by appending a hyphen and a series of dot separated identifiers immediately following the patch version. > examples: 1.0.0-alpha.1 ...snip great work on gatsby by the way!
