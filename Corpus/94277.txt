 URL : "https://github.com/choucrifahed/sbt-elm/issues/14" TITLE : building separate js files BODY : my play framework app delivers a number of separate html pages to the browser. rather than download elmmain.js into each of those pages, i would prefer each html page to download only the elm-generated javascript that it needs. for example, my configpage.html wants to embed elmconfigpage.js ; and my projectadmin.html wants to embed elmprojectadmin.js . can you imagine how i might be able to achieve that with sbt-elm? would it require a very significant change to sbt-elm?
