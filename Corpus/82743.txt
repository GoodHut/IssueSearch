 URL : "https://github.com/winterstein/sogive-app/issues/56" TITLE : app only shows one source BODY : at some point in the past not sure if this was before the app was first built? we only had one column for the source of the data. have now added a second column for this, but the code is not picking this up at the moment. example: vso voluntary services overseas https://app.sogive.org/ charity?charityid=voluntary-service-overseas-vso this page shows the source from source 1 http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/accounts/ends57/0000313757_ac_20160331_e_c.pdf but it doesn't show the source from source 2: https://www.vsointernational.org/sites/default/files/annualreport.pdf this was probably harder to do before because merged cells in the column heading may well have made this column harder to pick up, so i've just adjusted the column headings
