 URL : "https://github.com/JacobFischer/netlinkwrapper/issues/3" TITLE : file socket supports BODY : i am doing sync module handler for babel-watch. the module handler requires everything working in sync. so i have created a file socket between my babel transpile server and client using file socket. after that, i found that net module is async, which incompatible with module handler. i replace it by netlinkwrapper instead for doing the sync jobs. but i notice that it doesn't support file socket at the moment. any ideas or plan to support it? thanks.
