 URL : "https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/issues/877" TITLE : errors on timings? BODY : hi i need to turn on a sonoff pow and turn off it after a few seconds. for that i tried 2 different approaches: - pulsetime - backlog w/ delay in both cases i sometimes get the correct time but not always! : for instance: http://192.168.1.126/cm?cmnd=pulsetime 50 http://192.168.1.126/cm?cmnd=power 1 i get a 5s delay but almost half of the times i get 13s. http://192.168.1.126/cm?cmnd=pulsetime 100 http://192.168.1.126/cm?cmnd=power 1 i get a 10s but almost half of the times i get 17s. http://192.168.1.126/cm?cmnd=pulsetime 150 http://192.168.1.126/cm?cmnd=power 1 i get a 80s delay or sometimes 90s instead of the expected 50s as described in the wiki.. http://192.168.1.126/cm?cmnd=backlog power 1; delay 50; power 0 i get the expected 5s delay. http://192.168.1.126/cm?cmnd=backlog power 1; delay 100; power 0 i get the expected 10s delay. http://192.168.1.126/cm?cmnd=backlog power 1; delay 150; power 0 i get always an incorrect 23s delay. what is going on?!? regards, h√©lio ps - congratulations for this great sonoff-tasmota project!!!
