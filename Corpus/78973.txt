 URL : "https://github.com/perak/kitchen-site/issues/375" TITLE : request entity too large BODY : this isn't really a meteorkitchen specific problem, but rather a problem with iron-router. see here, for instance: https://github.com/iron-meteor/iron-router/issues/710 the solution seems to be to override router.configurebodyparsers in the following way: router.configurebodyparsers = function { router.onbeforeaction iron.router.bodyparser.urlencoded { extended : true, limit : '500mb' } , {where: 'server'} ; }; i've experimented with placing this code various places in the project but it doesn't work. could it be that meteorkitchen somehow overrides this code somewhere out of my control? or does anyone know of another solution?
