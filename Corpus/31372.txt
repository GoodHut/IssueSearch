 URL : "https://github.com/martinthenext/telegram-bot-aws/issues/3" TITLE : setting up webhooks BODY : this section https://github.com/martinthenext/telegram-bot-aws setting-up-webhooks of the docs has to contain instructions on how to set up a webhook from telegram to work with the api gateway. it has to have minimal possible setup to get the job done and minimal amount of manual steps. the best thing would be to write a script to automate all possible work on the aws side.
