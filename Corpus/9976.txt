 URL : "https://github.com/nicksnyder/go-i18n/issues/61" TITLE : add toml support BODY : as discussed in this thread: https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2577 we use go-i18n in hugo and it works great, but the number one related question we get on the support forum comes from people having a hard time getting their language files in yaml right. so it would be nice if go-i18n could support the simpler toml format and also optionally support a slightly flatter data format, so we could write: toml d_days one = {{.count}} day other = {{.count}} days string_id_2 other = some other translation
