 URL : "https://github.com/hortonworks/registry/issues/282" TITLE : apache incubator proposal? BODY : currently the schemaregistry project is growing at great pace, and getting great traction. one thing is that currently any contribution requires that copyright needs to be rescinded to hortonworks even though asl . as a contributor/committer i am a lot happier rescinding my personal copyright to an open source organisation like apache asf rather than to a commercial company hortonworks. i would like to see if those at hortonworks? would be willing to move the project to apache?
