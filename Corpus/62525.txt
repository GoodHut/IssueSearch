 URL : "https://github.com/greenelab/snorkeling/issues/19" TITLE : conda forge breaks lxml BODY : there is a bug when trying to rely on conda forge to install the python module lxml. right now if one were to create the conda environment and import lxml.etree, the following error will occur: >traceback most recent call last : > file <string> , line 1, in <module> > importerror: libicui18n.so.56: cannot open shared object file: no such file or directory therefore, i argue that we move lxml to be a pip dependency as installing lxml through that way fixes it.
