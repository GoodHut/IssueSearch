 URL : "https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/21952" TITLE : improve stackalloc il emit BODY : it seems very brute-force we can do: - stackalloc t 0 - just becomes default of the lhs type - stackalloc byte x - no need to emit 1 - stackalloc int 128 - we could constant-fold 128 4 - unused stackalloc is not sideeffecting. the only possible sideeffect is stackoverflow - that is hardly deterministic or can be observed as a dependency.
