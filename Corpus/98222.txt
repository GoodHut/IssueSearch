 URL : "https://github.com/jtwig/jtwig/issues/327" TITLE : include template fallbacks BODY : original twig include allows one to set a list of templates, which will use the first one that exists, throwing an error if none are found. example: {% include 'page_detailed.html', 'page.html' %} for the above example, the current behavior is to send 'page_detailed.html', 'page.html' directly to the resourceloader, when it should parse that string and send each piece to the resourceloader. see twig 'include' documentation http://twig.sensiolabs.org/doc/2.x/tags/include.html
