 URL : "https://github.com/christiancosgrove/pytorch-spectral-normalization-gan/issues/1" TITLE : slef.u can't be updated? BODY : the self.u in spectralnorm seems never update during training. and u in spectral_norm will be reinitialized with u = variable w.data.new w.data.shape 1 .data.normal_ 0,1 in every epoch. the type of self.u is _none_ all the time. any way to figure this out? thanks!
