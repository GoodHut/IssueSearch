 URL : "https://github.com/korotovsky/SingleSignOnServiceProviderBundle/issues/6" TITLE : guzzle / otp process BODY : hello & thanks again for your great work ! i've restarted the project on a clean installation and now it's better. i still have some troubles and i suppose some misunderstanding : 1- when the consumer is called i get redirected to the idp uri but i always have a malformed uri : false === $httputils->checkurl $request->getschemeandhttphost .$request->getrequesturi this should be a secret problem i suppose hash control? : i do have the same secret keyword into parameters and consumer conf secret_parameter. any ideas ? 2- in the meantime i removed the exception to follow up & i so i get redirected to the login form just installed a minimal sf login process , after login on idp with the correct credentials i get the json correct response from internal/v1/sso/ instead of arriving to the landing page. it's an url redirect ? it must be a guzzle configuration problem ? thanks btw you can have a look at this docker for symfony https://github.com/mediafigaro/docker-symfony
