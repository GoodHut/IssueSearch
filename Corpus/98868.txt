 URL : "https://github.com/raamdev/independent-publisher/issues/290" TITLE : links in quotes and asides BODY : i was a bit surprised quotes and asides strip the link out of the text, modifying the post entries content. i like the fact that title isn't shown for them, and i guess that's the reason why links are stripped so the own text acts as a link to the individual post? . in individual posts, the links are there, but the styling makes it difficult to see them if you are unaware of them which, as a reader, you are . would you consider a feature request / pull request that brings back the links in asides and quotes?
