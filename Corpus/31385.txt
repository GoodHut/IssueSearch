BODY : i want to setup http polling and iam using ngrx effects. i've tried to get some help from stackoverflow but no successful answers yet. this might not be a github appropriate posting, but even the example app does not help here. @injectable export class taskseffects { constructor private actions$: actions, private ts: taskservice {} @effect onloadtasksloadtasks$: observable<action> = this.actions$.oftype tasksactions.actiontypes.load_tasks .switchmap => { return this.ts.index .map res => new tasksactions.loadtaskssuccessaction res.json .catch err => of new tasksactions.loadtasksfailaction err ; } ; i want the switchmap internals to repeat every ten seconds. i've tried many different operators, repeat , retry coupled with debouncetime . also tried to setup a observable.interval 10000 with combineall , but couldn't get it to work. other help available online tells me that i should be using interval 10000 , but that gives an error. property interval does not exist on type 'observable<loadtasksfailaction>' please advise.
