 URL : "https://github.com/rails-oceania/melbourne-ruby/issues/79" TITLE : functional affairs in ruby BODY : recently, there has been a buzz about fp functional programming , and there has been a lot of rubyist start exploring fp languages like elixir, clojure, scala, and haskell. in this talk, i'd like to present about what's the buzz with fp, why we care about fp, and ultimately how do we apply this fp concept back in our day to day code as a rubyist. i will show and explore the power of ruby to do fp things, such as: lambda, higher order function, currying, and composition. then introducing library like transproc https://github.com/solnic/transproc , dry monads https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-monads , and dry transaction https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-transaction , and how we can use this library to apply fp pattern such as railway oriented programming http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/rop/ on daily problems that we are solving as rubyist. this talk will be intermediate level, and will roughly take about 40 minutes. thanks.
