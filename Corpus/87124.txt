 URL : "https://github.com/mikedh/trimesh/issues/122" TITLE : is it really watertight ? BODY : hi, after the issue i opened 100 , i still encounter some problems when i try to validate a stl. let's take this one: test2.stl.txt https://github.com/mikedh/trimesh/files/1592911/test2.stl.txt when i test it with freecad, i get 0 non-manifolds. but when i test it with trimesh, is_watertight is false. i tried to show the mesh with coloured faces, but i can't spot the faulty ones. i'm almost sure there is no non-manifolds at least theoretically, when i build the model , so could you help me understand what's wrong here ? cheers
