 URL : "https://github.com/rich-iannone/DiagrammeR/issues/243" TITLE : url attribute for nodes BODY : hi, i use your package for a year now to create graph in shiny apps. users are are enthusiastic and ask me for enhancements like beeing able to click on a node to access specific url. by looking at the graphviz doc and the generate_dot function i found that adding url to the node_attributes vector would solve my problem. i've done it and it worked. i'm not used enough to package developpement and to your package in particular to know if this is the right thing to do. i've seen edgeurl, headurl and tailurl already existed and was wondering why url did not. i'd like to know if this enhancement could be incorporated in your package and if yes how could i help ? other tests, pull request, ... thanks
