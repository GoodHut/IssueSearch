 URL : "https://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp/issues/45" TITLE : .net 4.5.2 support BODY : hi i'm stuck with 4.5.2 at my workplace, but would very much like to use this serializer. although the documentation and nuget package look like this is supported, trying to run under 4.5.2 fails due to a system.runtime 4.0.20.0 requirement. is this intended? many thanks chris chandler
