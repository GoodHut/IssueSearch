 URL : "https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/issues/1606" TITLE : define compliance levels BODY : before we release 1.0 we should define which parts actually make elektra, and must be present in every libelektra implementation. we should also define parts beyond the api: - what are the library names and how to locate the libraries. - which tools are available. - which plugins must work or even test plugin compliance in both ways . - the meaning of keys below /elektra and maybe even other parts of the key database - which test cases test which kind of compliance thus all parts of elektra would be too big, we should define some levels of compliance, so that also small libelektra implementations have a chance to reach some level of compliance.
