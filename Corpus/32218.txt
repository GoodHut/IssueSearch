 URL : "https://github.com/xmartlabs/XLPagerTabStrip/issues/324" TITLE : unable to pass data BODY : i am running the newest version of ios & xcode i know how to pass data from one vc to the next using performsegue, however this situation is a little different. calendarvc - holds the data transfers to calendardetailsvc when a date is selected from the calendar calendardetailsvc - holds xlpagertabstrip calendardetailsbsvc - needs to display variables form calendarvc when i try: in calendarvc since it has the data override func prepare for segue: uistoryboardsegue, sender: any? { let destination = segue.destination as! calendardetailsbsvc let test = sdfdsfdsf destination.test = test } i have a var test: string? variable in my calendardetailsbsvc but the program crashes with: could not cast value of type 'appname.calendardetailsvc' 0x10152e648 to 'appname.calendardetailsbsvc' 0x10152eba8 . i have also tried accessing the variable directly from calendardetailbsvc, but no luck since the variable lives inside another class' function and thus i can't access it it needs to be modified there how can i accomplish transferring this data? thank you
