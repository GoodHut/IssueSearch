 URL : "https://github.com/18F/cf-cdn-service-broker/issues/91" TITLE : handle invalid challenges BODY : in certain cases such as a dnssec failure le will mark a challenge as invalid but the broker will continue to try to solve it failing with an error unable to update challenge :: the challenge is not pending. the broker should either request new challenges when this happens, or mark the instance as failed so the customer can perform an update operation on the instance to force new challenges to be issued. cc: @wslack @jmcarp references: - https://logs.fr.cloud.gov/app/kibana /doc/logs-app /logs-app-2017.08.23/logmessage/?id=av4rybgmfszapdgt-ncg
