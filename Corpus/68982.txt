 URL : "https://github.com/Tylemagne/Gopher360/issues/55" TITLE : speed selection removal BODY : i am truly enjoying the new update and it's smoothness, but there's a thing i don't like with one of your previous updates, specifically the one where you added lb as speed selection button. now, i understand this is useful to people who use this program for browsing, but not for me who uses it to start the day off playing some skyrim : when ever i use the lb in-game i hear the sound of speed selection... if there is a way to remove the sound from it that would make the program perfect for me.
