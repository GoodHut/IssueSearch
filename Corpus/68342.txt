 URL : "https://github.com/rdfhdt/hdt-java/issues/49" TITLE : return instead of write BODY : i have used the hdt package for a while using my own fork but it would be great if the following could be implemented if not already present: https://github.com/rdfhdt/hdt-java/commit/cc8526958cf526a6bdac80bbbce010d4fe0f1ea5 when a query is executed i would like to have an option to return the results like: resultset results = qe.execselect ; return results; such that it can be directly incorporated into other programs. or is this already possible?
