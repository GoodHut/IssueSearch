 URL : "https://github.com/jgeumlek/MoltenGamepad/issues/31" TITLE : output slots on demand BODY : with the rest of mg stabilizing, it is time to consider allowing the number of virtual gamepads to change during runtime. right now the user can only control the number that might get input sources mapped to them . when trying to assign an input source and all output slots are full, why not add a new virtual device? persistent devices are still useful for games that don't handle disconnecting controllers, so the user should be able to specify a minimum number of slots to maintain. might as well also allow for a maximum to be specified. player numbering becomes a mess, but it was already a bit of a mess, and is a reasonable sacrifice in this setting.
