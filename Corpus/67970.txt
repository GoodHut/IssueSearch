 URL : "https://github.com/smartsteader/beta/issues/27" TITLE : rearrange feature, etc. BODY : on ios i'm doing beta & bill is using current version when rearranging the order of area of production: can we delay how quickly the swipe needs to happen when holding the 3 lines? if you don't swipe it literally simultaneously with the touch, the line of production flashes and then won't move. also, when you press the 3 lines to the left of production records to go to the account details, we both naturally wanted to swipe the production records page back to close the account details page instead of pressing the 3 lines again. finally, when choosing a record to edit a tap doesn't do anything, you need to hold it. felt broken at first.
