 URL : "https://github.com/angular/quickstart/issues/398" TITLE : cannot find name 'module' BODY : in atom editor, i tried to add the line moduleid: module.id, to a @component decorator but the editor reports an error cannot find name 'module' if i ignore it, everything seems to be fine and the example works, but it is annoying. is there any way how to get rid of this problem? i realise it needn't be in the quickstart project.
