 URL : "https://github.com/anttiviljami/wp-libre-form/issues/54" TITLE : add simple spam prevention BODY : imo wplf should contain very basic spam prevention which is built-in and hidden feature. one option to achieve this is to add a honeypot field, but is it effective way anymore? another option that did come to my mind, is detect if akismet is activated and use it. i was also wondering if we should save, mark and delete spam after a x amount of days example same cycle with comment spam or not. opinions?
