 URL : "https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/issues/50" TITLE : timezone and dst BODY : there are a ton of problems with the current date object and i'm really thankful to see this project get going. just to pick one of the problems... can we avoid the misleading method .gettimezoneoffset which conflates both the tz and dst offsets. these are very different things and it's often useful to have both values. getting the difference between utc and wall-clock time is a common use case, but let's call it something like .getlocaloffset instead.
