 URL : "https://github.com/WorldBrain/WebMemex/issues/81" TITLE : change of database + dat BODY : just had a call with alexander praetorius, who gave me a lot of good tips for libraries we can use instead of pouchdb and adapters to use for dat. just leaving them here, so we can discuss about them, also related to the sharing network: https://github.com/beakerbrowser/hashbase https://github.com/mafintosh/hypercore https://github.com/mafintosh/hypervision https://github.com/mafintosh/hyperdb alternatively: https://github.com/beakerbrowser/injestdb https://github.com/levelgraph/levelgraph as a graph database alternatively gun.js.org, however the latter is a separate application which does not integrate so hyperdb, injestdb,levelgraph, hypercore and hashbase modularly integrate/build on top of each other very well with leveldb, so we can use it in the browser's native database + on the server as well.
