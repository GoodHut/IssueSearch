 URL : "https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux/issues/66" TITLE : rule 1 & 2 clarification BODY : the rules state that: > 1. must export default a function called reducer > 2. must export its action creators as functions and the example syntax uses function as opposed to arrow function syntax, does this mean that the reducer and action creators shouldn't be arrow functions or did i misunderstand this? and if so, how come? thanks
