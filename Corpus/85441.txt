 URL : "https://github.com/eclipse/smarthome/issues/4612" TITLE : factory methods for state BODY : i noticed that quite some bindings have there own utility class / methods to do a null check and conditionally convert it to either undeftype.null or the respective value, some examples: nestbasehandler https://github.com/openhab/openhab2-addons/blob/master/addons/binding/org.openhab.binding.netatmo/src/main/java/org/openhab/binding/netatmo/internal/channeltypeutils.java nestbasehandler @ line 109 https://github.com/openhab/openhab2-addons/blob/8f7c32ce13b89e0bd913758e158b5b55eae7ecd6/addons/binding/org.openhab.binding.nest/src/main/java/org/openhab/binding/nest/handler/nestbasehandler.java l109 kodihandler.java @ line 399 https://github.com/openhab/openhab2-addons/blob/f238e11e8b61def4d1247e37df32be45a319377f/addons/binding/org.openhab.binding.kodi/src/main/java/org/openhab/binding/kodi/handler/kodihandler.java l399 i think that this should/could be the responsibility of the framework, imho every method for which it is sensible should have one or more nullable valueof methods. which return either undeftype.null or the wrapper class of the requested type. i would also suggest to change the meaning of decimaltype.valueof https://github.com/eclipse/smarthome/blob/36c9e2717e4f89cf60a0d885e7ecc6069b338f48/bundles/core/org.eclipse.smarthome.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/smarthome/core/library/types/decimaltype.java l68 to allow null and handle it properly. i can / would like to make this pr but if people already reject it would be waste of time, so what do you think? cc: @maggu2810 @sjka @htreu ps: maybe i would even like to mark the constructors deprecated for touched classes...
