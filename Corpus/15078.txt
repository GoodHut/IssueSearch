 URL : "https://github.com/HewlettPackard/quartz/issues/5" TITLE : cpu support issue BODY : looks like by default, only 3 cpus are supported: in /src/lib/cpu/known_cpus.h line 21: cpu_model_t known_cpus = { &cpu_model_intel_xeon_ex_v3, &cpu_model_intel_xeon_ex_v2, &cpu_model_intel_xeon_ex, 0 }; my question is, can we add our own cpu model names into this without causing any trouble, as long as the cpu i use is in the three processor families: sandy bridge, ivy bridge, and haswellï¼Ÿ
