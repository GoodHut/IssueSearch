 URL : "https://github.com/TylerGarlick/wrecked/issues/5" TITLE : payload behavior is odd BODY : i was having trouble sending some requests when i moved from wreck to this module. i traced it to this line: https://github.com/tylergarlick/wrecked/blob/master/src/infrastructure/wreck.js l47 the issue is, the default wreck behavior accepts an object that can be serialized using json.stringify . by coercing non-streams and non-buffers to strings with util.inspect you break what i believe is a common behavior of providing a json object as a payload. i would propose just eliminating the coercion, as wreck itself seems to do a good job figuring out what the payload is.
