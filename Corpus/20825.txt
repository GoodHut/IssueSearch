 URL : "https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/323" TITLE : custom layouts dir BODY : from this line https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/blob/fbca3d7f78da1edb04bde21fddcc981f562f8fb4/lib/build.js l148 it seems layouts can only be loaded from srcdir/layouts , is there any chance to add a layoutdir option in nuxt config? my use case is that i want to put all pages in srcdir but put layouts elsewhere.
