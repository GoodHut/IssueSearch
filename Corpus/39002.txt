 URL : "https://github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_core/issues/1594" TITLE : remove seticon files BODY : there is this rpc class named seticonrequest and seticonresponse on the mobile side, and uiseticonrequest and uiseticonresponse on the hmi side. however these rpcs are not defined in any of the apis and are not referenced anywhere in core. i think these are an old copy paste error of the setappicon rpc.
