 URL : "https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-iOS/issues/2645" TITLE : registration flow issues BODY : here are some of the most common problems with our registration flow. they're included together rather than as separate issues because there are some overlapping design concerns. problem: users request sms multiple times since there is a delay in receiving it. when the sms arrives the verification is no longer valid since the user has already requested a new one. same if they initially requested an sms then request a call and both are delayed problem: need users to check country code and special case formatting -- mexico +521 , argentina +549 , brazil +5521 example problem: users register another mobile device i.e. an ipad or second phone thinking they can link the two. they are not aware that registering a second device deactivates the first device problem: users unaware that there is no white list feature of signal and that anyone with their number who is also a signal user can message them. android's solution via more information text: signal makes it easy to communicate by using your existing phone number and address book. friends and contact who already know how ot contact you by phone will be able to easily get in touch by signal. registration transmits some contact information to the server. it is not stored. problem: when submitting a verification code, it is relatively easy to tap on request new code inadvertently
