 URL : "https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/issues/3680" TITLE : bulk license checkout BODY : feature request: we have over 2000 desktops/laptops and want to put our volume licensing keys on here so we can keep track of seats. going to be a lengthy job assigning 2000 windows 10 licenses and 2000 office licensed... this is similar to issue 588 but instead of assets its for licenses instead. i cant see this being a big job... maybe it is i don't know but bulk checkout of licenses would be a huge help for it admins like myself.
