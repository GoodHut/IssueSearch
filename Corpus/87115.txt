 URL : "https://github.com/gbif/management-tools/issues/2" TITLE : ipt synchronisation state BODY : ipt installations expose an inventory http://labs.gbif.org:7007/inventory/dataset of their registered resources. this console should allow the user to enter the base url for an ipt or provide one in a link that calls the inventory, and then for each dataset lists the status in gbif coloured e.g. green for fully sync'ed or red for those needing attention. an example of how this might look, and what is useful to display is on the vertnet sync status console http://timrobertson100.github.io/vertnet-gbif-diagnostic/target/index.html . please note that is not using the ipt url but the concept is the same. please be aware of this ipt issue https://github.com/gbif/ipt/issues/1344 which means the inventory fails for ipts < v2.5 which use extensions. it would be helpful if the console reported to the user that due to ipt bug 1344 link this is not possible. please upgrade to the latest ipt to use this functionality .
