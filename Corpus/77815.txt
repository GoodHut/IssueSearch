 URL : "https://github.com/cite-architecture/ohco2/issues/97" TITLE : off by one in ngramhisto BODY : reproduce in sbt console load million.cex https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cite-architecture/citedx/master/libraries/million.cex into a repository. - get the textrepository. for this example, that is saved in val lib - get a copus of plutarch's pericles: val plut = lib.corpus ~~ ctsurn urn:cts:greeklit:tlg0007.tlg012: - ask for 1-grams occurring at least once: val ng = plut.ngramhisto 1,1,true - there are 903 of them: ng.size - look at the last one: ng.histogram 902 , which is res20: edu.holycross.shot.ohco2.stringcount = 2 ἡγεμονίαν so we're not getting them all. in citeapp, there is an _additional_ off-by-one somewhere that i'm still looking for. since citeapp shows the same list of results, but reports 904.
