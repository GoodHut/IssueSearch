BODY : how would i be dealing with plotting time-series data? i'm just trying to plot some dummy data using: double x = 1501572740 int y = 25 and then plot it using a thread that calls addentery2 in onresume like so: protected void onresume { super.onresume ; new thread new runnable { @override public void run { runonuithread new runnable { @override public void run { for int i = 0; i < 10; i++ { addentry2 ; } } } ; try { thread.sleep 600 ; } catch interruptedexception e { e.printstacktrace ; } } } .start ; } which then calls addentry2 : private void addentry2 { linedata data = chart.getdata ; if data != null { ilinedataset set = data.getdatasetbyindex 0 ; if set == null { set = createset ; data.adddataset set ; } log.d tag , addentry2: x + this.x ; log.d tag , addentry2: y + this.y ; data.addentry new entry float this.x, float this.y , 0 ; ++this.x; ++this.y; data.notifydatachanged ; log.d tag , addentry2: new x + this.x ; log.d tag , addentry2: new y + this.y ; chart.notifydatasetchanged ; chart.setvisiblexrangemaximum 120 ; chart.moveviewtox data.getentrycount ; } } now, the problem here is that it just plots one point and then nothing happens. but, if i reduce the number of digits in the timestamp, it works just fine but that won't help me. is there something that i'm missing out on? any way i can get around this? i'd appreciate some help here as i've been racking my brain for a long while with no results whatsoever. thanks in advance!
