 URL : "https://github.com/angular/material2/issues/6515" TITLE : tooltips - support html BODY : bug, feature request, or proposal: allow html in tooltips what is the expected behavior? tooltips allow html what is the current behavior? tooltips do not allow html what is the use-case or motivation for changing an existing behavior? basic functionality should someone want a bold tag or a line break in the tooltip. is there anything else we should know? most libraries support this functionality, there is currently no workaround but to use a different library. i'd really like to get the communities thoughts on this.
