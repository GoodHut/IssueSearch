 URL : "https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-try-config/issues/13" TITLE : adjust generated scenarios BODY : as mentioned in https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-try-config/pull/3 there are some situations where it would be useful to adjust the list of generated scenarios afterwards by e.g. adding or overwriting certain dependencies or even cloning generated scenarios. instead of implicitly generating the scenarios when useversioncompatibility is used i would suggest to explicitly require 'ember-try-config' and then put something like scenarios: generatescenarios in your config/ember-try.js file. that way the generatescenarios result could be written into a temporary variable if needed and then adjusted afterwards. /cc @rwjblue @kategengler
