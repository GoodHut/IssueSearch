 URL : "https://github.com/ProjectNami/ProjectNamiBlobCache/issues/7" TITLE : seeding cache for mobile BODY : i see in the code and observed in practice that mobile users are cached independently from desktop by adding |mobile to the url. however, i don't believe these |mobile users are cached by the seeing webjob. this means that the first mobile user doesn't ever hit the cache. should the webjob access each url twice?
