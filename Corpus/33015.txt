 URL : "https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore/issues/19359" TITLE : 3.3.5 security issue BODY : core 8fb6a3f411ca unfortunately somebody can access the server by bypassing the authentication system. he is able to access any existing account including gm accounts. he don't need the passwords. anyway the passwords are hashed. i have spoken with him ingame. he confirmed he is using a method between wow.exe and trinitycore. after proofing that he is able to do that i have checked the auth_account table. the sessionkey field is in all infiltrated accounts the same after he logged in. it is: ffff6666505044440d0d16165e5ea1a1f0f0cdcd4b4bc4c45c5cbcbc030351517c7cf2f22929e1e1 as you can see, the pattern in this sessionkey even looks strange ffff 6666 5050 4444. that's very unusual in such a key. the intruder is using a proxy server. so he ist coming with different ips from different countries. at the moment i have no change to block him.
