 URL : "https://github.com/Andrew67/ddr-finder-ng/issues/19" TITLE : ios status bar issues BODY : two issues with translucent status bar: - coming back from google maps, the app comes in as black instead of black-translucent , so now the content is pushed down. - coming back from sygic, it continues polling from location in the background, so again we have pushed-down content. - having a phone call active will also push down content. proposed fix: - function that adds/removes translucent-statusbar class from body, to have padding only on its presence. - call function on page load and on onresize events i've confirmed they fire .
