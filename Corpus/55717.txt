 URL : "https://github.com/kevinrutherford/dag/issues/11" TITLE : lenient cycle checking BODY : hey kevin -- thank you for releasing this package, it has made my life much easier. one of the things my co-founder and i noticed is that checking for cycles with every new edge becomes a significant performance issue as dags grow larger we could not build a graph with ~1,000 vertices and ~2,000 edges in a reasonable amount of time . i developed a tweak check out my fork where the user can choose to turn off cycle checking. then, whenever an edge is added, the dag shuts off and vertices and edges cannot be accessed until the user triggers a manual cycle checking. it's working for our purposes but the code is messy and there are no tests -- is this something you want to merge into the main fork? if yes, let me know and i'll clean it up.
