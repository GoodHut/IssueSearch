 URL : "https://github.com/kiibohd/controller/issues/183" TITLE : xt/at/ps2 scan modules BODY : so i'm wondering if anyone might have put in any effort into adding a scan module for legacy ibm compatible keyboards. i have some old xt model f's that i'd like to move to something more maintained than soarer's, and i think many people with model m's and other vintage at keyboards would love to have the flexibility of this controller at their disposal... so is this something that someone is already looking at / working on, or is it planned / considered? or was it considered and then dropped for some reason?
