 URL : "https://github.com/C-CINA/focus/issues/207" TITLE : hangs on process BODY : focus hangs on any process when a project folder is moved to a different location. however import works ok to the same folder. it is also possible to start the process manually e.g csh import_serialem.com from project_dir/auto/00000000002/proc; this works but not from the gui. in gui only first line import_serialem is shown in the log and then process hangs. mounting a bigger disk to a project folder where focus was running processes successfully before also causes the same problem. the disk i am trying focus to run on is raid ssd partition. what can i try to fix this issue?
