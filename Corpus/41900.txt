 URL : "https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack/issues/573" TITLE : add preset zoom sizes BODY : right now it's kinda hard to hit a round zoom percentage say, 125, 150, etc. ... this could be sorted by adding some preset zoom levels when right-clicking the zoom slider. additionally, the zoom slider should only use rounded values by default, and using .xx precision with a keyboard modifier.
