 URL : "https://github.com/nmvdw/Three-HITs/issues/5" TITLE : i am confused BODY : correct me if i am wrong, but aren't we doing the case of hit which can be factored out into an ordinary inductive type followed by a coequalizer? if not, what's a counter-example? our signature is finitary, so it ought to be the case that we can just do it this way. which begs the question: what is the paper about then?
