 URL : "https://github.com/bvaughn/react-select-fast-filter-options/issues/13" TITLE : ignoring too long strings? BODY : i am using this tool to search for groups of postal codes. the label string looks like this: wentorf bei hamburg 21465,22113,22145 you have to imagine that there are much more zip codes in the string if i enter the zip code directly it appears. if i enter the text prior to that it does not show. if i remove the fast filter options it all works as intended. do you know what could be a fix for this behaviour? thanks in advance.
