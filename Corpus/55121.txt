 URL : "https://github.com/geopython/pywps/issues/267" TITLE : implement user logging BODY : it would be nice to give the user the possibility to log process activity into the database. naturally, this would be far more interesting than just using the old text file. with sqlalchemy this would be a major improvement for the users debugging/tuning their processes. one of the ways to this would be to add a log method to the process class. another possibility is to pass an argument called logger to the _handler method.
