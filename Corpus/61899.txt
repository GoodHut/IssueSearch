 URL : "https://github.com/jeffdaily/parasail/issues/33" TITLE : building shared library BODY : hi, i'm looking to build a shared library for the application, and the instructions say to modify the line 'add_library parasail...' but i cannot find such a line anywhere in the installation. i see that the current version has a line that looks like 'add_library parasail ${lib_type}' in the cmakelists file. is there a way for me to specify the creation of a shared library? thanks! best, han
