 URL : "https://github.com/azerupi/mdBook/issues/356" TITLE : add a linkchecker BODY : a linkchecker is a convenient tool to have for avoiding errors and keeping track of dead links. it is also a nice to have for 308. the rbe linkchecker and the one used in rust-lang/rust https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/tools/linkchecker/main.rs both scan the files line-by-line while applying a regex to find links and check them. i don't know if it'd be ok for us to adopt the rust-lang/rust https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/tools/linkchecker/main.rs one? @steveklabnik i think a good place for this would be mdbook test .
