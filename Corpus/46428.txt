 URL : "https://github.com/adorsys/secure-storage-android/issues/23" TITLE : manifest merger error BODY : hi all, thanks for providing such an easy to use library. please note as i added your library i got this error when trying to build my app: error:execution failed for task ':app:processdebugmanifest'. > manifest merger failed : attribute application@allowbackup value= true from androidmanifest.xml:10:9-35 is also present at de.adorsys.android:securestoragelibrary:1.0.0 androidmanifest.xml:11:9-36 value= false . suggestion: add 'tools:replace= android:allowbackup ' to <application> element at androidmanifest.xml:8:5-31:19 to override. the workaround is to add what is suggested in the error above, however according to this article https://android.jlelse.eu/2-lines-in-manifest-to-remove-when-sharing-your-android-library-565d4c4af04a url it is probably a good idea to remove the 2 lines from the library so that this doesn't happen to new users of the lib. cheers and thanks again! g
