 URL : "https://github.com/sul-dlss/exhibits/issues/415" TITLE : create mirador widget BODY : create a widget that allows an exhibit creator to embed a mirador instance that displays a particular image, or image comparison set, and allows viewing of annotations for that image or comparison set. essentially, embed mirador on a feature page in a certain state. @blalbrit ps - should this be a sul-exhibits ticket or can this be a generic widget in spotlight?
