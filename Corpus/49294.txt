 URL : "https://github.com/terascope/teraslice/issues/534" TITLE : testing failure modes BODY : saw this pumba https://github.com/gaia-adm/pumba tool in my news feed and thought would be good to help test failure modes. to make this actionable, write an integration test that simulates a network partition between x & y. what x & y would be most valuable to test right now? slicer & cluster master? slicer & worker?
