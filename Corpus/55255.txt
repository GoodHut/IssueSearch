 URL : "https://github.com/rembo10/headphones/issues/2929" TITLE : incomplete artist data BODY : just posting here in case someone has any ideas. i noticed yesterday that artist data isn't complete in headphones. for example, mark wills is a country artist. he shows 6 albums in headphones, but if you open his musicbrainz profile he has a total of 8 albums. i noticed this across quite a few artists. - i have checked and duplicated this issue on 3 instances of headphones - refreshed artist - reinstalled headphones any ideas? i feel like this could by why i'm not finding a lot of my music as well.
