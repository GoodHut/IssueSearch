 URL : "https://github.com/ytti/oxidized/issues/829" TITLE : number of threads BODY : hi i have read the post https://github.com/ytti/oxidized/issues/457 about have threads are created and i think the idea is good. in my small test setup only one thread is created. if one or more device backup jobs hangs and waits for timeout x retries to proceed with the next backup job then it's not possible in oxidized web to do a reload for a node during this time. i don't know the best algorithm or if it's easy to fix, but i was thinking that if no matter how many threads that are in use - one extra free thread could be created for something like this? of course up the number of oxidized.config.threads cheers, martin
