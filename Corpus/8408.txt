 URL : "https://github.com/Flet/SublimeLinter-contrib-standard/issues/31" TITLE : not linting jsx BODY : i have sublime 3, the sublime linter, and the standard style guide installed of course. the linter works just fine on regular js files but, while i can successfully run the standard package against jsx files in the command line, this standard sublime linter doesn't seem to pick any of them up. i updated my user settings for it to include jsx: extensions : js , jsx . however, it's still not working.
