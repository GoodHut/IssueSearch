 URL : "https://github.com/GraceCovenantChurch/gccweb/issues/23" TITLE : website v1 design BODY : you can see what we currently have here: http://ec2-52-14-20-47.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8000/ / for version 1 of the website, we want to get off of the current old technology and move to something much easier to work with. @estheryjeon can you figure out the minimal design changes we need to make? i would like to get version 1 of the website done quickly, but at the same time, i don't want to sacrifice quality. we should try to make sure that the website is no worse than what we have at http://ucity.gracecovenant.net/ some things to start off with that pop out to me: - the main announcements that you see when you scroll down seem sort of incomplete. maybe it's because the pictures cut off in weird ways? or there's no padding between them? or there is a lack of structure small amount of text just kinda floating on top of the image ? to start off with, maybe we can just sketch out some prototype images of how you envision things to look in photoshop/illustrator or something and then post them in this issue.
