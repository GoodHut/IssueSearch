 URL : "https://github.com/Tmplt/bookwyrm/issues/9" TITLE : bundle termbox into lib/ BODY : termbox is currently an external dependency, a count of which i want to be 0 before first release. termbox build with waf which required python, so that isn't a problem we require it to build bookwyrm in the first place . either we submit some cmakelists.txt s upstream, or we do the simple task of executing waf from our own.
