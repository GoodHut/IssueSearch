 URL : "https://github.com/mauricius/vue-draggable-resizable/issues/15" TITLE : some advices and issues BODY : hello, i am from china so excuse me for any mistakes since my not-so-good english. i add a pseudo-class after class active just like this: .active:after { content: ; display: block; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-sizing: border-box; border: 1px dashed; } , i think it could be more clear when user is choosing an component and dragging it. the maximize function should be optional and i don't like it most of time because its animation is too long. the props of 'x' and 'y' have validator that must more than 0. that led to i can't drag it over the left or the top of its parent element even when i didn't set the 'parent' prop into true .is there any reason to do this ? i don't think it is a good idea. after all , this component is so great and i like it very much.
