 URL : "https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/issues/2365" TITLE : list + info BODY : i need to get list of backups, diff size for each snapshot at least for the last n snapshots plus size of all repo. i can do it now by borg list ... plus borg info ... for each line. this is not convenient at all. are there any better solutions? to me looks logical to add columns original size , deduplicated size to the output of borg list plus column size of repo all lines equal for easy parsing the output by scripts . borg -v borg 1.0.10
