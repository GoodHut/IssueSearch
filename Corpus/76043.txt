 URL : "https://github.com/pnkfelix/tango/issues/13" TITLE : inaccuracy in timestamps BODY : - timestamps set for files are losing nansecond level precision - timestamps seem to be getting muddled, with generated files being given an older time stamp steps to reproduce: 1 delete main.md, the project should only have main.rs 2 use tango to generate a new main.md file 3 check the time stamps of the files typing ls -l --full-time in the terminal to get them : -rw-rw-r-- 1 nasreen nasreen 3369 2017-09-01 13:42:18.651217000 +0100 main.md -rw-rw-r-- 1 nasreen nasreen 3357 2017-09-01 13:42:18.651217146 +0100 main.rs -rw-rw-r-- 1 nasreen nasreen 0 2017-09-01 13:42:18.651217000 +0100 tango.stamp this is strange because it seems like main.rs is younger! 4 delete main.md again, and regenerate it 5 check the timestamps again, they are still: -rw-rw-r-- 1 nasreen nasreen 3369 2017-09-01 13:42:18.651217000 +0100 main.md -rw-rw-r-- 1 nasreen nasreen 3357 2017-09-01 13:42:18.651217146 +0100 main.rs -rw-rw-r-- 1 nasreen nasreen 0 2017-09-01 13:42:18.651217000 +0100 tango.stamp this is strange because time has passed and they haven't changed
