 URL : "https://github.com/Icohedron/PersonalTime/issues/1" TITLE : integration with regions BODY : as suggested by diggynews https://forums.spongepowered.org/t/personal-time-allows-players-to-set-their-own-personal-time-of-day/19388/2?u=icohedron : > integrate personal time with regions from e.g. plotsquared/redprotect without giving the user access to /ptime > just the ptimes, so players would be able to set a specific ptime for their plot without the guest users having to use /ptime or even have access to it, as this is a rank perk on the freebuild worlds > e.g. halloween plots have night time, yet landscape plots have daytime, depending on the preference of the builder >entities would stay unaffected, as they cannot be summoned with my current configuration.
