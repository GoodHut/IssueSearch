 URL : "https://github.com/SatoshiKawabata/asm-dom-vs-virtual-dom/issues/1" TITLE : asm-dom c++ test BODY : hi, thank you for working on this repository, it is an interesting resource to measure asm-dom performance. it would be awesome if the same test will also be implemented directly in c++ using asm-dom cpp api https://github.com/mbasso/asm-dom/blob/master/docs/cpp.md , it would provide some interesting data about the overhead of the js <-> wasm bindings. are there plans to do that?
