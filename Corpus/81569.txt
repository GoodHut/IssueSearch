 URL : "https://github.com/LSSTDESC/Twinkles/issues/440" TITLE : 'u' band visits in year 1 BODY : there was a decision to build templates of twinkles run 1.3 visits from year 1. it has been reported by @simonkrughoff ? that during year 1, twinkles run 1.3 has no visits in 'u' band, which would mean we cannot do u band difference images. however, checking on minion_1016 for field 1427, we find that there are many 484 'u' band visits as for some reason u band tends to be extremely populous in deep drilling fields, 2nd highest visited band here . we need to understand what caused this difference, for example if all of the u band visits ended up on the list of long jobs, that we did not do.
