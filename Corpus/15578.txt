 URL : "https://github.com/pablobarbera/Rfacebook/issues/131" TITLE : error with httpuv BODY : i used rfacebook about two months ago and had no problem, but now when i go to download and run rfacebook, i get an error. install.packages rfacebook works fine. but when i run library rfacebook i get the error: package 'httpuv' could not be loaded after that, no part of rfacebook fboauth, getusers etc will work. if i try to install httpuv separately, it will again install fine but then error when i run library httpuv . error: package or namespace load failed for ‘httpuv’ any ideas what changed since the last time i ran this fine? thanks in advance!
