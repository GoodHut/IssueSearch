 URL : "https://github.com/jonnystorm/snmp-elixir/issues/6" TITLE : snmpv3 usm support BODY : the biggest hurdle right now is usm engineid discovery, which effectively does not exist in otp. in erlang/otp master, :snmpm.discovery is commented out https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/master/lib/snmp/src/manager/snmpm.erl l469 , with calls pointing to :snmpm_server which contains no implementation. it isn't yet clear to me whether code in :snmpa.discovery https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/master/lib/snmp/src/agent/snmpa.erl l772 could be useful, but that's likely the closest thing otp has.
