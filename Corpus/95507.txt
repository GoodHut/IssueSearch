 URL : "https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/30170" TITLE : ddc doesn't support bigint BODY : tracking issue for migrating tests for bigint and the web. @jcollins-g: does ddc+chrome even support bigints at all in dart? the test failures i'm getting migrating big_integer_arith_vm_test.dart suggest it doesn't once i fixed the static compilation problems @munificent nope. that test is probably marked fail or skip on ddc and will continue to be. there is likely a separate migration/clean-up we should do later to reconcile how we handle big int tests and the web. right now, number semantics for the web are completely untested !
