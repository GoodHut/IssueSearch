 URL : "https://github.com/joeyespo/grip/issues/226" TITLE : multiple input files BODY : hi, i am writing a book using gfm, and i wish to print it to pdf in my web browser. this may seem a duplicate of 88, but what i need is all rendered markdown content in one web page. for this, the command line usage should change from: grip options <path> <address> to: grip options -- <paths> and one more option, --listen=<host> :<port> , should be added. i tried to get it work by myself in my fork, but it's too hard for me. if this is a good suggestion for grip, can anyone help me how to do it?
