 URL : "https://github.com/singer-io/tap-marketo/issues/11" TITLE : too much data BODY : a good 50% of the output that tap-marketo produces are activities of type=13 , change data value . these are not really useful to us - they're just a cue to reload the associated lead which tap-marketo is already doing, there's no need to emit the activity as well. could you change tap-marketo to not emit activities with type=13 but still load them from marketo and update the lead ?
