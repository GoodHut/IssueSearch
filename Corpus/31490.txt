 URL : "https://github.com/johnae/spook/issues/29" TITLE : slim down main.moon BODY : there's been a proliferation of things that have gone into main.moon where they arguably don't belong. i think especially the event coalescing should really be somewhere else. it might be interesting at some point to further explore behavior based on program name as in this https://github.com/johnae/spook/pull/28. it's not exactly related to cleaning up main.moon but it is certainly in main.moon that the decision would be taken on what identity to assume.
