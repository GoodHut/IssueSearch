 URL : "https://github.com/graphql-erlang/graphql/issues/46" TITLE : graphql on the beam BODY : hey! i'm one of the authors of https://github.com/absinthe-graphql/absinthe, and am very excited to see interest in graphql within erlang as well. i'm curious to know what has prompted you to develop your own implementation instead of using absinthe. is it purely a desire to not need an elixir dependency? does absinthe seem very difficult to use from erlang? did you simply want to take on the challenge?
