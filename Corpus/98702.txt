 URL : "https://github.com/hyperapp/hyperapp/issues/300" TITLE : keyed benchmark comparison BODY : are there any reasons why hyperapp is only mentioned in the non-keyed section of the referred benchmark in the documentation? it seems hyperapp already supports keyed reconciliation. is it complicated to update the benchmarks to include hyperapp in the keyed comparison table as well? https://rawgit.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark/master/webdriver-ts-results/table.html
