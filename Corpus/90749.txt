 URL : "https://github.com/championswimmer/vuex-persist/issues/13" TITLE : state not being restored. BODY : i have a list of objects that is stored in vuex. i have setup vuex-persist as instructed but on startup, it doesn't auto restore the state. i have an action that is run every time the app is started, this action fetches data based on a variable that should be persisted with vuex-persist. loadjobs: function { commit } { axios { method: 'get', url: 'http://localhost:9000/document/jobs', headers: {'x-bb-session': 'ce756dff-d572-4a8c-a4a8-c62b0eef0d32'}, params: { where: 'timeposted > ' + this.state.lastupdate //this should have persisted value, page: 0, recordsperpage: 50 } } .then response => { if response.data.data.length > 0 { console.log this.state.lastupdate // weirdly has the persisted value here commit 'setjobs', { list: response.data.data } } commit 'setlastupdatetime', math.floor date.now / 1000 ; } .catch error => { console.log error } } inside the response callback of the axios request, this.state.lastupdate seems to have the right persisted value. other state attributes have this behavior as well. any help will be appreciated. i feel as if i am missing something obvious here
