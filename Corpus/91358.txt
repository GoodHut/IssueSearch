 URL : "https://github.com/luapower/thread/issues/6" TITLE : thread join waits forever BODY : i am on windows 8, running luajit32. installed the required libraries manually under luarocks to run high level thread.lua pthread, lustate, time, glue etc . the first time test_queue method is called as test_queue 1000, 10, 1000, 10, 1000 in thread_test.lua, the second call on pt:join line 116 blocks the call indefinitely hence the application does not terminate. i am using eclipse as my ide and am wondering if there is anything i can do to diagnose the issue. thanks, mehmet
