 URL : "https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-js/issues/119" TITLE : checkarraytypes is fragile BODY : checkarraytypes uses the following hack to determine if an object is an uint8array: object.prototype.tostring.call thing !== ' object uint8array ' this breaks if someone installs a new tostring method in the object prototype which one might want to do to assist in debugging . a more reliable way to check whether an object is of a particular type is to look at its constructor, i.e.: thing.constructor == uint8array
