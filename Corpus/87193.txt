 URL : "https://github.com/khcnz/Espressif2Arduino/issues/5" TITLE : issues when flashing rom3 BODY : as raised in https://github.com/mirko/sonota/issues/11 i think i know what may be wrong - i was testing a slightly different configuration and noticed that sometimes the buffer downloading the new images doesn't fill up - and when it doesn't fill up in multiples of 4 bytes bad things happen the flash doesn't write correctly . i have a fix in the works but for now you will have to flash it with serial cable sorry.
