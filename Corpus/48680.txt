 URL : "https://github.com/AjuntamentdeBarcelona/decidim/issues/554" TITLE : show loading comments BODY : :tophat: user story currently, when comments are loading, we show their count, just to replace it with the real count afterwards. this is confusing for the users, as a resource with comments might appear as it had no comments on an unstable / slow connection. we should add some kind of indicator when comments are loading. i suggest replacing the comments count header for loading comments... while we work on a better ui abstraction. :clipboard: related documentation none :dart: acceptance criteria user can figure out wether comments are loading or already loaded. :pushpin: related issues none
