 URL : "https://github.com/gkz/LiveScript/issues/945" TITLE : multiline if expressions BODY : this code: livescript positioning = if ev.altkey then 'above' else if annot.some -> it is /above/ then 'above' else if annot.some -> it is /below/ then 'below' compiles neatly into ?: like this: javascript positioning = ev.altkey ? 'above' : annot.some function it { return /above/.exec it ; } ? 'above' : annot.some function it { return /below/.exec it ; } ? 'below' : void 8; however this slightly modified version: livescript positioning = if ev.altkey then 'above' else if annot.some -> it is /above/ then 'above' else if annot.some -> it is /below/ then 'below' produces a somewhat unexpected result. javascript positioning = ev.altkey ? 'above' : annot.some function it { return /above/.exec it ; } ? 'above' : void 8, annot.some function it { return /below/.exec it ; } ? 'below' : void 8 ; notice the two void 8 s and the comma. honestly i was expecting the latter to not even compile, but since it does, the result looks very unexpected. it seems like empty else clauses at the end of the line are treated as returning void . imho they should either be rejected as a syntax error or the expression should be expected to appear on the next line.
