 URL : "https://github.com/NREL/SAM/issues/26" TITLE : linux build improvements BODY : currently the linux build requires a folder hierarchy looking like: /workspace /workspace/lk /workspace/wex /workspace/ssc /workspace/sam /workspace/googletest the linux build can be improved in the following ways: 1. require the assignment the following as environment variables: lkdir - /path/to/lk wexdir - /path/to/wex sscdir - /path/to/ssc samntdir - /path/to/sam gtest - /path/to/googletest 2. update the linux makefiles to use these environment variables rather than forcing a specific folder hierarchy.
