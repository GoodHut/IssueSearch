BODY : i'm looking at the sample filetimepropertypage and in there is a propertypage .cs file with its subordinate resx and designer files etc. but how was that added to the project? i'm creating a new class library project like that shown in filetimepropertysheet.cs but cannot understand how you added the property page to the project. it's been a while since i did any windows forms - so i may just be rusty! thx
