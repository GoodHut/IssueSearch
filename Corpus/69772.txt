 URL : "https://github.com/chrmarti/testissues/issues/621" TITLE : turn off format on save BODY : i've turned off any formatonsave settings but vscode continues to format on save. this is throwing off my commits and other devs on my team are seeing formatting changes that sometimes will break eslint. please fix this. i've followed every possible set of directions to disable formatonsave but nothing seems to be working. this is incredibly frustrating. i stopped using atom because vscode is much faster, but i'm rethinking and might go to webstorm or rubymine because of this. - vscode version: 1.13.1 - os version: macos 10.12.4
