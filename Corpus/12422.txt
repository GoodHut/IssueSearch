 URL : "https://github.com/Keyang/node-csvtojson/issues/135" TITLE : pausing a stream BODY : pausing a stream doesn't seem to have an effect - the parser proceeds reading the csv as usual. take for example the following code: javascript const rs = fs.createreadstream this.csvpath ; rs.pause ; let count = 0; csv .fromstream rs .on json , json => { count++; console.log count ; } .on done , => { cb null, count ; } .on error , err => { cb err ; } count is logged 200 times that's how many rows i have in my csv - i was expecting it not to do anything since the stream is paused before passing it over to fromstream
