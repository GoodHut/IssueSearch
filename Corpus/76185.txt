 URL : "https://github.com/gabordemooij/redbean/issues/552" TITLE : installation - no rb.php BODY : hi, i really enjoy using redbean. i have a set up right now where we are using this, but for some reason i was told to try to get a php package from github. here i followed the instructions and went over to the http://www.redbeanphp.com/index.php?p=/install website. there it states that there should be a rb.php file to include. even in the rb-p533.php file it is trying to open that. where is this file and what is it that i am misunderstanding. sorry if it's something stupid! thanks
