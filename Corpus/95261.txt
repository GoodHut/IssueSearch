 URL : "https://github.com/ckrack/hydrometer-public-server/issues/6" TITLE : create gravity calibration BODY : support for a calibration based on submitted data would be great. much like here: https://universam1.github.io/ispindel/tools/calibration/calibration.htm but based on actual data-points. scenario: select data-points in the list. define the measured value for them in a textinput. these points will be saved to the database calibrations_points id, datapoint_id, correct_value . the calibration is saved as polynomial values in it's own table calibrations .
