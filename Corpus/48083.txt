 URL : "https://github.com/azerupi/mdBook/issues/290" TITLE : release process stuff BODY : @azerupi ; i just cut 0.0.22 for @dtolnay and the cookbook; they had several fixes they wanted to get out. that's when i noticed you had it as 0.0.22-pre; now that it's not just you that can do releases, we should talk about stuff like how version should be in cargo.toml do we push tags, and if so, what format etc /cc @frewsxcv
