 URL : "https://github.com/core-wg/resource-directory/issues/13" TITLE : uniqueness scope for ins BODY : within which scope should the ins parameter be unique? the -09 draft and the restoration pr 11 demands that it should be unique across all resources with the same rt and d . that is hard for the individual device to support out of the box short of adding its serial number to everything, and given it's not a must still insufficient for an rd exporter eg. to dns-sd to use. in the last meeting, labels for distinguishing two instances in a combined devices came up two fridge compartments, ins= upper and ins= lower , which would violate that constraint when two fridges are present in one domain. i'd suggest to either relax the uniqueness requirements and have whoever exports this to dns-sd deal with the resulting ambiguities 1 , or make them strict enough for ins= conflicts to fail early an absent ins= would be such a conflict too, or is that a free pass to construct an ins at will? , and suggest a different mechanism for upper / lower distinctions title? . 1 : for example, as is done in the z-wave-ip, see design specification 4.1.2.3: if several end point name and end point location entries are identical, the z/ip rd must auto-append unique data to each of the conflicting end point names
