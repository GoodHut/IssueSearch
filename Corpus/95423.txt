 URL : "https://github.com/Sage/streamlinejs/issues/363" TITLE : cut support for node < 4.0 BODY : travis-ci build hangs on node 0.12 but strangely works on node 0.10 . node 0.12 is now end of life so i'm bumping the minimal node version to 4.0. note: streamline may still work on older node versions, and you will only get a warning during install, but i won't be supporting it on versions < 4.0.
