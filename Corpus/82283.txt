 URL : "https://github.com/f500/elewant/issues/66" TITLE : add relocate herd command BODY : a herd does not have a location. in order to show herds on a map, we want to add a lat/long to a herd's properties. the relocate herd command can be run for all existing users by making a console command that takes the country input from twitter and transforms that into lat/long. after that, we should have a user-interface for changing the location of your herd, preferably on a map resulting in lat/long coordinates . a cool idea: for any herds that we don't have a location for, just show them on a random place on the map with a question mark and a message to the user your herd is lost... help guiding them home!
