 URL : "https://github.com/BenjaminEHowe/keyringpi-gen/issues/2" TITLE : create -vnc release BODY : this should being up realvnc https://www.realvnc.com/docs/raspberry-pi.html on boot, so that the user can plug their pi zero in and simply vnc directly - i don't think cloud connections are smart enough to work to my.keyringpi.com. obviously this means that a full jessie install is required - with desktop etc. the vnc release should also support ssh but obviously is suboptimal for use in this way, as a full desktop environment will be loaded and using the limited resources of the pi zero . should vnc use encryption? while encryption is nearly always good, it'll unduly direct connection over a microusb cable tax the bcm2385. what screen resolution should we use? see the realvnc docs https://www.realvnc.com/docs/raspberry-pi.html raspberry-pi-troubleshoot for more thoughts along these lines.
