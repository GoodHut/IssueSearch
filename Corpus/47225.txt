 URL : "https://github.com/osx-cross/homebrew-avr/issues/48" TITLE : older versions of gcc BODY : as of today, we have 3 versions of gcc: - latest 6.3.0 - 4.9 - 4.8 we don't have 5.x. i'm wondering if we should have them all, or none at all. doesn't really make sense to jump from 4 to 6. in hombrew they have all the versions from 4.6 to 5. my opinion would be to keep only the latest version of each big version: - 4.x - 5.x - 6.x - etc. but don't bother with multiple versions of each. and regarding binutils and avr-libc, only keep the latest version. if they are not compatible with older version of gcc, drop support of those versions of gcc. what do you thing?
