 URL : "https://github.com/Awful/Awful.app/issues/448" TITLE : avatar history browser BODY : > i believe it grabs the current av url and backtracks based on that; that's why soap won't show avs that are mod-given like the big byob ones because those are hosted elsewhere on the server and therefore outside the normal sa avatar schema. http://muddledmuse.com/saars/ and http://esarahpalinonline.com/soap/ are relevant services.
