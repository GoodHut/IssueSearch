 URL : "https://github.com/KartikTalwar/gmail.js/issues/370" TITLE : link to draft? BODY : is it possible to create a link to a draft? the message and thread ids seem to be volatile and change when you open or alter a draft. the draft id seems to be the immutable identifier of a draft, and regardless of how many times you open it returns the same value. i'm wondering if there is a way to convert this id to a link to that draft. it's possible to use the thread or message id and tack on a compose=<thread/message id> but since that id is transient that link will only work once.
