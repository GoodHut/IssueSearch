 URL : "https://github.com/ExtendScript/extendscript-es5-shim/issues/7" TITLE : publish as npm package? BODY : can this repo be published as an npm package? i'm rewriting my after effects package https://www.npmjs.com/package/after-effects which involves an es5 shim, and i'd like to reference this one. i could also publish it myself, and point it toward this repo, if there are no objections.
