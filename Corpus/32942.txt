 URL : "https://github.com/vitiral/artifact/issues/149" TITLE : 1.0: add server uuid BODY : right now if you close/reopen the server and try to save it will give all sorts of weird errors... because artifact-ids no longer correspond to the artifact-names! this is because artifact-id is random as it should be . this should be detected and an alert should be raised requesting complete reload.
