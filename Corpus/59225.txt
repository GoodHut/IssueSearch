 URL : "https://github.com/artem-solovev/artfolio/issues/82" TITLE : ticket - functions.php BODY : - as a end user we'll add the whole image url with http:// or https:// . so, your code http://' . esc_attr $slidereadmorelink is not valid. if you still want this then add the related not in customizer setting field. @see https://qsnapnet.com/snaps/qm5yga5xihp5vcx - also, set slider default on. so, it looks like your theme screenshot after initial setup. - make strings translation ready. e.g. string read more is not translation ready. - avoid prefixes for 3rd party assets. e.g. use fontawesome instead of artfolio-fontawesome - you need to provide the unminified version of your theme assets. e.g. you used camera.min.js so you need to provide the camera.js. - remove wp_default_scripts which is plugin territory. note: i noticed that @rabmalin already suggested this issue in your last ticket too. @see https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33947 - mentor notes: - is this valid to use google fonts in add_editor_style ? not found any reference regarding this.
