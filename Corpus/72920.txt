 URL : "https://github.com/SkygearIO/features/issues/131" TITLE : clarify admin role usage BODY : description in skygear, there is a special role called admin . in skygear docs https://docs.skygear.io/guides/cloud-db/acl-overview/js/ , it was said to be: > what only admin role can do: > assign role to user > revoke role to user however, admin role seems also able to override acl as it was used in skygear cms. i think we should clearly define the permission of admin role and shall break it down. from what i understand now, it seems there is at least several permission: assign roles, from roles to users revoke roles, from roles to users access all public db access all private db change all user passwords in short term, we should at least clarify what is an admin role, so users don't accidentally open unnecessary access to all users. maybe have a few sub-roles to allow finer acl. a 2.0 idea is simply switch to policy based acl for these... @rickmak please chips in if i misunderstood anything. the above was based on a discussion with @limouren on cms permissions.
