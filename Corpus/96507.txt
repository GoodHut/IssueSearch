 URL : "https://github.com/cnguy/kayn/issues/40" TITLE : experimental api additions BODY : this is tbd, but i'm thinking of adding additional helpers that may help the library be a lot easier to use. the base api will remain untouched . i'm simply just adding some helpers to that if useful for my lol project, would probably be useful for other projects as well. this idea is kinda based off of cassiopeia https://github.com/meraki-analytics/cassiopeia/blob/master/examples/summoner.py where there are ghost objects that represent what you want, but in this case it'll be asynchronous because of async/await and promises. i'm going to see if this api works well on one of my other hobby projects before i work on it further though. i'm not going to abstract everything in the api since that's a headache, but i think that having a lot of helpers for specifically the summoner response would be useful since it's used in every other endpoint. javascript const summoner = rhaast kayn .summoner; const main = async => { // a shell that simply has a name property and helper functions. const summoner = summoner { name: 'contractz' } ; // summoner.name = 'contractz'; // summoner.region = summoner args, region or kayn's default region; // the actual summoner object by riot api. const fullsummoner = await summoner.get ; / { name: 'contractz', id: 32932398, accountid: 47776491, region: 'na', profileiconid: 3155, revisiondate: 1512621047000, summonerlevel: 30 } / // getting the matchlist with the same summoner helper above. : // notice how you're able to call this without any mention of the account id. const matchlist = await summoner.matchlist ; }; main ;
