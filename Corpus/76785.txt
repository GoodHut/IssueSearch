 URL : "https://github.com/stasson/vue-mdc-adapter/issues/134" TITLE : make components reactive BODY : as was discussed in 111, there are some component properties that should be reactive and are not. we should identify them here and discuss the correct way to implement the reactive functionality. we should interact with the foundation where appropriate. - mdc-button - mdc-card - mdc-dialog - mdc-drawer-list - mdc-fab - mdc-grid-list - mdc-icon-toggle - mdc-linear-progress - mdc-list-divider - mdc-list - mdc-menu - mdc-radio - mdc-slider - mdc-snackbar - mdc-switch - mdc-tab-bar - mdc-textfield - mdc-toolbar-section - mdc-toolbar this list is very inclusive. these are only the components that are worth investigating, not necessarily those that need changes.
