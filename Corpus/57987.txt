 URL : "https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/issues/2089" TITLE : resumable file uploads BODY : some commits may contain very large files. if pachd or the storage pachyderm uses becomes unavailable we'd want to retry the commit from where it failed. tus is a protocol for resumable file uploads over http. it provides an abstraction for filesystems which we can use to provide access to pfs. this is the reference server implementation: https://github.com/tus/tusd i think we can run it in pachd without a problem.
