 URL : "https://github.com/opencollab/jlatexmath/issues/12" TITLE : maven build progress BODY : hi @calixteman asked that i proceed with the refactor to use maven as a build tool as discussed in 6. i have a fork at https://github.com/davidmoten/jlatexmath that is looking good and i'll submit it as a pr soon. as preparatory work with @calixteman's permission i've removed the recent commit d7d9456299771be733cf337ed3e7ba2a96ffc64b massive reindent to simplify the work on the pr. the state of the master branch before the commit removal is at the branch https://github.com/opencollab/jlatexmath/tree/before-massive-indent-removal. i'll submit the maven rework as a pr so that people have some visibility and chance to comment. merge will be pretty soon after i imagine as we can then deal with any minor issues on master than on the pr.
