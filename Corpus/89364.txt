 URL : "https://github.com/FrogSquare/GodotFireBase/issues/12" TITLE : proper bundle value types BODY : hi there, i don't know if this is useful, because i have seen you can configure firebase to treat values as either text or numbers, but here i have implemented some type detection to use proper bundle methods such as putdouble , putinteger , putboolean , putstring , based on dictionary value types. https://github.com/nanbustudio/godotfirebase/commit/6a5ba7af4914c7385d2ffb102376b151d099b080 let me know if you find this useful to include in the main godotfirebase repository. as i said, i still don't know if this modifies the way firebase perceives the given values.
