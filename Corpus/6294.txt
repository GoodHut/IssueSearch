 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/39253" TITLE : about the theme BODY : - vscode version: code 1.18.1 929bacba01ef658b873545e26034d1a8067445e9, 2017-11-16t18:32:36.023z - os version: windows_nt x64 10.0.16299 - extensions: none --- the title bar and the menu bar are not very fit with the theme. for example, in visual studio, when i use the dark theme, the title bar and the menu bar are dark, too, while in vs code, they are not. hope it could be improved, for i think vs code is almost perfect.
