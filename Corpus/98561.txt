 URL : "https://github.com/api-platform/core/issues/1064" TITLE : issue with fosuserbundle 2 BODY : i'm still investigating the issue, but just wanted to mention it here so long, in case someone else has come across this. i'm building a new api with fosuserbundle 2, and the issue that i'm experiencing is that my user passwords are never hashed upon save. this is due to the usermanager::updateuser method never being called. what i've found so far, in apiplatform\core\bridge\fosuser\eventlistener l49 https://github.com/api-platform/core/blob/master/src/bridge/fosuser/eventlistener.php l49 , when dumping the result of the $event->getcontrollerresult call, i actually get a json string instead of the user object: string 89 { id : 1bc3b33a9d3b1e09 , email : foo@bars12.com , fullname :null, username : foobars12 } the next line then checks $user instanceof userinterface , and returns if it's false, which means the switch is never reached below to call the updateuser method.
