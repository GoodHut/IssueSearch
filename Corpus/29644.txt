 URL : "https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper/issues/288" TITLE : menu not accessible BODY : some issues: - no focus style - a link is used as the button, producing the wrong role for screen reader users and since the link doesn't point anywhere, it doesn't behave like a link either - the state open / closed is not communicated - focus is not moved to the menu when it is opened, meaning it is not reachable by keyboard. suggested html elided : html <button aria-expanded= false > <span class= word >menu</span> </button> _ note that aria-expanded should be switched to true on opening the menu _. so that the menu is reachable by keyboard, focus should be applied to the first of the menu items on opening the menu. when pressing the close button, the menu button should be refocused using focus .
