 URL : "https://github.com/anttiviljami/wp-libre-form/issues/50" TITLE : fallback on no-js BODY : right now forms isn't working if used does not have javascript enabled. yes, every website relies on js but i think when speaking about forms, it's quite important to have fallback. we could just set form method to post, but that causes quite possibly conflict with post variable names since wordpress uses internally example name full list of reserved variable names here http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/77337/page-returns-404-with-post-variables-but-not-without . one option is to prefix every input in code, so that user can just input name= name in editor and it changes to name= wplf_name . but i'm not sure if this is the way to go, because it's not that pretty, causes a lot of code changes and possibly breaks custom form handling made by user. other option is use get method, but then you can't send files and for pretty urls we need to handle form and make a redirect after that without any parameters. and there's also a small problem with how and when to indicate success, using get parameter isn't a option because then user sends that url to friend... yes, post parameter is answer. but we need also think form validation and validation error messages. yrgh :/
