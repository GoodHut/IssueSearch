 URL : "https://github.com/servocoder/RichFilemanager/issues/180" TITLE : download: keep folder name BODY : this could be an enhancement: - it would be usefull to download a folder keeping the original folder name , so we can locate the correct _zip_ file in our downloads folder. my suggestion is to _ rename _ the resulting zip file using this format: folder_name-timestamp.zip and maybe normalize folder_name removing all non-alphanumeric chars including spaces and other symbols keeping just the numbers, letters, underscores and hyphens. regards.
