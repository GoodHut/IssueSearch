 URL : "https://github.com/n7a235/service.routing/issues/30" TITLE : improve generative testing BODY : currently the generative testing only checks that the result is the same for consecutive executions. some other cases come to my mind: - given the same input, the algorithm should return exactly the same output - the distance between the source and any destination should never be less than zero - the distance between the source and itself should always be zero - if the source is the same as the destination the algorithm should only explore the source node, i.e. stop immediately since the answer is trivial
