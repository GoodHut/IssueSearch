 URL : "https://github.com/mapd/mapd-core/issues/86" TITLE : the rowid column BODY : what is actual function of the special column 'rowid'? the column looks like a positional index of a table as seen in other databases. i did a test. with the table schema and 172m-row data set https://github.com/mapd/mapd-core/issues/85 , the response time of query > select medallion from trips where rowid = 9999999; and query > select hack_license from trips where medallion = '14f326693541402c4d10579ea55bf69b' limit 1; are pretty close took ~1 sec . i had expected the first query to be much faster, because the rowid 9999999 might be used to directly fetch the value of a column from a data file vs. loading all values of the column into memory but it seems not. correct? my point of this test is if the rowid can be used to random access a data file and every insert of a row can return rowid of the row to mapdsql, by augmenting mapdsql with some sql parsing functions and a key-value store, it is possible to add indexing function to mapd without significant changes to mapd server core...
