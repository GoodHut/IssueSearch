 URL : "https://github.com/actions-on-google/actionssdk-smart-home-nodejs/issues/68" TITLE : cannot get / or /login BODY : in the setup instruction step 9 if we follow the instruction and use node smart-home-provider-cloud.js islocal command when the current path is smart-home-provider/cloud, the localhost:3000 or ngrok url is 404, since the node_module is in smart-home-provider folder. instead of using node smart-home-provider-cloud.js islocal command, we should input node cloud/smart-home-provider-cloud.js islocal , then we can access the login page. although this is a very small issue, since i am not familiar with nodejs, it took me 2 days to find the solution.
