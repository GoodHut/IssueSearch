 URL : "https://github.com/borisveytsman/acmart/issues/70" TITLE : documentation for \thanks BODY : the example given for \thanks is a bit confusing because it contains the address of the authors, while those should be given in \affiliation. perhaps just the grant information is sufficient in the example, although grant information must also be given in the \ack, using \grantsponsor and \grantnum.
