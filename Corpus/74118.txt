 URL : "https://github.com/ODataOrg/home-samples/issues/11" TITLE : double quote replacement BODY : i'm just reading through the guide understand odata in 6 steps http://www.odata.org/getting-started/understand-odata-in-6-steps/ and noticed the node.js code was broken. js geturl serviceroot + 'people 'russellwhyte' ' ; the md files in this repo seem to look fine: js geturl serviceroot + people 'russellwhyte' ; i'm not sure how the md files are rendered to the website, but the change from double to single quotes has a significant impact on this particular line of code.
