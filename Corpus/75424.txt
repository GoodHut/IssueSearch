 URL : "https://github.com/particl/partgui/issues/540" TITLE : help/support page needed BODY : as i was introducing the wallet to a few newcomers even newcomers to all crypto , their all questions made me think that we don't really explain much of the features included in the wallet. the questions were along the topics of: - why do i have multiple balances and what's the difference there? - why there are multiple levels of unlocking the wallet? - etc. this is all written on the wiki for example, but there's not any option how to get there from the wallet. many of those are touched upon in the small help paragraphs below the features, but there's just so much you can explain on such small space. i think that separate section, for now maybe in the main navigation itself, later probably in the multiwallet sidebar next to feedback, donate & settings buttons should be created, containing some basics and links to: - wiki - support channels on riot/slack/whatever - social links because why not?
