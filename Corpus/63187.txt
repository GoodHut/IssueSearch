 URL : "https://github.com/myint/pyflakes-test/issues/5" TITLE : detect misuse of except BODY : it would be nice if pyflakes could detect mistakes like this: try: oldtime = os.path.getmtime fname except oserror, ioerror: oldtime = 0 in the general case, it's obviously difficult to tell whether this is an error or not; but i suspect that handling the exception variable name as a binding would give you a redefinition of foo warning in most of the cases where a mistake has been made.
