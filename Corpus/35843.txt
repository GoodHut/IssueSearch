 URL : "https://github.com/zapadi/redmine-net-api/issues/192" TITLE : file upload is buggy BODY : there's a bug. file-uploading doesn't work. you need to pass the filename as url-parameter in getuploadfileurl. to url-encode, you need to add a reference to system.web. in file redmine-net20-api/internals/urlhelper.cs afterwards, you need to change 2 or 3 functions, to include the filename parameter. /// <summary> /// gets the upload file url. /// </summary> /// <param name= redminemanager >the redmine manager.</param> /// <returns></returns> public static string getuploadfileurl redminemanager redminemanager, string filename { filename = system.web.httputility.urlencode filename ; return string.format format, redminemanager.host, redminekeys.uploads, redminemanager.mimeformat.tostring .tolower + ?filename= + filename; } also, in redminemanager.cs, subsequently already include the filename in the upload-info: public upload uploadfile byte data, string filename { var url = urlhelper.getuploadfileurl this, filename ; upload u = webapihelper.executeuploadfile this, url, data, uploadfile ; u.filename = filename; return u; }
