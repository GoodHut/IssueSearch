 URL : "https://github.com/cmu-db/peloton/issues/819" TITLE : add support for enum type BODY : we need support for enum types for our workload samples. we could do it the mysql way where the enum list is dedicate to the specific table, but i would prefer to keep with following postgres and maintain it as a new type in the catalog: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/datatype-enum.html to do this, this means that we need to start adding preliminary support for user-defined types. we need to add pg_type and pg_enum catalog tables: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/catalog-pg-type.html https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/catalog-pg-enum.html after thinking about it for a bit, i suspect that this is going to be a major overhaul. it is going to require a changes in the binder, llvm engine, and storage layer to be able to reference pg_enum . note also that pg_type is going to need support for array types 627 .
