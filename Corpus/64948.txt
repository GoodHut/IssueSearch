 URL : "https://github.com/susannaelsie/stat545-hw-klassen-susanna/issues/4" TITLE : hw 05 ready for grading BODY : peer review: - hope you don't mind me creating this issue. - the section titles are nice and clear to read. - the color palette looks very beautiful! not sure if you noticed the title of the plot in 1.2.2 is cut. you can maybe try in theme to make the title in two lines. - not sure why after reordering the number of levels increases to 7? - did you try if writing into csv would preserve the reordered levels? - at the time of this peer review, sections 3 and 4 are not done yet. just to indicate that i couldn't see the whole homework yet - thanks for sharing the links, they seem to be very useful. - you can add more descriptions of each homework in the main readme. and link to hw05 is currently missing.
