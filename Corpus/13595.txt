BODY : this project worked great on my vizio tv, thank you! any plans to add support for the vizio crave 360 speaker? i attempted the pairing process and its slightly different. when you initiate pairing with the speaker it makes an audible tone that you acknowledge by tapping the speaker same way the smartcast app is paired . your tool still gave a challenge token and referred to it as challenge type: 7 . however with no pin for the cli tool the pairing process was not able to complete.
