 URL : "https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-ce/issues/132" TITLE : phaser keyboard lastchar BODY : hello there! i'm having the issue, that i can not access lastchar before any key has been pressed. i always get the following error: phaser.js:44758 uncaught typeerror: cannot read property 'charcode' of null if i press a key very quick before the game starts it works because lastchar seems not to be undefined. i guess in this part lies the error: object.defineproperty phaser.keyboard.prototype, lastchar , { get: function { if this.event.charcode === '32' { return ''; } else { return string.fromcharcode this.pressevent.charcode ; } } } ;
