 URL : "https://github.com/ellmetha/django-precise-bbcode/issues/17" TITLE : parsing bbcode to list BODY : i didn't see it in documentation, so i thought maybe this feature does not exist. is there a way to parse bbcode to a list from a string? considering a custom tag as a : text = lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, a consectetur /a adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod a tempor /a incididunt ut labore a et /a dolore magna aliqua. parser a , text consectetur , tempor , et why do i need it? or why would someone else need it? in a basic blog, where titles are for an unknown reason implemented as a different model not a field called as title . i want to get value of a tag and filter a queryset based on that value. considering the former example: title.objects.filter label= consectetur is it possible yet? thanks in advance.
