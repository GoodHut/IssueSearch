 URL : "https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/1235" TITLE : unknown host exception BODY : most all of us have a consistent internet connection so this is not a problem for them. for those of us with intermittent internet connections, this is problem. when my internet is disconnected and i try to perform a reconcile, i get an error in the console: java.net.unknownhostexception: tools.wmflabs.org the error makes sense. the problem is, it stays in this state indefinitely even when an internet connection is established. i am getting working screen but it never goes away. please add a timeout and alert/abort so that users can fix the network issue and retry. thanks.
