 URL : "https://github.com/fortunejs/fortune-indexeddb/issues/2" TITLE : do not read from memory BODY : it should use disk at all times. the reasoning is that shared memory is hard to coordinate and it's much more reliable to just read from disk. the downside of this approach is that indexeddb does not provide any querying, so any query options would have to read entire collections from disk. id lookups should be fine though.
