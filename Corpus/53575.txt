 URL : "https://github.com/sdwolfe32/trumail/issues/2" TITLE : email provider support BODY : hey i wanted to know if you are focusing on specific providers because currently a lot of the german email providers aren't working with your api, for ex. gmx, web.de, 1&1 i think they have different responses and behaviours than the standard gmail, g-suite, yahoo, icloud do you intend to support those as well in the future? thanks ;
