 URL : "https://github.com/PowerlineApp/powerline-rn/issues/199" TITLE : question - block a user BODY : user a can block user b. if user b is blocked, then: - posts/petitions by user b do not appear in user a's feed. - comments by user b are not visible to user a on any user's item. - user b cannot see user a's posts or petitions in user b's feed. - user a does not receive @mention notifications from user b. - user a can unblock user b. we should try to design this in such a way that reduces manual / human intervention by powerline staff later. if user a is getting harassed by user b, blocking user should solve problem immediately. it would be good to know on backend if user b is being blocked by 1 user or 100 users so that we can investigate and disable account somehow... it's an important issue, but it only matters if there's enough people on the platform. @igaponov what is our level of effort on this please?
