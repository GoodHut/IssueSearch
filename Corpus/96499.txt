 URL : "https://github.com/ga4gh/task-execution-schemas/issues/28" TITLE : expand serviceinfo message BODY : the serviceinfo message currently contains only a map<string,string> for storage configuration, but storage configuration is likely more complex than a simple string to string map. for reference: proto //information about task execution service //may include information related but not limited to //resource availability and storage system information message serviceinfo { //system specific key/value pairs //example for a shared file system based storage system: //storagetype=sharedfile, basedir=/path/to/shared/directory map<string,string> storageconfig = 1; } funnel's storage configuration currently includes go code : go type localstorage struct { alloweddirs string } type s3storage struct { endpoint string key string secret string } packing these into a map<string,string> requires some trick, such as a composite key such as local.alloweddirs . having to define custom string packing/unpacking when we're using protobuf everywhere else feels wrong; it adds complexity and therefore a source of bugs and confusion.
