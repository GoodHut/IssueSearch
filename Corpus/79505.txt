 URL : "https://github.com/PathwayCommons/sbgn-renderer/issues/58" TITLE : signalling layout triage BODY : 1. scale both compartment region height and width based on number of nodes and edges it contains 2. reduce contrast of edges globally reduce edge opacity, on hover event for edges or hover on node and highlight the neighbours of the node 3. compartment nesting to model the cellular structure better nest compartments when they seem to belong to another compartment 4. re-layout a single compartment only -- user button / option remove bridge edges, run layout, re-attach edges 5. expand collapse -- reset position before expand, to be where the parent currently is 6. experimental + lower priority + more uncertainty + work - template / components for nodes / stereotyped arrangement - align non compartment nodes to the compartment level of their target - source and target nodes of cross compartment edges should have alignment - compartment jitter to reduce edge ambiguity translate compartment position-x
