 URL : "https://github.com/TDiazT/Comparator-RCoq/issues/30" TITLE : change report format BODY : i actually noted that the current way of displaying results is not really the best... when i was trying to decide the models for the database . currently it is: javascript
{ r_output : , processed_r_output : , status_code : , coq_output : , expression : , processed_coq_output : } where results and outputs are stored as array. the new way should look more like this: javascript
{ expression : , filename : , line : , sub_expression_report : { sub_expression : , raw_r_output : , processed_r_output : , status_code : , raw_coq_output : , processed_coq_output : }, } where each sub expression has its own object. i think it would be better to add a new method or class to handle report generation
