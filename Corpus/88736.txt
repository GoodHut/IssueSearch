 URL : "https://github.com/headmyshoulder/odeint-v2/issues/210" TITLE : openmp: copy openmp_state BODY : i'm using the openmp_state , and got a vast template-error from gcc-7.1 when doing so. the problem lies in external/openmp/openmp_state.hpp:96. gcc complains about not beeing able to assign a std::vector< double > and double in my case . i had to switch the line in the appropriate odeint header file from std::copy from i .begin , from i .end , to.begin to std::copy from i .begin , from i .end , to i .begin to get it worked. is this the right semantically correct solution or do i miss something?
