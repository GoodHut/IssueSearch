 URL : "https://github.com/la-haute-societe/ssh-deploy-release/issues/2" TITLE : decompress not working BODY : the decompressarchiveonremotetask does not work on my configuration. the _ cd + this.release.path_ command doesn't work so any of the following commands are performed on the root shell login. when i modify your code to use absolute paths for the untarring, just like you do with the rm, it's working perfectly. the server i am deploying to is an ubuntu 16.04. maybe it is os specific.
