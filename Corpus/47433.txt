 URL : "https://github.com/UBC-CPSC319/team-11/issues/18" TITLE : pdf exportable graphs BODY : have a button to export the dashboard as pdf. think the best way to do this, is to popup another webpage which rearranges the page with the graphs and charts in a clean way. then does a html -> pdf save with a npm package . or we can import that html -> pdf save, and make sure the dashboard saves cleanly without the navbar and other component things.
