 URL : "https://github.com/soxrepo/bootybot/issues/2" TITLE : add meetup function BODY : basically it would be nice to have a function where one can add a time, date, and place and everyone can sign up for the event. this way it would be easy to see who can make it. i thought of something like: !meet 23.05.2017 18:00 eating pizza at joe's place bootybot could reply with: eating pizza at joe's place id:3 23.05.2017, 18:00 to sign up type '!signup 3' in chat. where 3 is the id of the event. and people should then be able to sign up for it like this: !signup 3 a function to see the results of this would also need to be implemented: !meetinfo 3 could return eating pizza at joe's place id:3 23.05.2017, 18:00 coming: mike joe hannah to sign up type '!signup 3' in chat.
