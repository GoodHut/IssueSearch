 URL : "https://github.com/cvley/gocaffe/issues/5" TITLE : blob refactor plan BODY : as in caffe, blob template has int , float , double , and implementation with template in c++ is easy, but in golang, it is quite difficult, so i just use float64 . while i am working on the layer implementations, i feel blob refactor is needed. here is the plan: - blob will be the uniform container, avoid float64 and so on - use a value interface in blob , to represent different type, such as int , float64 - both blob and value have some basic math functions, so in layer implementation, i can just call them. maybe i will improve this later ðŸ˜„
