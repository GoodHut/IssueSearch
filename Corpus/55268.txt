 URL : "https://github.com/pgbovine/opt-cpp-backend/issues/42" TITLE : incorrect trace output BODY : when producing a trace on one system where there is a function call on the first line of the makefile, the trace is missing a call event. this was working before and i also have it working on a different system. i'm using the same version of the code on both as well as the same major version of gcc. i know this is sparse on details, but if you have any ideas what could be causing this, that would be helpful as i do more digging.
