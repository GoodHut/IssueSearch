 URL : "https://github.com/rails/activeresource/issues/251" TITLE : weird testing behaviour BODY : got model: class user < activeresource::base self.site = http://awesome.com/api/v2r end got mocking in spec file: activeresource::httpmock.respond_to do |mock| mock.post /users/login , json_headers, output.to_json end and got errors: could not find a response recorded for <post: /api/v2r/users/login.json { content-type => application/json } > - responses recorded are: <post: /users/login {\ accept\ =>\ application/json\ } > question is - why it partially ignores site property during test?
