 URL : "https://github.com/DmitryUlyanov/deep-image-prior/issues/21" TITLE : in painting implementation BODY : hi, i wanted to make sure i understand the algorithm as this is different a bit from typical dnns. assume i have two images with similar in-painting on both and i only have prior for one of them, can i train the dnn to remove the in-painting on one and then used the trained network to remove similar in-painting from other images that i don't have a prior to? thanks!
