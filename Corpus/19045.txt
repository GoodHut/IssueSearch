 URL : "https://github.com/containous/traefik/issues/2016" TITLE : what about limits BODY : hi, i wonder if there is a limit for frontends and backends for a single installation. my goal is to organize something around 400 backend containers and more than 100'000 frontend domain names may be more . can i do such thing with traefik ? do i need specific hardware memory / cpu to do the job ? i can't find any limit page in the documentation many thanks
