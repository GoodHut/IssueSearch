 URL : "https://github.com/mapseed/platform/issues/688" TITLE : localize on client side BODY : notes for myself and others : - this is what we're currently using https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/i18n/translation/ - these tags https://github.com/mapseed/platform/blob/6dcd9139054380161702d7aaa808fbcb37ab8e04/src/base/templates/base.html l293-l294 compile all our handlebars templates https://github.com/mapseed/platform/tree/master/src/base/jstemplates through the localization system before registering them as partials within the page how i envision this working: - use jquery.i18n https://github.com/wikimedia/jquery.i18n -- convert the current locale files into that banana format - register the localization function as a handlebars helper, and replace the django localization calls with it - store the locale in localstorage to emulate what django's doing, which is, i believe, using a session - on locale change, dynamically grab the new banana file and either send out some rerender signal to all templates or easier just refresh the page
