BODY : hi yoshifumi kawai, i'm newbie with serialization and i'm quite vague about how to save player progress in game using messagepack-csharp mpc . as i understand it, mpc is just for serialization. to saving data, i have to serialize my object to byte first, then write it to a file. and when i need loading data, i have to read that file to byte , then deserialize it to my object. is that right? if not, what is the fastest way to serialize data to files and deserialize data from files using mpc ? thanks and best regards!
