 URL : "https://github.com/duomark/esse/issues/8" TITLE : adaptive socket timeout BODY : there is a cap on the number of active socket sessions. when the server is busy, there may be a few sockets that are tied up in the 30 second polling state and the client has already disconnected. to speed up the likelihood of freeing a socket for reuse, the polling mechanism should run more quickly on a loaded server than on an unloaded server.
