 URL : "https://github.com/json-schema-org/json-schema-spec/issues/325" TITLE : description in the ldo BODY : the ldo has title but not description . when you think about the ldo in rfc 5988 or similar terms, this makes sense. but ldos can easily support much more information than most link descriptions. in my experience, most schema authors expect description to be present in the ldo as well and used by documentation tools. that doesn't violate any aspect of json hyper-schema, but i think it should be official as it is the obvious expected behavior within a json schema rather than rfc 5988 context.
