 URL : "https://github.com/CE-Programming/CEmu/issues/101" TITLE : appvar fails to transfer BODY : bug reported by epharius: the attached appvar can be transferred fine with ti-connect ce but fails on cemu. more precisely, it errors at link.c:134 https://github.com/ce-programming/cemu/blob/49fdd4e3bf2c0fb820db0fc8020bace39b430c81/core/link.c l134 c temp_size = 4 + size_t data_size + size_t data_start; if size_t lsize != temp_size goto r_err; as one can see with a debugger, at this point we have: lsize : 197 ; temp_size : 70. test.8xv.zip https://github.com/ce-programming/cemu/files/856686/test.8xv.zip _ note: this appvar was created with tivars_lib, so maybe i did mess up something, but at first and quick sight it appears correct _
