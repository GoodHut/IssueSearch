 URL : "https://github.com/ArtemGr/Sidekick/issues/89" TITLE : bot not responding BODY : first off, i love your bot and it's been working quite well for months now. today though, it just completely stopped working in one server no answers to any prompts at all , and i have no idea why. still shows online, and no permissions were changed at all since the last time it worked, so i have no idea what the problem is. i've tried kicking and reauthorizing the bot or giving it admin permissions, but nothing seems to work.
