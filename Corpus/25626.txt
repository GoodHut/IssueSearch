 URL : "https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/issues/113" TITLE : 4.6 is questionable BODY : the item 4.6 has the following recommendation: the	remote endpoint implements an exponential back-off, or temporarily locks the user account, when incorrect authentication credentials are submitted an excessive number of times. but note that if the server locks the user account after excessive attempts, it could be used as a weapon to dos the user account. a better solution could be block only the attacker maybe by its ip address , but this have the constraint that can't avoid distributed attacks. this solution is not perfect, but seems that is better than offering attackers a built-in dos. maybe a better description of this item could be something like the following: the	remote endpoint implements a mechanism to protect against the submission of credentials an excessive number of times.
