 URL : "https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/issues/1926" TITLE : add explicit favicon path BODY : as per w3 recommendations listed here https://www.w3.org/2005/10/howto-favicon for favicons, using the default path in root for favicon is discouraged. i believe we should change line 11 in index.html: <!-- place favicon.ico in the root directory --> to an explicit path to the favicon, the preferred method: <link rel= icon type= image/ico href= /favicon.ico > i can create a pull request if that would be helpful, please let me know what you think about this change :
