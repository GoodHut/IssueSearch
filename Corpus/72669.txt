 URL : "https://github.com/Promact/md2/issues/251" TITLE : cannot find module 'md2' BODY : bug, feature request, or proposal: i'm trying to use md2 in an ionic/angular 4 webpack application. what is the expected behavior? import md2 without an error. what is the current behavior? i followed the install instructions: ran: npm install md2 --save and added import to my app.module.ts but i didn't add to systemjs.config.js since that doesn't seem to exist in angular4 projects. when typescript compiles it can't find the module. 08:09:57 typescript: src/app/app.module.ts, line: 19 cannot find module 'md2'. l19: import { md2module } from 'md2'; what are the steps to reproduce? providing a plunker or similar is the best way to get the team to see your issue. plunker template: http://plnkr.co/edit/rqmuz8wyrh5vz4gwy8e4?p=info what is the use-case or motivation for changing an existing behavior? which versions of angular, md2, os, browsers are affected? is there anything else we should know?
