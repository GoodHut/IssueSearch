 URL : "https://github.com/WoWManiaUK/Redemption/issues/1320" TITLE : still continues to bug BODY : dawn of light bugged 6/24/17, and taking back archerus bugged no quest turn in immediately after a gm fixed dawn of light. i am a worgen and noticed in an earlier quest to kill the night elf npc that it also tried to give me the horde npc to kill quest. perhaps it is something within the worgen race that is disrupting the phases?
