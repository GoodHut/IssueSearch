 URL : "https://github.com/flutterwireless/ArduinoBoardPackage/issues/5" TITLE : max packet length BODY : in looking at the registers settings it looks like the max packet length is set for 255 bytes. however, when i send a packet of 150 bytes or so the receive end keeps failing - keeps giving me no data available or a erroneous packet lengths occasionally. at 75 bytes it seems to work fine. thanks mike
