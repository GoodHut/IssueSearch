 URL : "https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme/issues/252" TITLE : compact tag cloud BODY : i would like to make the 'tag cloud' tags/index.md more compact. i. e., to reduce the line spacing between the tags. i see that the tag list is styled with the tag-box class, which seems to be defined in the '_archives.scss' file. i assume i have to regenerate some css files. maybe i can touch the already generated files as well?
