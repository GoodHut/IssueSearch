 URL : "https://github.com/octref/vetur/issues/45" TITLE : not highlighting vue-html. BODY : i have .html files set up to use the vue-html language by default. i have my templates in separate .html files. up until the latest version it worked great. for some reason with latest version 0.3.5 it's not showing any highlighting anymore. i don't have any template tags or anything around the content since it's just straight up .html files.
