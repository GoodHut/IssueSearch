 URL : "https://github.com/servocoder/RichFilemanager/issues/121" TITLE : configs and vcs / composer BODY : i have seen all the issues regarding the dup configs. but my question is more related regarding the configs with deployments / vcs. what is the best practice here, i don't commit my vendor folder but that is where the configs are stored. is there any setting i can set in the connector that makes the connector change where the clientcode looks for the config that i overlooked?
