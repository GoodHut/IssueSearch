 URL : "https://github.com/MidwestFurryFandom/rams/issues/196" TITLE : badge numbering issues BODY : a few issues on this: on the checkin screen, after marking someone as paid, when attempting to check someone in, getting the following error: badge number required for attendee badges, a badge number is being shown on the attendees detail page for daily badges, no badge number is being assigned, even after payment. all badges no matter their type must have a badge number and they must be automatically assigned. they also shouldn't be able to be overwritten once assigned as easily as from the check in screen. i thought this was working before, maybe a setting got changed somewhere?
