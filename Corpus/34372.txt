 URL : "https://github.com/jruby-gradle/jruby-gradle-plugin/issues/314" TITLE : capturing all source BODY : i have a directory structure as such src -- entrypoint.rb -- db -- db_manager.rb and of course i could have multiple directories under src as well other source files i would like to capture all of my source not just the entrypoint.rb i.e. the initscript, ideally i would like to precompile my ruby such as one can with warbler , i could not find any references in the docs. i then tried using include within the jrubyjar spec which did not fail to build but failed to provide the desired results. > rubyjar { > / we want to use this ruby script as our start point when the jar executes > / > jrubyversion '9.1.13.0' > include ${projectdir}/src/db/ > initscript ${projectdir}/src/entrypoint.rb > > } and variations of , all which failed please advise , thanks
