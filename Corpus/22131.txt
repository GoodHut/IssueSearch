 URL : "https://github.com/gsnaider/project-euler/issues/1" TITLE : improve problem 43 BODY : instead of starting by searching pandigital numbers, start by searching all 3-digit numbers divisble by the divisors. then, if a number is divisible by a specific divisor, it should go to a bucket containing all 3-digit numbers that are divisible by that divisor. then we would have to see which combinations are possible between numbers from each bucket. we should check that the first two digits from one number match the last two digits from the other. by concatenating numbers this way, we would end up with a 10-digit number. then we should check if that number is pandigital.
