 URL : "https://github.com/knocean/knode/issues/49" TITLE : clean up routing table BODY : right now, we're using base compojure , which creates a central routing table structure. this has already led to minor merge conflicts among branches. ideally, we'd switch to a framework that allowed decentralized route declaration, or possibly rolling our own. in either case, we'd want it to expose a ring -compatible interface so that we could use all our existing middlewares.
