 URL : "https://github.com/KSP-RO/TacLifeSupport/issues/76" TITLE : recyclers are not working BODY : whenever i use any of the recyclers on one of my ships they just don´t work. they only sometimes work when i manually turn them off and back on again so this might be because they don´t do anything while i am not currently in the ship.
