 URL : "https://github.com/cloud8421/elm.mk/issues/26" TITLE : tests not passing BODY : after pr 25 tests do not pass with output elm.mk$ make ... ./tests.sh test 15 ls dummy/build/images/test.jpg failed: program terminated with code 2 instead of 0 test 16 ls dummy/build/images/test.png failed: program terminated with code 2 instead of 0 2 of 20 examples tests failed in 0.017s. makefile:4: recipe for target 'test' failed make: test error 1 it looks like build and build/images are part of the install_targets. calling make after make install results in the images being cp'd to build/images/images which breaks the test. the dist is unaffected because it is not part of the install_targets and images are cp'd directly from the root images folder. removing build and build/images from the install_targets solves the problem. i am opening a pr, and would love your feedback. great project by the way.
