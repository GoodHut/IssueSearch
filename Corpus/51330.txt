BODY : how do i use aes_gcm on a stream? i have tried splitting into chunks, and calling 'process' for each chunk, but when i eventually call 'finish' i get a security error as the tag is not correct. however if i put all the data in a single 'process' call it works. do i need to do something special between calls to process, or it this a bug?
