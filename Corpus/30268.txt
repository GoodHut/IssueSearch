 URL : "https://github.com/BTCMarkets/API/issues/59" TITLE : order details issue BODY : you can see by this below, the post request is receiving a 200 response and success:true but no actual details about the order. the second debug line is the raw response from the server. the info below is just once parsed. i sent an email and they forwarded me here. all other requests work as with creating orders; so my signing is fine as far as i can tell. ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9389452/32359788-196a8290-c09c-11e7-8887-8280c503fce0.png
