 URL : "https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker/issues/1299" TITLE : add sequence capabilities BODY : sometimes it's necessary to fake sequences. it would be nice to have a sequence generator that could handle the sequence code in the background. i have coded a rough version of a sequence generator for numbers that i could share in a pr integrating it to the package. the usage is: echo sequence 1 echo $faker->sequence ->next; echo $faker->sequence ->next; echo $faker->sequence ->next; echo sequence 2 echo $faker->sequence true ->next; echo $faker->sequence ->next; echo $faker->sequence ->next; echo sequence 3 echo $faker->sequence true, 25 ->next; echo $faker->sequence ->next; echo $faker->sequence ->next; and will output: sequence 1 1 2 3 sequence 2 1 2 3 sequence 3 25 26 27 based on this we could easily extend the functionality to have nextbit , nextoctal , nexthex , nextchars methods which could output the next element in sequence in binary, octal, hex format and chars that go from a to z and then from aa to zz and so on. do you think the package would benefit from something like this?
