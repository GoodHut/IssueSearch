 URL : "https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak/issues/276" TITLE : post full default config BODY : seems like there are tons of things that we should guess. i got the basic config from the config.tpl file and added single pool. but now it errors with some random things like use_nicehash , use_tls that are missing from the pool 0 config. when added it continues with another things like tls_fingerprint ..
