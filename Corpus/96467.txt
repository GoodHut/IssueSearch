 URL : "https://github.com/mitodl/micromasters/issues/2558" TITLE : exams: beta feature toggle BODY : we need to test this in production and need a mechanism to toggle this on as a beta feature so that we can soft-launch it with internal users. ideally, this is implemented generically so that we can reuse it for other feature rollouts in the future. suggested approach for the general mechanism: - implement a custom django middleware https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/http/middleware/ that checks for the presence of certain feature flags and sets a cookie that describes which feature flags are set. - implement a custom django middleware that parses the cookie so we can use it in views and templates. - apply some minimal effort to obfuscate the above as long as it don't make things too complicated - implement a feature flag using the above mechanism for exams
