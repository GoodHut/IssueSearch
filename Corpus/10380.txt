BODY : after the gig has been approved both of the parties should be able to cancel it if it matches our guideline. let's say i broke my arm and can't play it anymore. there is no clear way of canceling the gig. can we add cancel button in the confirmation that triggers an email to us? https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uhcskcrrxz-uka7bqdeakc0fj3_9oqwt
