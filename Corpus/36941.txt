 URL : "https://github.com/xenocrat/chyrp-lite/issues/42" TITLE : invalid security key BODY : noticed a problem with access using chrome on android device. first time logging into admin panel i get the message access denied invalid security key . on the second time it finally lets me in, but still the invalid security key message appears when trying to apply any changes in admin panel: settings, themes, writing a post, etc. other browsers seem to handle everything just fine. but still curious what might be the case and how it can be solved?
