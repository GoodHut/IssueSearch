 URL : "https://github.com/NextThingCo/chip-mali-userspace/issues/3" TITLE : question about usage BODY : i was linked to this project by some of the armbian guys. indicated this had x11 support and that non-x support would be possible. i could /accept/ x support, but would much prefer non-x support. i noticed you removed the header information for the non-x side of things. what was the rationale behind this? was it unavailable or just unused? if unused, could i branch from the version that had support for non-x operations?
