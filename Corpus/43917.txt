 URL : "https://github.com/atrauzzi/gerty/issues/17" TITLE : docker compose source BODY : docker-compose is basically already a process manifest format. rather than requiring manual configuration of processes found behind compose, just learn how to read the docker-compose.yml format. - abstract a processsource , similar to repositorysource - expand process meta to denote source - spin through all repositories , passing them through all configured processsources to obtain the current list of processes to track. this may cause a bit of upset as the running interface may have to be adjusted to read off of processstate instances rather than processes found in repositories - add type to processstate so that uis can filter using that data without needing the actual config
