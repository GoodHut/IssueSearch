 URL : "https://github.com/JuliaArrays/StaticArrays.jl/issues/333" TITLE : work with arrayviews BODY : i am interested in having https://github.com/juliaarrays/arrayviews.jl work for marray s, which i think would have just worked before https://github.com/juliaarrays/staticarrays.jl/issues/55. any suggestions for how to do this without defining specific methods for marray inside of arrayviews ? arrayviews works for any mutable array with a regular memory layout, so i thought this was exactly what densearray was for.
