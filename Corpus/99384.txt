 URL : "https://github.com/golang/protobuf/issues/367" TITLE : missing null field in json BODY : hi, i'm using jsonpb.marshaler.emitdefaults=true to output a json with zero values, which decide whether to render fields with zero values . but for a pointer field with zero value nil , the key is missing from the output json. according to the go programming language specification: each element of such a variable or value is set to the zero value for its type: false for booleans, 0 for integers, 0.0 for floats, for strings, and nil for pointers, functions, interfaces, slices, channels, and maps. so, nil is the zero value for pointers, am i correct? is it ok to output a json key with null ? or what's the main concern with it? thank you!
