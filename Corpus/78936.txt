 URL : "https://github.com/friendica/friendica/issues/3391" TITLE : replace smilies by emoji BODY : since db moved to utf8mb4 : we can use emoji and not smilies. i think it can be great to use and send emoji directly, maybe must validate if other server accept emoji ? 1. gs is ok with emoji, seems mastodon too 2. i'm sure twitter and facebook too hope ? 3. diaspora ? unsure 4. other's ? maybe only by plugin/extension and not then the default smilies by core ?
