 URL : "https://github.com/squix78/minigrafx/issues/10" TITLE : too less memory BODY : i tried to expand the color weatherstation with using mozilla location service mls and json-streaming-parser. mls needs a clientsecure https connection. minigrafx, clientsecure and the string class need too much ram, causing an exception 29 crash. is it possible to initialisize minigrafx after closing clientsecure ? so i would like to geolocate in setup to get the coordinates before using minigrafx. marcus
