 URL : "https://github.com/bitwarden/mobile/issues/41" TITLE : allow search on autofill BODY : when autofill fails to find a match or if it finds the wrong match then the only thing to do is tap x, find the right entry, and fill the form manually via the clipboard. please add an autofill search box so that i can fill arbitrary entries into apps and websites. for apps, it would be helpful if there were a way to record the association for future. for websites, a big red anti-phishing warning might be appropriate, but please make it possible.
