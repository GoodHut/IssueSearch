 URL : "https://github.com/twosigma/git-meta/issues/417" TITLE : forward more commands BODY : there's currently a small set of forwarded commands: at https://github.com/twosigma/git-meta/blob/13120986efc8dc5cc8ca82cb9c0070d085977a5f/node/lib/cmd/forward.js l74 i see branch, fetch, remote, tag . we should probably forward lots more. users will expect them to be there. one just complained about show . maybe forwarding should be blacklisted rather than whitelisted? then as git itself gains new commands they will get forwarded automatically?
