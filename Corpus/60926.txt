 URL : "https://github.com/pasteit/pasteit/issues/24" TITLE : add redis configuration BODY : at the moment the redis db is not access with a password. best would be to implement something which allows machine-specific properties, i.e. application-threepwood.properties for running on a machine named threepwood. in there a password for the db is stored and read out when connecting to the db.
