 URL : "https://github.com/BrunoSalerno/citylines/issues/70" TITLE : integration with osm BODY : at least, there should be an option to import features from osm. - we could use the overpas api wrapper https://github.com/brunosalerno/overpass-api-ruby - the area should match a the viewport or a circle with a certain radius from the city coords - osm tags should be selectable with checkboxes - the osm data should be loaded in the editor mode, and not saved it would require further editing from the user
