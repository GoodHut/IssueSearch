 URL : "https://github.com/Cxbx-Reloaded/Cxbx-Reloaded/issues/677" TITLE : design a gui BODY : separate from which visual component library we'll be using 578 , we must first have a solid design for our user-interface, before we can even consider implementing it. a quick search https://www.google.nl/search?q=emulator+gui&tbm=isch shows there exist many user-interfaces, from which we can learn what to do, and what not to do. in this issue, discuss all consideration, reach consensus, create a mock-up, and prepare all other things required for building a suitable, modern, fast, user-friendly user-interface for cxbx-reloaded.
