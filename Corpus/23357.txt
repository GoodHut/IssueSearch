 URL : "https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16811" TITLE : parse json string? BODY : hi, i'm using jsonencode in combination with external data source to pass a json object as as string to an external program. this external program also produces an json object which i'm able to pass back to terraform as a string. now i can't find a way to cast this stringified json object to a map. somehow the jsondecode seems to be missing. is there a way to do it?
