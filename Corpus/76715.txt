 URL : "https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop/issues/25" TITLE : low barcode assignment % BODY : hello, i'm trying to run a fasta file produced from the sqk-rlb001 kit and am getting nearly half of my sequences in the 'none' file, even after lowering the barcode threshold to 20. is this something other users have experienced? i know minion data isn't exactly error-free. have the barcodes in the known adapters been updated to the new kit releases? my apologies if this is a silly question. thanks for making a great open source program, ryan! - catherine
