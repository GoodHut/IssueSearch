 URL : "https://github.com/GNS3/gns3-gui/issues/2224" TITLE : add appliance wizard BODY : the process to add a new appliance is too convoluted and has too many redundant steps: - 1 import appliance dialog - 1 open appliance dialog - 7 window wizard - 2 confirmation message boxes most of the steps just consist of clicking next without actually giving a meaningful choice or the default being appropriate in 90% of all cases. wouldn't it be better to consolidate the wizard to just two or three windows? 1. which image should be installed where vm/local/etc and using which qemu? 2. confirmation window showing the appliance details and usage message and file copy progress bar also the open appliance dialog doesn't remember the previous location and the file copy progress bar does not reflect the actual progress, would be great if that could be fixed too.
