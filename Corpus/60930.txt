 URL : "https://github.com/iptomar/projectary-api/issues/60" TITLE : add removed md5 hashing BODY : issue about it on the database: https://github.com/iptomar/projectary-bd/issues/132 the database shouldn't do the hashing and encryption of the passwords, the server/api should do it: you're wasting precious processing power on the database. the database has logs and will store some operations so sending passwords plain text is naive. if we want to move to something like bcrypt you would have problems on both sides - you can relate this with my first point and the lack of bcrypt or similar on mysql.
