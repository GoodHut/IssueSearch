 URL : "https://github.com/uzikilon/backbone-poller/issues/45" TITLE : not compatible with lodash BODY : hi @uzikilon, thanks for making this project! i've been building a project using lodash instead of underscore and i think i've found an issue where _.each is called in set https://github.com/uzikilon/backbone-poller/blob/master/backbone.poller.js l98 using this - which doesn't seem to be supported by lodash. this means whenever poller.get model is called, an error is raised.
