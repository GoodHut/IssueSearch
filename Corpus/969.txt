 URL : "https://github.com/WarEmu/WarBugs/issues/9741" TITLE : bring it on BODY : this abillity seem to only be able to hit 1 target back every icd wich is really wierd for an abillity in a aoe mastery. i'm asuming the slayers equvilent is the same due to icd being handled in the same way. it should be icd on the target that attacks you not icd on the abillity completly.
