 URL : "https://github.com/garrettpauls/JumbleRef/issues/2" TITLE : maintain known images BODY : a set of known images will be kept which can then be used in multiple galleries. we maintain this list instead of keeping images directly in galleries prevent keeping duplicate source images, which would use extra space as well as additional items in the future access list, which is a very limited resource. the user should be able to add and remove multiple images from this set.
