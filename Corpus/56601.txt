 URL : "https://github.com/zuko84/prj-rev-bwfs-dasmoto/issues/3" TITLE : no more inline styling BODY : don't use inline styling in html anymore. now all styling goes in the css, this is good practice. the major reason for this is that inline styling is more work. you need to write style for every element. in css you can create classes that can be used for many elements, as well as target all of a certain tag. https://github.com/zuko84/prj-rev-bwfs-dasmoto/blob/master/project4/index.html l21
