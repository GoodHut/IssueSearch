 URL : "https://github.com/nlampi/SwiftGridView/issues/27" TITLE : scroll to top BODY : hello @nlampi i am trying to scroll to the top of the grid via: self.datagridview.scrolltocellatindexpath indexpath forsgrow: 0, atcolumn: 0, insection: 0 , atscrollposition: .top, animated: true but it won't budge. i previously tried setting scrollstotop to true, but i have other uiscrollviews in the main interface and i think that would be an issue. so, i am trapping taps on the status bar, and my app's main toolbar and manually calling the method above. any ideas? thanks
