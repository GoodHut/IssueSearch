 URL : "https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django/issues/1028" TITLE : gulp with docker BODY : with cookiecutter gulp doesn't currently support docker out of the box... it would be reaalllly nice to have gulp work out of the box with docker. i'm sure i'm not the first person interested in this feature. if anyone is interested, with cookiecutter django i've got gulp running as it's own docker container with live browser reload working! my project is standard cookiecutter. here's the file modifications to get this to work: dev.yml specifies gulp as it's own service: https://github.com/jamesaud/reuserat/blob/feature/shopify/dev.yml l35-l47 gulpfile.js the proxy is set to the django container: https://github.com/jamesaud/reuserat/blob/feature/shopify/gulpfile.js l90 the dockerfile and build for docker-compose is here and a little bit hacky. if anyone could help with the entrypoint.sh file, it would be nice : https://github.com/jamesaud/reuserat/tree/feature/shopify/compose/gulp thoughts on this?
