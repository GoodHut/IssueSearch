 URL : "https://github.com/fzakaria/transcoding/issues/1" TITLE : docker build not working. BODY : hi, i thought i would give this a go. in the docker build i changed the from to jrottenberg/ffmpeg:3.3-centos because the base image now defaults to ubuntu so yum won't work. i got as far as go get github.com/fzakaria/transcoding/ but that errors with package context: unrecognized import path context . any ideas?
