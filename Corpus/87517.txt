 URL : "https://github.com/dadi/format-error/issues/1" TITLE : load error codes from url BODY : currently the codes are loaded from the codes.json file in the npm package, but to make it easier to update the codes i'd prefer if they were loaded from the repo url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dadi/format-error/master/codes.json the interface should remain the same so the following code works: var formaterror = require '@dadi/format-error' var err = formaterror.createapierror '0001'
