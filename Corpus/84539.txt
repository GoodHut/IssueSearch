 URL : "https://github.com/dcodeIO/protobuf.js/issues/930" TITLE : decode a list of messager BODY : protobuf.js version: 6.8.0 hi, i have the following protocol buffer definition that was provided to me: js package proto; option optimize_for = lite_runtime; message device { required string deviceid = 1; required int32 signalstrength = 2; required devicetype devicetype = 3; optional string uuid = 4; } message devicesframe { required int64 timestamp = 1; required int32 framesize = 2; repeated device devices = 3; } enum devicetype { bt = 0; ble = 1; wifi = 2; } the buffer i am reading contains several devicesframe instances, each one preceded by its lenght and i can read the first one: js protobuf.load 'devicesframe.proto', err, root => { if err { throw err; } const devicesframe = root.lookuptype 'proto.devicesframe' ; const message = devicesframe.decodedelimited buf ; // ... } i don't know how to skip to the next devicesframe and loop through the buffer till the end. i was given the following sample python code that loops through the data buffer using the google protobuffer library, but i don't know how to do the same thing in node.js and i'd rather avoid google's protobuffer implementation because of it's messy installation : py while n < len data : msg_len, new_pos = _decodevarint32 data, n n = new_pos msg_buf = data n:n+msg_len n += msg_len message = devicesframe.devicesframe message.parsefromstring msg_buf thanks in advance for any help and sorry for the seemingly trivial question!
