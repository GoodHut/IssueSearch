 URL : "https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js/issues/170" TITLE : problem running the demos BODY : hello there. my name is ivano arrighetta and i'm italian. i tried opening the demos in both firefox and chrome, the latter with a webserver. the only demo i was able to see was webgl_demo, but i can just see the plane. no cubes, no physics. does ammo.js require something additional rather than just a web browser? eg. node or something thanks in advance for any help. bye, ivano.
