 URL : "https://github.com/mrmlnc/material-shadows/issues/7" TITLE : interpolating depth values BODY : the depth is currently defined in fixed values 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 16, 24 . however the specs dictate that interpolation should be possible for sub-menu's. meaning a depth of any natural number should be possible. i get that it might be difficult to generate functions that interpolate the shadow properties, however, i think it should be possible.
