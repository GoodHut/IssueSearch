 URL : "https://github.com/influxdata/kapacitor/issues/1635" TITLE : no pushover notifications BODY : i obtained a paid pushover account, and set up kapacitor to use pushover. ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13875703/31948522-02c84ee0-b88c-11e7-93ed-c932661043c6.png i was excited to be able to receive push notifications as a result of this, but despite intentionally setting alarms, no notifications were sent. i am able to send test notifications from pushover's website that are received properly. however, nothing gets sent from kapacitor, even when alerts that were set to trigger pushover are clearly visible in the history.
