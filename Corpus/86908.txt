 URL : "https://github.com/Headline22/Challenge/issues/12" TITLE : incorrect arenas assigned BODY : i believe after version 1.1.0 this issue started occurring; upon joining server and joining team, you are put straight into arena 1. even if you win arena 1 some rounds you get pushed back an arena. when i unload the plugin and join a team, i get put in the last arena and everything works fine again. i'll update when i figure out which version this started occurring in.
