 URL : "https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/FALCON_unzip/issues/101" TITLE : fc_quiver and phasing BODY : dear pacbio team, i would like to test different alignment parameters with blasr and then polish my assembly directly with quiver without using the fc_quiver.py script. but i have a question. my main goal is to keep the phase of my genome and i would like to know if the fc_quiver.py script participates in this step of phasing? or only fc_unzip participates in this step of phasing ? thank you. best, amandine
