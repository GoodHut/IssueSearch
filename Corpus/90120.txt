 URL : "https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama-docs/issues/48" TITLE : rudp documentation update BODY : i think but this is just from reading the prs there are only a couple of things to be documented and that's the addition of an optional bool reliable to the send method: c void send<t> incollatedmessage<t> message, action<t> callback, action<inerror> errback ; void send inuncollatedmessage message, bool reliable, action<bool> callback, action<inerror> errback ; void send inuncollatedmessage message, action<bool> callback, action<inerror> errback ; and also the builder function with an extra type for client: c _client = new nclient .builder defaultkey , transporttype.udp .host localhost .port 7350 .ssl false .build ; one thing i'm not sure about - in the blog post https://blog.heroiclabs.com/nakama-1-2-released-udp-advanced-matchmaker-and-javascript-d9e9e46b6bd it discusses rudp versus websocket. is creating a client with the transporttype.udp creating an rudp client connection? i got most of this info from this commit https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama-unity/commit/74a9902da562df5158770e738cf954bf34f0f99f diff-4ac32a78649ca5bdd8e0ba38b7006a1e .
