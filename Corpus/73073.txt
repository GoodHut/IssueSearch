 URL : "https://github.com/dpzhang/MACS30200proj/issues/1" TITLE : comments on data/methods BODY : use one section for the data, one for methods, and one for the results. you do not need to split everything up in subsections. also avoid having so many lists in each subsection, try to write as much as possible in actual text. for table 4, if n=77 for all variables, you can just write this in the table caption and omit that column. the figures look nice. the regression output tables seems to be in raw form. these need to be formatted. otherwise, this looks good.
