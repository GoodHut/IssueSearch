 URL : "https://github.com/soabase/exhibitor/issues/330" TITLE : requests: 4ltr options BODY : i'd love to see any or all the following features in exhibitor: - a dropdown list of four-letter words to send to a server preferably on the control panel page itself; otherwise in the 4ltr popup - a mechanism to send a four-letter word to all running zk servers at once perhaps with a confirmation dialog, esp. for the heavier commands - similarly, a state indicator a la the mntr zk_server_state for whether a zk server is leading, following, or what have you
