 URL : "https://github.com/Genymobile/gnirehtet/issues/56" TITLE : strange issue with adaway BODY : i have a very strange issue with adaway https://github.com/adaway/adaway , which i recently began using. when i add some user-defined redirection host - address, gnirehtet stops working. if i erase it it works again. so my question is: is there any way to get logs from gnirehtet just to try to figure out what is happening?
