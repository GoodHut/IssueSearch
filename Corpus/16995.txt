 URL : "https://github.com/airbnb/css/issues/42" TITLE : move to sass-lint BODY : > the sass core team is now building sass in dart instead of ruby, and will no longer be maintaining the ruby implementation unless a maintainer steps up to help. since the scss-lint project relies on the ruby sass implementation, this means it will eventually not support the latest sass features and bug fixes. so moving to sass-lint https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint seems the right thing to do. especially that sass-lint is on npm. both sass-lint and scss-lint should be close. i may create a pr to create a sass-lint if you agree. i prefer open issue and a pr as it may have multiple changes readme, the .sass-lint.yml file, we may delete the .scss-lint.yml file etc.
