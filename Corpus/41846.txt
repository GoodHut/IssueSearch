 URL : "https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle/issues/378" TITLE : add modify middleware BODY : hi guys, i was thinking how to make the webpack modification cleaner and i came with this idea. creating middlewares each responsible for it's own task. this works for me really well and so maybe we could consider implementing it into razzle. this is how i handle it: addmiddlewares.js const r = require 'ramda' ; const addmiddewares = middlewares => baseconfig, info, webpack => { const config = object.assign {}, baseconfig ; return r.compose ...middlewares.map middleware => middleware info, webpack config ; }; module.exports = addmiddewares; and then in my razzle.config.js const handlescss = require './webpack/modifiers/addscss' ; const addpatchhotreaload = require './webpack/modifiers/addpatchhotreaload' ; const addaliases = require './webpack/modifiers/addaliases' ; const addgraphqql = require './webpack/modifiers/addgraphql' ; const addantd = require './webpack/modifiers/addantd' ; const addmiddleware = require './webpack/addmiddleware' ; module.exports = { modify: addmiddleware handlescss, addpatchhotreaload, addaliases, addgraphqql, addantd , }; what do you think about this?
