 URL : "https://github.com/rigor789/nativescript-vue/issues/8" TITLE : improve app bootstrapping BODY : currently the user has to create a page, and pass it to nativescript-vue . it seems unnecessary, since it could just be wrapped in <page></page> tags. figure out a way to automatically create a navigation entry, and navigate! ideally an app would consist of a main.js file with something like: const vue = require 'nativescript-vue' const mainpage = require './mainpage.js' const vm = new vue { ...mainpage // or just define everything here } .$mount and mainpage.js : export default { template: <page> <stack-layout> hello world </stack-layout> </page> }
