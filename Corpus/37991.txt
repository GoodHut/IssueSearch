 URL : "https://github.com/gisenberg/proposal-nullary-coalescing/issues/3" TITLE : nit: nullary misused BODY : this is minor, but worth getting right: per https://www.bing.com/search?q=nullary+definition, nullary means taking no arguments or having trivial domain. thus if null or undefined is a nullary value so are 42, hi , and false. precedent in es-discuss is to use some variation on existential operator, but there are too many variations ;- . coffeescript uses soak , which is evocative. not sure what to suggest, but i don't think nullary should be abused. thanks. https://esdiscuss.org/topic/existential-operator-null-propagation-operator
