 URL : "https://github.com/NSwag/NSwag/issues/603" TITLE : anonymous class generation BODY : this might be more a forum entry but i don't know were to put it. maybe stackoverflow? based on this c class hierachy: c //tour public interface itour public class tour : itour public interface itourextend : itour public class tourextend : tour, itourextend //tourstopp public interface itourstopp public class tourstopp : itourstopp public interface itourstoppextend : itourstopp public class tourstoppextend : tourstopp, itourstoppextend the following typescript hierachy is generated: typescript // tour export class anonymous export class tourextend extends anonymous export class tour export class itour export class itourextend // tourstopp export class itourstopp export class itourstoppextend export class tourstopp export class tourstoppextend extends tourstopp i wonder why an anonymous class is generated for tour where as there is no anonymous class for tourstopp. i would expect a similar hierachy in typescript as in c .
