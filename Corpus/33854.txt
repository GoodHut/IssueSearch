 URL : "https://github.com/Unihedro/AutoTrimps/issues/46" TITLE : automaps not working BODY : for some reason once i did c^2 challenges autotrimps stopped using maps even with automaps on. it just progresses even when it says prestige on automaps. then when i hover over it it will say my ratio is multiple hundreds off of what it should be and enoughhealth and enoughdamage are false but it still just keeps trying to push without maps
