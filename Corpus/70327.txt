 URL : "https://github.com/aurelia-ui-toolkits/aurelia-syncfusion-bridge/issues/81" TITLE : v2.2 jquery not defined BODY : so i'm using this bridge and just upgraded a new project to 2.2. with the aurelia-skeleton-navigation typescript setup i've added npm:syncfusion-javascript via jspm along with this bridge. upon running the app jquery doesn't seem to be imported at any point by the bridge and doesn't end up loading in the browser. also i'll note when i include the bridge components in a jspm bundle, jquery is not included as a dependency. rolling the version back to 1.2 fixes everything. browser error: referenceerror: jquery is not defined at ejmaskedit.createwidget widget-base.js:60
