 URL : "https://github.com/Citillara/CitiBot/issues/28" TITLE : request cookiewars BODY : similar to bidwars, a good use to burn cookies is to use them for user choices, the choice with more cookies is the one what wins. example: what to play tomorrow? !cookiewar ff8 <cuantity> or !cookiewar tombraider <cuantity> so the choice who got more cookies given, will be the result of tomorrow's stream. this can be aplied to pretty much anything, like choice of diferent endings, polls... all in a free manner, and with heavy focus on actual active users in the channel. it would be +100 internet points if the actual streamer or mods could set the options manually, in case someone types ff89 instead of ff8, it would return something like: current cookiewars are ff8 and tombraider. what do you think? good or bad idea?
