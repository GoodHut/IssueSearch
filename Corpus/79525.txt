 URL : "https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/issues/1087" TITLE : simplying the public api BODY : currently there are a few ways to use the styled api: 1. creating a new styled-component: styled.div 2. adding styles to an existing react component: styled mycomponent 3. extending an existing styled-component: styledthing.extend i believe the api can be made much simpler by making use case 3 an implementation detail, rather than something the developer needs to think about and cross-check. rationale styled-components knows when it is passed another styled component. at the point of element creation, it knows what the most optimal way to generate the styles is and has the ability to select that path for the user. as a developer, it's not great that i constantly need to be looking at the implementation of components i consume to know if i need to use styled or .extend . bonus round: get rid of the tag whitelist the api can be made even simpler by doing away with the tag whitelist entirely and always requiring the function syntax, e.g. js ðŸš« styled.div âœ… styled 'div' now there is only one way to do everything and the library remains eminently approachable. it also means that styled-components will automatically support new html tags with zero effort. with the above suggestions, the api becomes equivalent for all three use cases: js styled 'div' styled mycomponent styled styledthing
