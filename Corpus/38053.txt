 URL : "https://github.com/marklogic/java-client-api/issues/732" TITLE : no persisted options BODY : be able to specify all query parameters at runtime without having to persist anything on the server other than code to invoke, like transformations, resource extensions , including limit, sorting, etc. i think the whole notion of persistent query options was a holdover from the e-node search api and a misstep from the clientsâ€™ perspective. if a java app wants to save a query spec or partial query spec , it should do it in a java variable, not as data on the server.
