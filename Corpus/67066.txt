 URL : "https://github.com/espressif/openocd-esp32/issues/4" TITLE : openocd on raspberry pi BODY : i'm trying to compile openocd on a raspberry pi and i'm hitting this issue: rtos_freertos_stackings.c: in function 'rtos_freertos_esp108_stack_read_voluntary': rtos_freertos_stackings.c:375:22: error: cast increases required alignment of target type -werror=cast-align uint32_t stackregs= uint32_t stack_data; //alias so we can read/write entire words. little-endian hosts only! which make sense since the code mentions it doesn't work on big endian machines. i'd like to use a raspberry pi as jtag adapter but i can't get it to compile.
