 URL : "https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/577" TITLE : options for suspended url BODY : it was a 5 star add-on until it recently couple months back? updated to included the page title in the suspended tab's address bar url. i used to grab urls with cau https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/copy-all-urls/djdmadneanknadilpjiknlnanaolmbfk and could easily mass extract the urls i.e. for sharing by removing tgs's extension text with a search/replace. now everything is garbled up! i don't want to have to unsuspend the tabs just to copy the urls, then suspend them again later. please add an option to not have the title info there.
