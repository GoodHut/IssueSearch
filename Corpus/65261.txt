 URL : "https://github.com/coinfoundry/miningcore/issues/27" TITLE : improving api responses BODY : as i am working on the client-side ui, i think there are few improvements can be done on api for developer use. /api/pools https://github.com/coinfoundry/miningcore/blob/master/readme.md apipools 1. instead of providing coin : { type : 5 }, , give the coin symbol instead. in this case, it is xmr . it is not friendly for integrations. 2. payoutscheme : 1, , which is better to give pplns . same problem as above 3. networkhashrate , poolhashrate unit? h/s ? kh/s ? mh/s ? 4. it is weird to put poolfeepercent , donationspercent inside poolstats . i think they belongs to paymentprocessing or a brand new item. the api should avoid hardcoding definitions into the ui, especially ui shouldn't need to update their coding once miningcore added new cointype / changed cointype numerical value. /api/pool/{poolid}/stats/hourly https://github.com/coinfoundry/miningcore/blob/master/readme.md apipoolpoolidstatshourly 5. is it possible to provide the networkhashrate , connectedminers as well? 6. same as 3. /api/pool/{poolid}/blocks https://github.com/coinfoundry/miningcore/blob/master/readme.md apipoolpoolidblocks 7. what is status here? same problem as above /api/pool/{poolid}/payments https://github.com/coinfoundry/miningcore/blob/master/readme.md apipoolpoolidpayments 8. same as 1. other issue: 9. there isn't an endpoint for miner list. i will continue update this issue while i am implementing the ui.
