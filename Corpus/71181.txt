 URL : "https://github.com/fbsamples/messenger-platform-samples/issues/58" TITLE : account linking question BODY : can someone post this full working example of peter's hats please : tried all sorts of combinations and read and reread the messenger-platform documentation https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/account-linking for the past 50 hours it just isn't clear how to do this. the only semi relevant thing regarding this process i could find on the vast internets was this article which didn't seem to work anymore http://espeo.eu/blog/user-permissions-messenger-bots/ can this auth backend run on another server ? i tried running it in an express + passport on my localhost. got a button to link the login , managed to see the window asking for permission but couldn't get rid of the window that opens. where should i redirect the user ? is it possible to login without a webview? // router.get '/login/facebook/callback', // passport.authenticate 'facebook', { // successredirect: 'server/views/closewindow.html', // failureredirect: '/' // } // ;
