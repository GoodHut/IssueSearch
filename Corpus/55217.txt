 URL : "https://github.com/guardianproject/proofmode/issues/11" TITLE : improve share proof ux BODY : how can we make the user experience of that step more intuitive - i think that it is the weak link in the current workflow from user perspective. eg, can we not have shareproof appear as an option at that second step? also can we limit the number of apps that appear at the second step? can we make that window look a bit different so users don't get confused with previous step?
