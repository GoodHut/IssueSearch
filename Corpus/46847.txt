 URL : "https://github.com/cakephp/docs/issues/5501" TITLE : mysql driver with ssl BODY : i faced an issue where i can't establish a secure connection to a remote mysql database. it seems like when i add the following line in cake\database\driver\mysql : if !empty $config 'ssl_key' && !empty $config 'ssl_cert' { $config 'flags' pdo::mysql_attr_ssl_key = $config 'ssl_key' ; $config 'flags' pdo::mysql_attr_ssl_cert = $config 'ssl_cert' ; $config 'flags' pdo::mysql_attr_ssl_verify_server_cert = false; } it seems to work. i also created a stackoverflow question https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47995069/cakephp-3-mysql-connection-over-ssl related to this. is there another solution to achieve a secure connection without modifiying cakes code?
