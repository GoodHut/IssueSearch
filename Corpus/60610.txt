 URL : "https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/812" TITLE : add a cff2charstringpen BODY : the current t2charstringpen only works with type 2 charstrings and cff 1.0. we need a corresponding cff2charstringpen module, that takes into account the difference between type 2 and cff2 charstrings: https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/cff2.htm charstrings once we have that, then ufo2ft could use it to generate fonts with cff2 table. of course, all depends on having cff2 read/write support merged first see 805 .
