 URL : "https://github.com/opencb/opencga/issues/616" TITLE : add the concept of release BODY : opencga has been designed with the idea of being used in research institutions where the concept of delivering data up to a point may have sense among other things. for this reason, we think it would be really interesting adding a new field that we will call 'release'. this 'release' field will be added to all the data models except for user, variable and annotation. release will be an integer value 1,2... that will be defined in the main configuration file and will be used everytime a new entry is created. everytime something is created it will contain the release number stored in the configuration file. once the institution needs to do one deliverable and finishes one of the releases , they will update that value in the main configuration file so every new entry created will belong to a different release.
