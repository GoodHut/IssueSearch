 URL : "https://github.com/GreenInfo-Network/caliparks.org/issues/651" TITLE : server side rendering? BODY : relating to 650 was server-side rendering ever considered? the way react router is currently being used seems odd, as the routing seems to be handled by express, not react router. if the initial app state were rendered server side then react router could handle the routing, the app would be a spa, express would be used solely as an api and _not_ for routing. on the other hand if the express routes are absolutely necessary then it seems react router may not be needed? @sconnelley @mojodna any insights on the current setup with express and react router would be appreciated, thanks.
