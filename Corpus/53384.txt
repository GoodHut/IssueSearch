 URL : "https://github.com/kamilmysliwiec/nest/issues/11" TITLE : documentation id issue BODY : on this page https://kamilmysliwiec.gitbooks.io/nest/content/quick-start/components.html you're looking for users using the find method, but the ids are stored in the service as numbers and the received param will be a string. so here's a quick fix: this: typescript @requestmapping { path: '/:id' } getuser req, res { this.usersservice.getuser req.params.id .then user => res.status 200 .json user ; } needs to change to this: typescript @requestmapping { path: '/:id' } getuser req, res { this.usersservice.getuser number req.params.id // simply casted to number .then user => res.status 200 .json user ; } i know it's just an example for demonstration purposes, but it should work nonetheless.
