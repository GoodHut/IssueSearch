 URL : "https://github.com/ethayer/lock-manager/issues/24" TITLE : location.timezone is null BODY : i see this error in the logs: java.lang.nullpointerexception @ line 619 i think this is the line it's referring to: def today = new date .format eeee , location.timezone i think the reason the error happens is because, when i installed the smartthings ios app, i told ios to not allow the app to access to gps. to fix the issue, i'm guessing the code should be changed to get the timezone a different way, or else handle the situation where it can't be detected.
