 URL : "https://github.com/gophish/gophish/issues/823" TITLE : a bit of help with headers BODY : hello, i checked the documentation but i did not seem to find anything about email headers there. i am using the latest version of gophish: gophish-v0.4 sender's email address is: hr@test1@.com i would like to send a phishing email to company test.com so that instead of having hr@test1.com in the email header they will only see hr@test.com or just hr. i know this can be done with email headers but unfortunately i have not been able to find any documentation anywhere about it. thank you in advance
