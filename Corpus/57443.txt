 URL : "https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-js/issues/310" TITLE : published private key? BODY : was casually browsing your repo and noticed you published a private key for your service https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-js/blob/master/.crossbar/key.priv . not sure how your service uses these, but traditionally private keys are meant to be... private. figured i'd let you know in case this was unintended.
