 URL : "https://github.com/banago/PHPloy/issues/305" TITLE : phar without require-dev BODY : i've found that the latest bin/phploy.phar in the master branch is extra-small 368 kb . it came with the commit from @ogrosko. it looks like it was built with composer --no-dev install . currently executing ./build produces much larger file ~1.2 mb , and this line: https://github.com/banago/phploy/blob/master/build l29 for some reason does not prevent from inclusion of complete vendor dir to the final phar. phar from 4.5 https://github.com/banago/phploy/blob/4.5/bin/phploy.phar is 2.44 mb. sure it's not the most important thing but it's great when resulting phar is beautifully small and free from unnecessary dependencies. please take into consideration if possible :
