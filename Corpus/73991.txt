 URL : "https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9529" TITLE : doc: state and lifecycle BODY : from doc about state and lifecycle there is this class class clock extends react.component { constructor props { super props ; this.state = {date: new date }; } componentdidmount { this.timerid = setinterval => this.tick , 1000 ; } componentwillunmount { clearinterval this.timerid ; } tick { this.setstate { date: new date } ; } render { return <div> <h1>hello, world!</h1> <h2>it is {this.state.date.tolocaletimestring }.</h2> </div> ; } } reactdom.render <clock />, document.getelementbyid 'root' ; my question is: since setstate is asynch can't it happen that some calls to setstate inside tick function get a pending state, and for example for three seconds update won't be applied to the state? in that case, we could get three seconds missing from the ui, isn't it? or i am wrong?
