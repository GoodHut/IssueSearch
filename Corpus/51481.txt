 URL : "https://github.com/benkeen/generatedata/issues/421" TITLE : api runs in demo mode? BODY : generating some api calls and noticed that the number of results returned was not exceeding 100 rows. i had set the $maxgeneratedrows = 1000 in settings.php file. after some playing around i was able to determine that the $maxdemomoderows parameter was being evaluated using the api. once i overrode that parameter by adding it to the settings.php file and setting the value to 1000, everything works fine. why is demo mode even a factor with using the api? bug?
