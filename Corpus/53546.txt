 URL : "https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/20870" TITLE : edit link in html docs BODY : if i click the edit on github link on a manual page, it currently takes me to the page of a specific commit, e.g. this one https://github.com/julialang/julia/blob/017f5b4e5efaa6c32463bfaf610732906b82a2cc/doc/src/manual/introduction.md . however github doesn't let you edit pages that correspond to specific commits, so you need to first change the branch to master by clicking on the tree dropdown menu, finding master buried in there somewhere, clicking on it , then clicking the edit icon. that's a lot of extra steps: 3 extra clicks, and a bit of searching, even if you know what exactly to do. the situation is a even more confusing for standard library pages: clicking on edit on github will take you to the index page. to get to the docs of an individual function you need click on source instead, but when you change branches it loses the line numbers. one possible solution would be to have separate source and edit latest this could just be a pen icon? links for both the pages and the embedded function docs: the source link would take you to the commit source as it does currently. the edit latest link would open up the same file on master, in the github editor: e.g. https://github.com/julialang/julia/edit/master/base/docs/helpdb/base.jl l1914-l1929. obviously this has problems in that the path or line numbers may have changed between the commit and the branch, but there's not much we can really do about that.
