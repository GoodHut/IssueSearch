 URL : "https://github.com/resin-os/resinos/issues/216" TITLE : resinos website title BODY : the template for the resinos website capitalizes the repo.name in the <title> , header, resulting in resinos , while the opengraph title is not capitalized so shown as resinos . https://github.com/resin-os/resinos/blob/46e9ab919b9cbd716e8c8ae4a68c3ba6755cea23/templates/default.html l6-l7 i'm guessing it would be better to show the title as used, that is resinos ?
