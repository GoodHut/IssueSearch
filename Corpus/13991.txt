 URL : "https://github.com/scottwhudson/metronome/issues/1" TITLE : add .wav file use BODY : this is a great start for a very useful and portable tool. i'd recommend looking at another open source metronome https://github.com/wilson428/metronome and reuse the missing parts, if possible. i like the mechanical click sound but am not sure how that would work with this metronome. i assume it would require different sound files for the different intervals + accent. as i'm mostly using the tick on 2 and 4, a single sound is enough for most of my practice. how would you go about implementing these? in a separate settings page? if i find some time aside from practice, i might get to add some functionality.
