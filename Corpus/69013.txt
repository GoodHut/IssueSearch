 URL : "https://github.com/JackyChiu/realworld-starter-kit/issues/12" TITLE : sql connection & go orm BODY : i'm quite new to using sql with go, so if anyone has any opinion or design proposals post them here! as of now: - the sql connection is global in the main package maybe switch to dependency injection to pass it around? - we're using gorm as our orm, maybe we don't need an orm and sqlx would be enough?
