 URL : "https://github.com/serratus/quaggaJS/issues/237" TITLE : limiting false positives BODY : during excessive testing i found that i get about 5 to 10 per cent false positives. what i do not get at all: false positives have a correct checksum – how can that be? anyway, i found out – and i do not think that this is documented - if you check the data.coderesult.startinfo.error value for 0 and reject any other result, the hit rate is close to a 100 percent.
