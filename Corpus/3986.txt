 URL : "https://github.com/hawkw/an-editor/issues/60" TITLE : add a makefile BODY : we are quite capable of building everything with cargo , but it might be nice to have an _optional_ makefile to automate complex stuff or tasks that require multiple cargo commands. some things i'd like to see in the makefile : - cargo test && cargo test --features unstable for testing with and without nightly-only features - cargo rustc --features clippy -- -z no-trans -z extra-plugins=clippy to lint not build the project with clippy https://github.com/manishearth/rust-clippy and with the compiler's lints + clippy would have to be added as an optional dependency https://github.com/manishearth/rust-clippy optional-dependency for this to work + this could be a make lint task that also lints with cargo fmt -- --write-mode=diff if rustfmt https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt is installed - a make task for doing the coverage task https://github.com/hawkw/an-editor/blob/master/.travis.yml l54-l70 from the travis config? unless we decide to split the rope and editor core repos 59 , the makefile would need to handle cd -ing into the an-rope https://github.com/hawkw/an-editor/blob/master/.travis.yml l40-l45 directory to run commands for the rope crate.
