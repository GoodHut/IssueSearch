 URL : "https://github.com/fsxfreak/club-suite/issues/254" TITLE : frontend pie chart order BODY : right now, the first pie chart is planned breakdown of expenses and the second is actual breakdown of expenses , but the table underneath it has spent first, then total budget , so maybe it would be more clearer if we flip the order of the pie charts? also can we rename the pie charts to be used expenses and planned expenses ? very low priority, ignore if u don't have time
