BODY : hello guys, i would really appreciate if some of you can test the current version properly and report potential bugs. i think if we adjust hints messages a little, it would be in quite usable state and we could make another release. then i sugguest to see if it has enough feedback so we know whether it is worth to add some extra features & spend more time on it. what do you think? thanks!
