 URL : "https://github.com/pyca/pynacl/issues/302" TITLE : libsodium slow build time BODY : hi, i am running into an issue where installing pynacl on a raspberry pi or in a multiarch docker container is very slow. by default, make https://github.com/pyca/pynacl/blob/master/setup.py l163 is run in one thread. compile times could be reduced substantially from >10 minutes to 1 minute in testing by passing -j4 or higher to make . would the maintainers entertain the idea of an environment variable such as libsodium_make_args which could be passed like libsodium_make_args=-j4 pip install pynacl ?
