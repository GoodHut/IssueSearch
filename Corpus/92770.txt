 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet/issues/467" TITLE : 403s on valid nuget config BODY : my environment - mac - sierra 10.12.6 - nuget install: /library/frameworks/mono.framework/versions/current/commands/nuget - nuget version: 4.3.0.4406 - .net command line tools 2.0.0 running dotnet restore, i am getting 403s when trying to resolve my dependencies. i have narrowed it down to this problem. when using multiple sources, and using disabledpackagesources , this somehow breaks everything. not only is the source that should be ignored used, no auth is sent with it. as a workaround i am having to comment out the source in my nuget config file, but this took me a while to hunt down and is a bug. > retrying 'findpackagesbyidasynccore' for source 'http://my.test.com/test/api/nuget/inin-nuget-local/findpackagesbyid ?id='test.alliances.common''. > response status code does not indicate success: 403 forbidden . to recreate issue, register 2 sources that require authentication in your nuget config file. this could be the same nuget repo/url, with different source names. add one of the sources to the disabledpackagesources node <disabledpackagesources> <add key= myrepo1 value= true /> </disabledpackagesources> register credentials for both repos.. <packagesourcecredentials> <myrepo1> <add key= username value= username /> <add key= cleartextpassword value= pwd /> </myrepo1> <myrepo2> <add key= username value= username /> <add key= cleartextpassword value= pwd /> </myrepo2> </packagesourcecredentials> try to do a dotnet restore and watch the 403s fly by.
