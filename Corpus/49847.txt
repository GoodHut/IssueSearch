 URL : "https://github.com/exercism/gui/issues/53" TITLE : updating windows path BODY : hi, i posted a reply to https://github.com/exercism/exercism.io/issues/3077 issuecomment-290240995 a while back and @kytrinyx has asked me to move my question here: > i just have a question; is it supposed to add the exercism.exe to the path? it didn't on my machine and so adding c:\program files\exercism to the path would have to be documented also. i don't know any c but maybe this could become part of the installation in future versions? adding things to the windows path can often be a cause for mistakes for beginners, and tbh i'm still not immune from messing up my path!
