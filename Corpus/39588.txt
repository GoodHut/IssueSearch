 URL : "https://github.com/skibinska/xhr-workshop/issues/5" TITLE : slightly unclear aim BODY : hi, thanks for making this! we just did it today facn1 - one thing which i think could have been improved would be including an aim/a description of what we were aiming for at the top of the readme- as it wasn't particularly clear what we were supposed to be doing without inferring from the files. maybe you could change this before fac10 does it tomorrow if you want? i don't know whether this usually is the done thing, let me know if not!
