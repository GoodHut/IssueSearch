 URL : "https://github.com/numbbo/coco/issues/1492" TITLE : legend in scaling figures BODY : there has been a legend in the art vs dimension figures for the first and the last function in previous versions. i find the figures without a legend, e.g. here http://coco.gforge.inria.fr/github/issue00021/ppdata-expensive-refrsportfolio/rando_bipop_bfgs__smac-_lmm-c_hcma/ppfigs.html practically unreadable. i cannot remember the color of each algorithm by heart and the caption doesn't make it any easier, because it doesn't display the very same symbol different size, different thickness . even if it were the same symbol, scrolling back and forth to find out which is which algorithm is not a useful mode of operation for me.
