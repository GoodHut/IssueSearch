 URL : "https://github.com/cazala/synaptic/issues/257" TITLE : not an issue BODY : this is not an issue. since data normalization is probably the biggest challenge for beginners such as myself , i'd like to submit a code to the community to be integrated int the normalization 101 wiki if appropriate . the class sorry, this is typescript !!! converts any training input data into bits of array. ths gist: https://gist.github.com/adadgio/ce54cba2d3f9b953924aa3be497259bb https://gist.github.com/adadgio/ce54cba2d3f9b953924aa3be497259bb usage: let analyzer = new databitsanalyzer originaldata ; analyzer.setoutputproperties 'water' ; analyzer.normalize ; let nbrinputs = analyzer.getinputlength ; console.log nbr of inputs: ${nbrinputs} ; let inputs = analyzer.getbinaryinputdataset ; let outputs = analyzer.getbinaryoutputdataset ; console.log inputs ; console.log outputs ; just hoping to contribute here.
