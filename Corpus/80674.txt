 URL : "https://github.com/metafizzy/isotope/issues/1264" TITLE : unusual spacing behavior BODY : @desandro everything works as expected when using the filters https://www.usarugby.org/events-calendar/ filter=.wpcm_match , however, when trying to view all items https://www.usarugby.org/events-calendar/ filter=.event , the spacing acts very unusual. i've never seen this kind of behavior before. wondering if you had any ideas?
