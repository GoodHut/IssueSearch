 URL : "https://github.com/JeffersonLab/hps-java/issues/102" TITLE : create event mixing tool BODY : create tool that allows sampling different of event streams into a single output event at different rates. for instance, it should support overlay of tritrig every 250 events over wab-beam. this would be designed to replace the filtermcbunches tool which is currently used for a similar purpose but is much less flexible.
