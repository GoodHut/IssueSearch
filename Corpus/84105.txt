 URL : "https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/issues/8345" TITLE : cq controls -- stop/start BODY : feature request __proposal: once continuous queries cqs are created there is no way to halt them...other than via the drop command. this then requires a re-creation of the continuous query -- to get going again. ideally, cqs would allow for some finer-grained controls -- such as stop/start to allow the administrator with flexibility in terms of halting their execution. __current behavior: create continuous query.... creates the cq and starts it. drop continuous query is the only way to halt its execution. __desired behavior: create continuous query would create and activate the query, as it does today. but, new commands would be introduced to allow for the query to be halted...and re-started. stop continuous query <name> start continuous query <name> this would prevent the user from having to drop and then re-load the entire query. __use case: there are situations where the cq should be halted temporarily and then re-started.
