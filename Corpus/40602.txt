 URL : "https://github.com/interledgerjs/ilp-kit-docker-compose/issues/15" TITLE : update to ilp-kit 4. BODY : currently, this repo uses ilp-kit 3. more precisely, it uses interledgerjs/ilp-kit release in version 4. , the nginx conf for ilp-kit has changed: https://github.com/interledgerjs/ilp-kit/blob/master/docs/nginx.md we should update https://github.com/interledgerjs/ilp-kit-docker-compose/blob/master/nginx-letsencrypt-proxy/site.conf to reflect that. maybe we can do this at the same time as adding btp support.
