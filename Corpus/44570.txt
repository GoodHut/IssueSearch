 URL : "https://github.com/cantino/huginn/issues/1903" TITLE : feathub for requests? BODY : in the past we've used the issue tracker for feature/agent requests, ideas, suggestion, etc. and while in some places it's good those that get actively discussed/worked on , in a lot of other ways it tends to clutter up the issues with things that might not have much interest, or that just end up falling to the wayside. i was thinking it would be cool to make use of a 'proper' feature tracker, one that lets users vote, etc. just stumbled upon http://feathub.com/ through another project, and thinking maybe it could be used for this. interested to hear everones thoughts. ping @cantino, @knu, @dsander
