 URL : "https://github.com/MrMimic/MEDOC/issues/4" TITLE : db not being created BODY : when parsing the sql file to create the db, the script silently fails to create it because it tries to execute it line by line. trying to execute comments and newline fails. see this line https://github.com/mrmimic/medoc/blob/master/medoc.py l66 as a temporary solution one could do: python for command in open self.parameters 'database' 'path_to_sql' , 'r' : if command != ' ' and not command.startswith ' ' : cursor.execute command again, this solution is available in my pull request, if accepted.
