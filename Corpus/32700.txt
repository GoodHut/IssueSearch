 URL : "https://github.com/kriasoft/react-static-boilerplate/issues/268" TITLE : weird caching issue BODY : how to reproduce: - open incognito; - go to https://www.freereikicourse.com/advanced_practitioner_level_2_12.html/ - you will see no flicker - refresh any other page and starts flickering. i think the service worker or something like that is caching the homepage and serving that html for all other pages. obviously something is messed up. why do we need that service worker anyway?
