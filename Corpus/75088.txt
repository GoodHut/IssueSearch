 URL : "https://github.com/simonfuhrmann/mve/issues/386" TITLE : gcps for georeferencing? BODY : does mve support using gcps ground control points to increase precision of the models? my research focus on deriving terrain models from uav images and we use dgps to get precise coordinates of targets on the ground which we can use in photoscan/etc. mve seems very promising and this would be a very important feature for us.
