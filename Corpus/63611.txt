 URL : "https://github.com/ubports/ubports-touch/issues/191" TITLE : enhancement: night mode BODY : the screen is quite intense at night time. things like the scopes, twitter app, dekko and more have mostly white on their ui. waiting for all apps to implement a night mode podbird has one and reddit.com provides one too would take a long time - could it be provided as a switch in the notification area? with compiz config settings manager i can use super+m to invert the colours of the entire ubuntu desktop. it would be great to have this feature on the phone to prevent hurting our eyes at night.
