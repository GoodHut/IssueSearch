 URL : "https://github.com/alvarcarto/url-to-pdf-api/issues/7" TITLE : insufficient url checking BODY : i think it might be a good idea to restrict urls to http:// and https:// protocols. the current demo allows file:// type urls and can therefore be used to read information from the file system. try for example https://url-to-pdf-api.herokuapp.com/api/render?url=file:///etc/passwd there might be issues with other protocols as well. i only tested file:// urls.
