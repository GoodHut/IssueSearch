 URL : "https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/3556" TITLE : local yarn configurations BODY : this is a feature proposal. currently yarn configuration is global. e.g. yarn config list and yarn config set version-tag-prefix will affect how yarn operates on the users system. i proposal that these instead affect local configuration just like add et al. do. configuring global configuration would changed to be consistent with how it works for said add et al, e.g.: yarn global add ... . this would have the benefit of allowing different standards co-exist on the users system. for example some projects might standardize on a v prefix before version numbers while others do not. or varying standards around the version commit message itself. it would also allow teams to ensure all collaborators have configuration parity without any overhead. i'm sure there are other use cases. am i the only one with this use case? thoughts?
