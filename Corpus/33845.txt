 URL : "https://github.com/aptalca/docker-rdp-calibre/issues/19" TITLE : auto import of books BODY : have everything setup and working fine, all initial problems proved to be permission errors running on synology although using linuxserver.io docker images with pgid permissions proved to be very easy setup - any plans to use this method? but i cannot get calibre to auto import books, import folder is set to /books and i can manually import from this folder using the add books menu...i restarted calibre as advised but nothing changed. any ideas?
