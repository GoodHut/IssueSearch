 URL : "https://github.com/Azure-Samples/powerbi-node-server-express/issues/2" TITLE : cross domain erros BODY : hi everyone, i'm a powerbi and node.js develloper in brazil and in follow video, you consume data from this uri : https://github.com/azure-samples/powerbi-dotnet-server-aspnet-web-api. i am consuming from https://github.com/azure-samples/powerbi-node-server-express which i complied easily in my local enviroment localhost:3000 ... then, i built same sample which you showed in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fchedsz8u28&t=810s embedding basics using bower and localhost:8080 from http-server . but, when i had build a bower client that consumes that uri localhost:3000 , i had a cross domain error response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: no 'access-control-allow-origin' header is present on the requested resource. origin 'http://localhost:8080' is therefore not allowed access. . did not it happen with you ? note: when i use your uri https://powerbiembedapinode.azurewebsites.net/ it works very well, and i have not any problem with cross domain. and i have tried cors and jsonp, no success hehe!
