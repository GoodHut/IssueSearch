 URL : "https://github.com/w3c/manifest/issues/587" TITLE : too many icons BODY : i think that the current state of the specification is unnecessarily complex. you can define multiple icons, and you also have to manually type the size of each icon in the manifest. first. i think the size should be removed. the size can be obtained by the user-agent by actually downloading the icon. in time of streaming of 4k videos it should not be a big deal. next, i think that multiple icons are not necessary. the author should provide just a single icon in any but usually high resolution and the user agent will adapt it according to the actual needs of the device. having the possibility of multiple icons is confusing. app makers will not be sure which dimensions should they have. and user agents will be confused, which resolution to use, when the required is not present. and trying to define a must-have icon of e.g. 128x128px is also wrong from a long-time perspective. for example, i use 512x512 px icon for my webapp photopea: https://www.photopea.com/pp_icon.png , which is just 10 kb.
