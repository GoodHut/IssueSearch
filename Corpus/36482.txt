BODY : hello, would be awesome if you could cover the best practices for svg combining. it looks like it is possible to combine multiples svg into one, and to query them this way: - my-combined-svg my-id i'm wondering if this is possible to do everything this way like on a regular svg, and if there's any downside people might need to know if choosing such a method. combining could also make it possible to compile like we're doing with js and css assets. being able to declare many svg when developing, and compile to only one sounds cool :
