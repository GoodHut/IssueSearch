 URL : "https://github.com/cvdlab/react-planner/issues/88" TITLE : wall design improvements BODY : when designing walls i think it would be nice if: + the walls could be described as __paths instead of segments__, so after the first one, each ending vertex will be the starting one for the next wall. + the grid could be used to __snap vertices__ when closer than a threshold. + when inserting items the right mouse button could be used to __pan into the map__ so it's no more necessary to change tool just to move few pixels away and then to take the insertion tool back. + when switching in 3d mode the __camera origin__ could be the area's centroid instead of 0,0 , even better the scene's centroid. great job btw!
