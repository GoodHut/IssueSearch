 URL : "https://github.com/choojs/bankai/issues/292" TITLE : eaddrinuse silent fail BODY : hi, i've nginx setup on the port 8080 . when i use bankai start it silently fails onexit doesn't check if the argument is an error, which is given by uncaughtexception for example with a code of 0 . i'm not sure why getport used in lib/cmd-start doesn't give the correct port, access rights are correct. looks like we're going through this line https://github.com/mikeal/getport/blob/master/index.js l21 in my context. you may want to switch to get-port https://github.com/sindresorhus/get-port instead?
