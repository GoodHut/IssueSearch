 URL : "https://github.com/UCL-CloudLabs/Deployer/issues/3" TITLE : add logging functionality BODY : at the moment we are using prints and python-terraform https://github.com/beelit94/python-terraform terraform-output 's streamed output to stdout/stderr. note python-terraform works in two different modes: capturing all the output from terraform in a single variable - bad idea since the deployment takes several minutes around 5-8 mins and the user will see nothing while this is happening. streaming the output as sent by terraform - the way we have it now. we need to figure out how to redirect this to something we can parse into a deployment status the front end can use to inform the user on progress. in case of error when streaming, python-terraform doesn't save the error message sent by terraform, making it impossible to tell the user why a deployment failed.
