 URL : "https://github.com/Hyrules/VueHue/issues/1" TITLE : run, and editing BODY : i know it's experimental, but i can't get it to work at all... running npm run dev , it builds and opens, but i can't see any bulbs - how to pair my bridge? also, could you tell me where the files are that control the design e.g. the view source that i can see when it's running in chrome thanks, i know it may not be worth much time at this early experimental stage but i'll give it a shot!
