 URL : "https://github.com/kimwalisch/libpopcnt/issues/2" TITLE : other boolean operations? BODY : sorry, this is not an issue actually, just a naive question: popcnt usually goes together with other boolean operations. i am wondering what your opinion on these is: shall i just run the as a normal loop over the whole array, one byte a time because they're already quite fast . or do you recommend a library with avx-? optimized versions of and/or/xor etc on the array? btw, with g++ 4.4.7 from 2010, the benchmark file just crashes with illegal instruction . not a problem, i just had to update my g++. thanks! max
