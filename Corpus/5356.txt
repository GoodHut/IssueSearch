 URL : "https://github.com/rails/webpacker/issues/505" TITLE : no source maps BODY : if i create a project using for example rails new myapp --webpack=react doesn't matter if i use react or vue and then run ./bin/webpack-dev-server or ./bin/webpack it should generate source map files besides of the js files, right? i'm using rails 5.1.1 and with the default configuration it doesn't create any source map files. what do i have to change to get source maps?
