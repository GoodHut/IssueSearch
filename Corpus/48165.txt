 URL : "https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/issues/6979" TITLE : rename barrier module BODY : summary of problem the barrier module has a record named barrier and its constructor proc barrier . this creates major issues as can be seen in the source code sample. although this brings up the possibility of user writing such a module and trying to use it in this fashion, i think the barrier module should be renamed until the fundamental issue is fixed in a more principled way. steps to reproduce source code: chapel module foo { use barrier; } use foo; use barrier; compile command: chpl foo.chpl results in: foo.chpl:2: error: 'use' of non-module/enum symbol barrier $chpl_home/modules/standard/barriermodule.chpl:68: error: definition of symbol barrier configuration information - output of chpl --version : chpl version 1.16.0 pre-release a9493a6b17
