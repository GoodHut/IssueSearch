BODY : let pretend developer created usual static html page. this page contains element showing phone number. this number is marked by semantic schema as phone. this number is marked by attribute myusereditabletag. when user opens file via aintcms he may edit phone marked by usereditabletag as phone. nothing else. does it makes sense? also page would have paragraph element on page. it marked as custom attribute maxlength 400 and usereditabletag text. opening in aintcms allows to edit and git push.
