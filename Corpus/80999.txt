BODY : i'm trying to use this plugin outside of kodi. primarily, it seems you have done a fair amount of research into what calls need to be made, and how they all interact/what headers are needed/etc. i'm trying to determine how to utilize this to get a stream that i can send to my chromecast. there are other python libraries that handle sending the stream over to the cast, but i need to be able to figure out what the correct urls are to use.
