 URL : "https://github.com/eeue56/elm-html-test/issues/14" TITLE : svg attribute testing? BODY : does this test library also support testing svg view attributes? say i have this svg: elm viewimage : int -> int -> string -> svg msg viewimage width height url = image attr.width tostring width , attr.height tostring height , attr.xlinkhref url the xlink:href attribute does not show up in the failed test. ! image https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3099999/25211317/8f3c4750-2539-11e7-9c56-6f7ab23795b7.png perhaps this is just a bug with certain svg attributes, and if so i can rename this issue/try to make a pr to fix the behavior.
