 URL : "https://github.com/den-materials/project-4/issues/4" TITLE : heroku status 500 error BODY : i'm getting a server 500 error when my app redirects to the home page after login/registration on heroku. it works on my local host, and the login/register worked prior to my latest update. heroku logs don't display any error info, other than the status 500. i've already tried going through heroku's docs on debugging and routing for php. haven't had any luck yet, and would love to get a fresh set of eyes on this. i've talked to corey to try and work through this issue, but she wasn't sure where to check. i'm working on checking my response on the redirect route, but haven't gotten anything other than a 500 error in chrome yet.
