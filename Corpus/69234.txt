 URL : "https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge/issues/238" TITLE : support edits on gitter BODY : gateway config: <> discord <-> gitter <-> irc <>. when posting a message on discord, then editing it, the bot will post a new message on irc and gitter instead of modifying it. this behaviour is ok on irc, but gitter has the ability to edit a message; it'd be nice to get that supported!
