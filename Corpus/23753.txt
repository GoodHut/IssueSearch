 URL : "https://github.com/Epse/EpPos/issues/21" TITLE : refactor of orders BODY : orders will be changed to stay in the database forever as a means of being able to look at previous orders. they will get fleshed out more and instead of having a json array of product titles and id's, prices will be added as well. i can't just make the order store a list with product id's and quantitiies since an archived order may be made with different product pricing that the current.
