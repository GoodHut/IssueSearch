 URL : "https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen/issues/659" TITLE : long error messages BODY : first of all, thanks so much for your work on hydrogen. it works brilliantly and it's so much easier to code vs. jupyter notebook in a browser. i have two quick questions regarding big output windows. ! screenshot from 2017-03-23 14-50-14 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18163728/24233847/06d5126e-0fd8-11e7-9794-99c037765eac.png 1 the output window is narrower when minimap is on, but for people with minimap autohider, the window overlaps with the minimap when it is visible. any way to force the window to always be narrower even if minimap is set to autohide? 2 i used the code below to disable scrollbars don't find them useful at all but it also disables scrollbar in the hydrogen output. any tweaks/shortcuts to scroll down to the bottom of a long message without the scrollbar? not sure how much work it would be to add a button to do this. ::-webkit-scrollbar { display: none; } many thanks for your help!
