 URL : "https://github.com/stonesam92/SSSnackbar/issues/11" TITLE : crash at launch BODY : i have some code that may attempt to display sssnackbar at launch from -applicationdidfinishlaunching: . i'm ok with it not being able to display a message here, but instead it crashes. the problem is that in -show it assumes there's a rootviewcontroller : uiviewcontroller topcontroller = uiapplication sharedapplication .keywindow.rootviewcontroller; if this is nil, bad things happen. i think it just needs a check for nil here. it could return without displaying anything.
