BODY : hello, i tried your bundle, and that wasn't working : all the .conf files were created, but the consumers were not working... then after some reading, i tried to install supervisor program via apt-get install supervisor , and then the consumers were working, but the rebuild comment didn't gave me the terminal back.... moreover ctrl + c isn't working. i got few questions, please : - i supervisor bin really needeed ? if yes, i think you sould update the doc - is it a normal behavior that the rebuild command seems not finishing ? thank you for your answer and your work.
