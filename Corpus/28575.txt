 URL : "https://github.com/mapbox/watchbot-progress-py/issues/3" TITLE : handle job failures BODY : currently when a part of a job fails, the entire job is marked as failed and no subsequent parts will be processed. two potential issues with this: the part may succeed if retried for example, intermittent aws failures if one part fails, reprocessing the entire job means duplicated work. depending on the nature of the job, we may want to keep processing subsequent parts and have some sort of requeue mechanism and/or a retry on individual jobs.
