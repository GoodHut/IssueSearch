 URL : "https://github.com/civetweb/civetweb/issues/424" TITLE : question: serve html file BODY : i am using civetweb embedded into my exe. i would like to serve an html file that needs other files such as an image file. how i return the first html file to the requester is as follow: int webuihandler struct mg_connection conn, void cbdata { / handler may access the request info using mg_get_request_info / const struct mg_request_info req_info = mg_get_request_info conn ; int returncode = request_ok; std::string requestmethod = req_info->request_method; std::string requestedcommand = req_info -> local_uri; if requestmethod.compare get == 0 { const char filename = const char index.shtml ; mg_send_file conn, filename ; } else { mg_printf conn, http_notallowederrorheader.c_str ; returncode = request_not_supported; // not supported request } return returncode; } i get the sense that i am doing sth wrong since my images do not show. or simply any other file such as css, js, etc. is not downloaded by the browser . i would be happy if you could point me to the right direction.
