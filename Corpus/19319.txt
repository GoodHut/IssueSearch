 URL : "https://github.com/vigetlabs/microcosm/issues/217" TITLE : a better presenter BODY : @mackermedia and i have been talking about how we could make the presenter more general, better for rendering within itself. here's our current draft: javascript class mypresenter extends presenter { // model has been renamed to getmodel. the signature // has been updated to be more consistent with other hooks getmodel repo, props, state { return { ... bindings } } // presenters can pass a view property, or implement a render method // this.model points to the latest model render { const { computedprop } = this.model return <p>{computedprop}</p> } } @mackermedia feel free to keep riffing. i just don't want to lose the conversation
