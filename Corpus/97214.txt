 URL : "https://github.com/CIDRAM/CIDRAM/issues/46" TITLE : frequently asked questions BODY : anyone up for reviewing the faq section of the documentation? ..or any parts of the documentation, for that matter. mostly just thinking of the faq at the moment due to that i added a new entry to it earlier today about infractions , and so, it's fresh on my mind. would love to know whether others think it all makes sense, whether they think it needs improving, whether there's anything missing that they can think of that should be added and so on. review and prs are invited.
