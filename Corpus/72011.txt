 URL : "https://github.com/gwern/gwern.net/issues/12" TITLE : articles break in pocket BODY : if you try to save http://www.gwern.net/causality, pocket https://getpocket.com will only save the quotes from the appendix. haven't tried it elsewhere, but it's possible this will also be a problem for screenreaders and other parsers. i suspect this is because the site isn't using article or header tags anywhere. for example, you have: <div id= header > <h1>why correlation usually â‰  causation: causal nets cause common confounding</h1> </div> there's no way for pocket or any parser to know that this is actually the header of the article, rather than, say, an unrelated sidebar. this is compounded because you're using repeated h1 tags, so even naive document outline parsing won't help it's totally valid to use multiple h1 tags, but not many browsers, screenreader, etc... actually pay attention to that part of the spec i'm not completely sure, but if you switched from <div id= main > to <main> , <div id= header > <header> , and <div id= content > to <article> , that might be all you need to get everything working.
