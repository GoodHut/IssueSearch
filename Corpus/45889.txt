 URL : "https://github.com/Neo23x0/Loki/issues/71" TITLE : is yara link correct? BODY : you link to a fork of yara that at this point is quite old â€“ should i be using that link or the up-to-date version from virustotal's github? i've tried both and neither will build on macos, so i filed an issue on the virustotal repo's page. really looking forward to using this on macos i hope! . thank you!
