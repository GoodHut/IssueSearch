BODY : your environment version used: master branch platform used: javascript rendering engine used: svg browser name and version: chrome 59.0.3071.115 build officiel 64 bits operating system and version desktop or mobile : windows 10 expected results i have a file input for entering a guitar pro file. i load the file in alphatab when the input changes. i order to validate the file, i need to catch the potential import errors from alphatab. the api could trigger the alphatab.error event when an error occurs. something like this: js at.on 'alphatab.error', function e, data { if data.msg === importerror ... } observed results the errors seem to be just printed in the console. steps to reproduce for bugs load a non valid file and try to be notified by some error. possible solution here is what i did: https://github.com/j4kim/alphatab/commit/54ddd85d81443f5653d344a78aa4dca093a8e1d4 added manually a throw statement on the failure callback of the fileloader methods. it does the job in most cases but there are inconveniences: i have to maintain an other version up to date, which i found out today is not easy it doesn't even catch all the import errors, some files pass through this trick text files mostly . i think i am not throwing errors in all cases... well, it's not a good solution.
