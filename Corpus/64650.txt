 URL : "https://github.com/DataONEorg/rdataone/issues/190" TITLE : harden d1 service calls BODY : all of the calls to dataone services check the return status code and return an error based on the returned xml that contains the dataone error description. however, it is assumed that the xml returned from successful calls is valid, and no checks are made for either invalid xml or parsing errors, which can occasionally occur. harden the calls that parse returned xml by surrounding the parsing code in a try block and return a useful error message if there is an error in parsing, e.g. error parsing the dataone response for service x: <some description> . any service that parses xml should be updated more of them do , e.g. getsystemmetadata , getobject , etc.
