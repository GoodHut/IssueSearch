 URL : "https://github.com/irods/irods/issues/3568" TITLE : ticket host restriction BODY : hi all, i've been working with tickets for a few days and i noticed that you are allowed to use hostnames to restrict access on a ticket using the iticket mod command . however, if you inspect a ticket, you'll see that the host's ip address is used instead of its hostname. well... i'm not sure if i got the point of using ips instead of hostnames, but i can see some problems with this approach: - the user will have to know the ip address of the host in order to check if tickets restrictions are correct - i have to update the ticket with the new host's ip address every time the ip changes - if the ip addresses change another user may now be able to access files/collections in irods with the ticket id and path in hands these are problems that make ticket host restrictions quite difficult to work with. like i said before, i may not have understood the advantages of using ip addresses over hostnames, but i thought it was worth to talk about. cheers!
