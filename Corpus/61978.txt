 URL : "https://github.com/Mrigank11/embetacloud/issues/26" TITLE : can u add this feature. BODY : hey was just thinking that if you can add the feature to split the downloaded files in part and then to upload it to gdrive/mega. because many of the torrents are quite large and cannot be uploaded to the cloud services so,is it possible to add it like splitting the zipped files into part.
