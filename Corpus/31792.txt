 URL : "https://github.com/poteto/ember-changeset/issues/256" TITLE : support nested keys BODY : ember-changeset 1.4.0+ adds support for nested keys. however, the latest minor release 1.4.1 also breaks existing apis, and introduces bugs because not all changeset methods have been updated to support nested keys. thus, you should not use ember-changeset 1.4.0+, nor should you point your package.json at the latest commit on master . instead, please pin your ember-changeset version to 1.3.0 : js { dependencies : { ember-changeset : 1.3.0 } } if you're using ember-changeset-validations e-c-v , you should also pin e-c-v's version to 1.2.8 : js { dependencies : { ember-changeset : 1.3.0 , ember-changeset-validations : 1.2.8 } } the develop/nested-keys https://github.com/poteto/ember-changeset/tree/develop/nested-keys branch contains ongoing work on nested keys support. we'll make a formal announcement when a bugfix release is ready.
