 URL : "https://github.com/babun/babun/issues/783" TITLE : can't access my files BODY : hello everyone! i need your help. i'm just now starting unix and terminal lessons. i started using the terminal on windows and quickly realized much of the inputs in the lessons did not work for a terminal set on windows. babun came as highly recommended and i tried it out. after installing though i haven't been able to access any of my files. for instance i can't access my desktop files, it returns no such file or directory. how do i make this work? sorry for the bother, but i'm really inexperienced when it comes to this stuff. i appreciate any help you can give me, thanks.
