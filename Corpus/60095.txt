 URL : "https://github.com/zoom/api/issues/21" TITLE : what are virtual hosts BODY : hi @ joshuawoodward, i'm working to implement the zoom api with a client product. going over the documentation, and api i still miss some crucial information how to create a proper meeting. i fail to understand what is a virtual host . my questions are: - what is a virtual host? - how should it be used? another thing, what should be proper way to make a meeting. my clients have 2 scenarios: - 1 on 1 , when two people want to just have a video chat - many people , when more the 2 people have to discuss something. in both cases should i just use the meeting api? and also: - why do i have to provide a host_id , the user of my clients don't have a zoom account nor we want them to force them to make one. right now i use the host_id of my client, but then i get a message that the host has not joined yet, and the users are confused. before i finish, - how long will the video recordings stay on your servers? is there a limit? - do i have to delete a meeting when the webhook tells me it is over? this is all the info that i miss from the documentation, i hope you can shad some light, so i can understand exactly how to take advantage of zoom. david.
