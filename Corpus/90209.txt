 URL : "https://github.com/sneakypete81/updatescanner/issues/165" TITLE : scan list has disappeared BODY : firefox version: 57.0 and now 57.0.1 both 32 bit update scanner version: 4.1.0 update scanner was working for days. then, when i selected the option scan all pages tonight, there were no changes. thinking this suspicious, i went to the firefox sidebar. under update scanner, it now says can't see your scan list? upgrade to upgrade scanner 4. i can speculate as to what would cause this, but i did spend a lot of time recently configuring the brief extension, which also uses firefox's bookmarks, including adding a new feed or two to brief by having firefox detect it through its bookmark menu. the folder update scanner's pages still exists in the bookmarks, with a list of the pages i've been scanning. disabling and reenabling, and deleting and reinstalling update scanner don't help.
