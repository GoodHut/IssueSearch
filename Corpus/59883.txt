 URL : "https://github.com/jacobrosenthal/node-newtmgr/issues/11" TITLE : utilize yargs features BODY : it uses a library called yargs http://yargs.js.org/docs/ could you add some descriptions and other niceties so you can do --verison, --help, get a list of commands, etc any cool stuff you see in docs you want to implement keep your commits to generally one feature so theres a nice log of what each feature needed after a feature works, commit it we could at that point say you should work in seperate branches, but thats ok well just have feature per commit right now
