 URL : "https://github.com/JuliaPOMDP/DESPOT.jl/issues/23" TITLE : testing for action == -1 BODY : there is some code in despot.jl that checks for action == -1 to decide what to do next. i am assuming that this is indicating some sort of exceptional circumstance. this is problematic for a couple reasons i'm sure these have been considered but just haven't been fixed yet . 1 there could be problems for which -1 is a valid action, and 2 if the actions are not integers, there could be type stability issues. we should fix this eventually, perhaps by having the functions return a nullable{a} .
