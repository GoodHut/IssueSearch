 URL : "https://github.com/amplab/spark-ec2/issues/95" TITLE : submitting to ec2 cluster BODY : i'm surprised that i wasn't able to find spark-submit anywhere on the master. what are other folks doing to submit to spark when using spark-ec2? using an external system with it's own spark package to remotely spark-submit ? how would that work for code deployed and disseminated across the cluster?
