 URL : "https://github.com/benbalter/wordpress-to-jekyll-exporter/issues/112" TITLE : export fails from safari BODY : plug-in fails using safari browser. repro steps: 1. execute plug-in from wp tools menu and wait while it churns away. 2. not that downloads occurs very quickly. 3. safari claims that failed to decompress zip contents. 4. observe that actual file is 0 bytes. i executed same steps from windows using chrome and the plug-in worked, so not an issue with the wp plug-in install. thanks for writing this awesome plug-in. it otherwise works as hoped and you saved me days of work!! -roland.
