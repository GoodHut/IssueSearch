 URL : "https://github.com/cessen/ropey/issues/1" TITLE : lower memory overhead BODY : although the memory overhead for creating new ropes from existing text is quite good < 30% , the memory overhead from building up a rope from many small insertions is worse 30% < overhead < 100% . improving this would be great! the main culprit here is that since leaf nodes generally have a fixed-size text buffer, leaf nodes that aren't maximally filled contain wasted space. trying to keep leaf nodes close to maximally filled should resolve the memory overhead back down to around 30%. but how to do that without negatively impacting performance too much?
