 URL : "https://github.com/tetranz/select2entity-bundle/issues/60" TITLE : feature cache clear option BODY : the cache option is very useful, however on some occasions it is necessary to clear the cache e.g. if we know that the remote data has changed . currently the only way is to set extremely low cache timeout or to disable cache entirely. it would be great to have a function that would clear the cache on demand. example call: $element.select2entity clear-cache ;
