BODY : hello draco team and thank you for this great work. i'm noticing that the compression sometimes happens to output unexpected results : the following image represents the result of a conversion, it has many holes and shifted polys indices. ! compression? https://img4.hostingpics.net/pics/883874capturedcrande20171110161750.png is this an identified problem ? is it always to be expected ? is there a way to avoid it or to predict it ? thanks.
