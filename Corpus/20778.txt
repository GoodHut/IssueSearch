 URL : "https://github.com/karlch/vimiv/issues/54" TITLE : cropping of images BODY : i got this feature request per email, main usecase is cropping images quickly after taking a screenshot. the idea is to enter a crop mode which displays a rectangle to crop the image to. the nodes of the rectangle can be moved with hjkl for small steps and hjkl for large steps, possibly other keybindings for things like halfing/doubling the size and so forth. the nodes can be switched via tab and shift-tab . pressing return applies the crop and returns to image mode. the feature sounds really cool but i have no idea how difficult this would be. if it is too difficult it will not be implemented.
