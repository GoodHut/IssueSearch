 URL : "https://github.com/jnormington/dotdiff/issues/15" TITLE : not working with jruby BODY : jruby doesn't support rmagick read here https://github.com/jruby/jruby/wiki/c-extension-alternatives but it does offer alternatives: rmagick4j https://github.com/serabe/rmagick4j . i guess it shouldn't be too hard to check the runtime and require only the gem for the specific platform. can you do that?
