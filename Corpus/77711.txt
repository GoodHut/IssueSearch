 URL : "https://github.com/frankiesardo/icepick/issues/101" TITLE : not working on fragments BODY : the docs are saying this library is compatible with fragments but i can't make it work on my project. i'm simply defining my variable as : @state string test; after doing so, inside the methods onsaveinstance and oncreateview i'm saving/restoring using the methods provided by icepick class. to take out the doubt, i've manually defined at my bundle the variable and it has worked like a charm. is there something missing?
