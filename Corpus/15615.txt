 URL : "https://github.com/NEU-Libraries/scholar-onesearch/issues/316" TITLE : export to easybib BODY : apologies if this has already been discussed. the new ui has an option to export citations to easybib. while we have many students who have used easybib in their pre-nu careers, we don't officially support easybib. should we offer this option or hide it?
