 URL : "https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer-rails/issues/127" TITLE : update metadata :map BODY : autoprefixer has support for sourcemaps but in sprockets 4.x there is a metadata :map onto which we tap with jekyll-assets for efficiency , we then transform that, update the file names and spit it out as a .map file, this works quite well, because sprockets itself even updates it as it uglifies, or uses css. it would be nice if autoprefixer also did this, this way our maps don't potentially end up out of sync.
