 URL : "https://github.com/mintty/wsltty/issues/40" TITLE : home folder setting BODY : where does the home environment get set to %localappdata%\wsltty\home\%username% ? i am running into minor issues now that it is possible to execute windows binaries from wsl. example: if i start visual studio code from wsl, it inherits the home environment, but the windows git it executes expects the home to be set to %userprofile% or empty and then it defaults it to %userprofile , so now this process can't find ssh keys while running git. is it possible to unset the wsltty specific home environment variable before executing into wsl?
