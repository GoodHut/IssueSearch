 URL : "https://github.com/pauldendulk/Mapsui/issues/239" TITLE : wms on mobile devices BODY : my current project requires using wms to retrieve data from geoserver; i practised doing this using a wpf. once i was happy with how to retrieve data using the wms provider i started working on my xamarin application and realise that the wms provider does not exist. is there another way of retrieving wms using mapsui?
