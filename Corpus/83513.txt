 URL : "https://github.com/mapsam/callgraph/issues/1" TITLE : categorize lines & counts BODY : the count processes have common themes or at least strings of text that, if we put some collective knowledge together, we could make a little more digestible. if we start looking for commonalities like mutex or __uv_wait we can start pinning different filters to processes and threads that we want to show or hide. the main goal being to view only the processes specific to your application.
