 URL : "https://github.com/Komodo/KomodoEdit/issues/3361" TITLE : code completion in python3 BODY : short summary code autocompletion appears not to be parsing anything but the built-in libraries from python. komodo 10 still working fine for this. steps to reproduce running komodo ide 11 on a windows machine have not tested on other operating systems . expected results i was expecting autocompletion to show up for python packages like numpy and pandas that were installed after python. actual results i can see autocomplete for packages like tty and math that came with the python installation, but get nothing from packages that were pip3 installed. i already checked the __file__ value for packages that are loading properly and found that the libraries were being loaded from the expected location. platform information komodo edit or ide? ide komodo version? 11.01 operating system and version ? windows 10 latest
