 URL : "https://github.com/DBN16CO/Tactics/issues/195" TITLE : need controller superclss BODY : in pr 194 we had to change the following in each of the controller classes: // runs when the app is closed - attempt to close the websocket cleanly +	void onapplicationquit { + communicationmanager.ondisable ; +	} a better design would be to create a genericcontroller class which extends monobehavior and implements the above and any other shared functionality. that way each controller class could extend it.
