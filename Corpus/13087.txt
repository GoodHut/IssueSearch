 URL : "https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose-os/issues/252" TITLE : support for i2s? BODY : i don't think i've seen i2s support in mongoose-os. but, @cpq says here https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose-os/issues/203 that the native esp-idf sdk api is always available under mongooseos are there any examples of how to use the native esp-idf? if not, can you give some instructions? is it simply a matter of adding include driver/i2s.h ? is there a specific path to the headers?
