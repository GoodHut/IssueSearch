 URL : "https://github.com/AlexKokoz/AlexKokoz_Jammming/issues/6" TITLE : feature request review BODY : this was one of the shorter feature request docs that i've read and reviewed but this wasn't necessarily a bad thing. background: i felt like you could have elaborated a bit more on how you would implement this feature summary of the technical design portion . technical design: i understand that there isn't much to add in terms of code to accomplish this feature, therefore i felt like you could have shown the block of code you would have written for this determinekey method. caveat: felt like this section shouldn't have been blank as you could have addressed at least 1 caveat or potential ux problem in relation to your feature. like: upon pressing enter , does the value inside the input get reset or remain the same? why press enter at all and just do a live search function as you type? what would be the trade off between that and this? overall, simple feature request that fulfills the requirements but leaves the reader wanting more details. grade: meets expectation.
