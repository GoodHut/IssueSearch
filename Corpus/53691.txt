 URL : "https://github.com/tradle/react-native-udp/issues/41" TITLE : error in bind function BODY : in my app, i have configured things the folowing way: 1. when app opens, the first screen say startconfigscreen sets up a socket in componentdidmount as: > componentdidmount { > this.socketconn = dgram.createsocket 'udp4' ; > this.socketconn.bind 4210 ; > } and then closes it in componentwillunmount as: > componentwillunmount { > this.socketconn.close ; > cleartimeout this.rejectiontimeout ; > } 2 as soon as this component closes, another component say mainscreen creates and binds a socket on same port 4210, in same way as above code. this works perfectly fine, on android device, but on i s device i get the error: > error in bind function when app transitions from first to second screen. ! image https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17254413/23108297/5a627d32-f731-11e6-8d0e-f1f6e98ebc09.png however, when i dismiss the error and perform some action in the second screen, which sends some data over the udp socket, i get the following error: ! image https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17254413/23108307/96cd662e-f731-11e6-83df-4d62b1efdfdf.png as mentioned none of this happens on android physical device. do note, i am running on ios simulator in mac osx sierra.
