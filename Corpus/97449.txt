 URL : "https://github.com/Dragoon-Lab/topomath/issues/185" TITLE : graph tabs have no styling BODY : adding this for a last minute look before we do the final version... i believe this might have been the commit that fixed the tabs: https://github.com/dragoon-lab/laitsv3/commit/890aad1ceb2ce326512a46ba121b9919f44fc4cf line 6 of index.html adds this line <link rel= stylesheet href= ./dijit/themes/claro/claro.css > but somehow this commit got taken out of the history of index.html...maybe a bad merge or someone rebased by mistake at some point. in any case, how about we try adding this line back and see if it works?
