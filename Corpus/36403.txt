 URL : "https://github.com/vsch/idea-multimarkdown/issues/485" TITLE : header outline view? BODY : would it be possible to include a nice outline/navigation bar while editing markdown documents? e.g. this is from the typora markdown app: ! screenshot 2017-08-21 22 34 32 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/934140/29523918-04c8dc70-86c1-11e7-96fc-896e7becc553.png you can see on the left, it pulls out all the headers, arranges them in a nice tree, and highlights the one you are currently looking at. this makes it much easier to keep track of large documents, anything more than a few hundred lines of markdown.
