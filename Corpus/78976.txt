 URL : "https://github.com/rhash/RHash/issues/39" TITLE : request for sort options BODY : this is a really great program, thank you so much! i was wondering if there were sorting options, i don't seem to see any but maybe i've missed it. rhash sorts alphabetically ignoring case, which is much better than most hash software already thank you . it would be nice to have the ability to sort subdirectories first or last --dirsfirst or --dirslast when using the --recursive option. sorting by name case sensitive or not ,size,mtime,ctime,etc would be nice too, but sorting directories first or last would be really helpful with productivity. sorry if this option is present and i've overlooked it. and if it's something you're not interested in i can understand that. thank you again so much for this software, i really love it!
