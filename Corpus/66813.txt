 URL : "https://github.com/JuniperKernel/JuniperKernel/issues/6" TITLE : no output in jupyterlab BODY : thanks for the great work on this new kernel! @jasongrout told me about it yesterday, testing it today... using the current version of jlab 0.28.7, installed from conda-forge on osx, with chrome , i'm not getting any output to display. i opened the same notebook in both classic and lab and ran a simple cell with text in each, here's what happens: ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57394/32087911-23df31d4-ba94-11e7-9174-d701831c8df2.png now, the code is getting executed, i tested it by creating a variable in lab and then printing in the same session, next browser tab over , and it's been created: ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57394/32087939-60ec08b8-ba94-11e7-8b97-2190b3d41e5e.png so the issue seems specific to output display, not to code execution. in any case, if it's too early for you to look into jlab support, no worries. i'll use it with classic for now, but i figured i'd let you know. thanks again for the great work!
