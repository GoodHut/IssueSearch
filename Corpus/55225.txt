 URL : "https://github.com/cristim/autospotting/issues/171" TITLE : improve tagging system BODY : issue type - feature idea summary find better way to handle taging system - asynchronous for example. details the pricing system for aws lambda https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/ is based on the time spent at runtime by 100ms. and when we look at the tagging code https://github.com/cristim/autospotting/blob/687c852039cc2fea0b88b6b7d931626367a73094/core/spot_instance_request.go l111 we can directly see that we can spend up to 1 minute waiting/trying to tag an instance. 1 minute means 600 cycles of 100ms, so if we could find a better way to do so saving an artifact, making it asynchronous etc , that could save quite some time of execution. i'm not sure how possible that is to do so for now, but that seems like an obvious way to improve time performance of the project.
