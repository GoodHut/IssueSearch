 URL : "https://github.com/golang/dep/issues/417" TITLE : support empty projectroot BODY : _from @sdboyer on march 20, 2017 16:3_ golang/dep 313 highlighted an issue where things don't behave very well if projectroot is empty. this seems like a case we should explicitly support, though. this is kind of a stub issue for all that, but two quick thoughts: one set of work is refactoring listpackages and packagetree.toreachmap to work differently when the root is empty the other is changing the solver's root-project-checking behaviors to ensure everything matches up. _copied from original issue: sdboyer/gps 197_
