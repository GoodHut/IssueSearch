 URL : "https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/issues/419" TITLE : sass and ':global' error BODY : i'm probably just missing something here, but i've tried searching everywhere and can't find an answer or an example. how are you supposed to use the :global keyword in sass files? anytime i try to use it i get an error during webpack build of: error in ./src/assets/styles/global.sass module build failed: modulebuilderror: module build failed: :global .test ^ property global must be followed by a ':' are you not supposed to use this in sass files? if so, how do i declare a certain style to be global?
