 URL : "https://github.com/Ch3ck/Cameroon/issues/1" TITLE : twitter bot - customized BODY : you can use this since it's customized already rather than reinventing the wheel : . https://github.com/ch3nkula/wiki-twit-bot. it's customized and you can just put your preferred hash-tags in the text file hash-tags.txt and deploy. it's in node js except you want to build a different bot in a different technology. thanks @ch3ck.
