 URL : "https://github.com/translate/virtaal/issues/3267" TITLE : port to python 3 BODY : this project currently heavily relies on python 2 but a port to python 3 should be planned. python is still experiencing a long and sometimes painful migration progress. you all know that the python 2 end of support is announced in a few years, python 3 was released a long time ago and is pretty good now, and it seems that we recently reached that point where most new development is done with python 3 according to pycharm https://twitter.com/pycharm/status/865659029460209664 . i'd like to know what is the current status of the project regarding this port? is there some ongoing progress already? what are the dependencies not compatible with python 3? do you plan an incremental update with a library like six ? what are the components requiring the most work?
