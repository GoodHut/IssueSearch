 URL : "https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore/issues/325" TITLE : getstate vs. _getstate BODY : executor getstate manages the de-queue and the loading of states. per user request we need to eventually provide a way to simply load a state from a file/ and it needs 2 versions of it: getstate and _getstate one is synchronized via a lock and other other is not . this may be problematic and error prone.
