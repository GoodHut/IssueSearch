 URL : "https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js/issues/210" TITLE : dynamic marker detection BODY : i have a case where i need users to create their own custom markers and share them for others to scan. i would essentially need to post metadata of the detected marker or barcode first before returning the ar projection. in essence having to create a new <a-marker> dynamically. is there a way to return metadata from a ar.js marker or ar.js barcode without a pre-existing <a-marker> so i can use this to query a remote server? else, is there a way to embed meta in a .patt while creating custom markers, so i can read the meta and use it to query db.
