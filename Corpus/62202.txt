BODY : following on my mistake in 10, with the interpretation that even though i made a dumb mistake, it could be made more obvious in the future. i would prefer the workdir made by hatchery to be called build_hatchery . here were my thoughts that lead to this: - in .hatchery.work , .work seems like an extension and doesn't follow python conventions for separating words. .hatchery_work seems just as obvious for purpose but without deviating from other conventions - i don't think there is a compelling reason to make this a hidden directory. hatchery.work or hatchery_work seems equally easy to understand, yet does not require any special thought regarding ls etc. overall it seems like a directory users should be fully aware of, not one that is hidden from them. this is a judgment call... some tools, like tox , prefer to hide the working directory -- its work dir is .tox . but gradle uses build , node.js uses node_modules ... anyway this contributed to my mistake in 10 and could confuse other users in the future, not just exactly in the 10 case but in other cases where they might miss the hidden dir. - build is what gradle calls its working directory. why not call hatchery's directory something that fits well with that? build_hatchery ?
