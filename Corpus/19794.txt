 URL : "https://github.com/SOASTA/boomerang/issues/130" TITLE : adding global data BODY : i'm designated as a provider of boomerang to help other applications within my organization track client analytics. anyway i'm trying to give each customer a custom js file that has the startups and things they need so there's less thought and errors on their side getting things set up. one of the things i need is to be able to distinguish which application is sending me the data. right now i was able to hijack the properties array in boomerang.js to add a universal data attribute. that data attribute is then set in the init. however i noticed other plugins don't use the same event scheme that boomerang base does. clicks for example, has it's own way of sending events and doesn't seem to have access to the impl of boomerang. thus i had to modify that plugin as well to add an additional bit of data for the added field that's passed in the init . here's an example init: boomr.init { data: { appname: '%appname%', }, beacon_url: 'http://localhost:3000/beacon.gif', clicks: { click_url: 'http://localhost:3000/interaction.gif' } } the '%appname%' is populated by the grunt process. right now i mess with the clicks plugin as well to do something similar. is there an easy way to always pass a static bit of data regardless of the plugin or portion of this tool sending the data?
