 URL : "https://github.com/bradleyfalzon/gopherci/issues/127" TITLE : add unconvert tool. BODY : this is a proposal to add the unconvert tool to gopherci created by @mdempsky: https://github.com/mdempsky/unconvert i think it's helpful, produces accurate results, and fits in well next to unused and unparam that gopherci already supports. hopefully this is a less controversial change suggestion than 103; if it gets approval, i'd like to work on it, if no one else wants to take it.
