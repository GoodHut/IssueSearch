 URL : "https://github.com/rix0rrr/vibe-aws/issues/3" TITLE : future of the lib BODY : ok we would like to know how to proceed from here. we want to make use of this lib. as we did with the last pullrequest we will also help with maintaining it. currently it is not clear how to get a clean version into dub though. your library is not in the dub registry. we made your version working in regards to dynamodb now. there is a fork that added kinesis: https://github.com/yannick/vibe-aws also not on dub and then there is a fork of that fork: https://github.com/tamediadigital/vibe-s3 that is on dub the last fork ditched dynamodb unfortunately : perfect world i guess would be to split the whole signing and stuff into a separate package and have kinesis, dynamodb and s3 in seperate packages depending on it - this requires a lot of effort on all ends though
