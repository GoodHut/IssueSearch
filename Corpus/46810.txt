 URL : "https://github.com/kud1ing/rucaja/issues/19" TITLE : multi-thread use case BODY : my code is in a multi-thread setting, inside each thread, there is a need to call jvm functions. i find that the jvm instance itself cannot be constructed separately inside each thread, by loading the classpath with proper options. in this case, it will panic with a message: ' jni_createjavavm signaled an error: jvm exists already' ...rucaja-0.4.0/src/jvm.rs:186:12 this alternative seems to be putting jvm construction code before spawning threads and then passing as parameters. the problem is that i'm not quite sure whether this will cause data race internally at the jvm side. since i know little about jni and would like to be merely a user of rucaja, could you please advise?
