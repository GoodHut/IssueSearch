 URL : "https://github.com/adamfisher/Xamarin.Forms.VideoPlayer/issues/76" TITLE : question, ios vs andriod BODY : i am interested in this plugin and one of the features that i am looking to do that i have already set on ios is a video preview. with ios i can just call the video component and set a source without autoplay and it will give me a visual of the first frame which can be used as a thumbnail, the same exact code just leads to a black box on andriod. how can i produce the same effect on andriod so a loaded video does not just show a black box but at least the first frame of the video to be played?
