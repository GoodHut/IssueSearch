 URL : "https://github.com/gwu-libraries/sfm-ui/issues/762" TITLE : messages not queueing BODY : because of the way message consumers are mis-configured, consumers are auto-acking messages and queueing them locally. this results in messages not going to available consumers e.g., twitter rest harvesters , which results in messages not being processed efficiently. for harvesting, this is resulting in skipping harvests because earlier harvests are stuck waiting. none of this is visible from monitoring because the queueing is within the consumer not in rabbit.
