 URL : "https://github.com/IQSS/YourCast/issues/3" TITLE : removal from cran BODY : dear developers, i am interested in using yourcast and was wondering whether you could provide information as to why the package has been removed from cran. a cursory internet search did not yield any clues, such as the publication of a new package with similar functionality or a documentation of issues problems with the package. i would be grateful to know whether i can use the archived version in good conscience. thank you!
