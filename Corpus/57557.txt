 URL : "https://github.com/LogicTechCorp/NetherEx/issues/19" TITLE : question: taming mobs. BODY : will there ever be mobs that can be tamed? i am not just talking about like with wolves with the whole feed-bone-get-dog deal. would it be possible to make special mobs that can be tamed through more complex means? this mod has taken very cool approach to augmenting the nether, and i am very impressed by it so far. if you want any of my ideas on different kinds of tamable mobs that could fit within the theme of the mod, i would be more than happy to share them. regardless of your answer, i look forward to what this mod can do in the future. keep up the great work. :
