 URL : "https://github.com/sp614x/optifine/issues/906" TITLE : optifine not installing BODY : i apologize if this is a more common error than i realize, but i've been looking for a few days now and have decided to come seeking help. usually i never have any issues with downloading optifine on minecraft on my desktop that runs on windows 7. a simple installation of the .jar, opening it with java, and i was pretty much set. recently, i got a new laptop which runs on windows 10. i've appropriately installed the latest java update, downloaded the minecraft client/launcher along with version 1.12.2, and was ready to install optifine. unfortunately, whenever i try to install optifine via opening the optifine_1.12.2_hd_u_c5.jar, all i get is a command prompt that remains open for less than half a second which says error: could not find or load main class c:\user\tsutome\downloads\new folder\optifine_1.12.2_hd_u_c5.jar any help and/or guidance is very much appreciated. again, sorry if this is just a silly issue with an easier fix than i anticipated!
