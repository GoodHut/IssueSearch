 URL : "https://github.com/lukechurch/coda/issues/87" TITLE : improve error messages BODY : some of the messages displayed to the user in the alert banner are very unhelpful, especially something is wrong with the data format. change a few things up, refresh and try again. this is particularly bad considering that we can already give more detailed errors in some cases. we should: - display better error messages in the cases we already have data for. - consider how to provide more details in the cases which are currently difficult to explain.
