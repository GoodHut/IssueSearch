 URL : "https://github.com/floatinghotpot/cordova-plugin-facebookads/issues/74" TITLE : facebook mediaview request BODY : over the past few days we have been trying to debug why some of our native ads are loading with what we thought were blank ads. see image below ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30812272/30175374-f1873016-93c3-11e7-8cbb-4bcb287c64c7.png we believe we have tracked it down to this plugin not supporting facebook mediaview which allows for the delivery for carousel and video native ad types. https://www.facebook.com/help/audiencenetwork/1320551334623428 would it be possible to add this to this plugin? i feel like it would be an awesome addition. solution we are trying now to see if it resolves at least users not seeing blanked out ads. is turning off carousel and video ad types from the advanced native ads options in facebook audience network ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30812272/30175506-5f36ac86-93c4-11e7-8efa-a4993a8e8ca4.png let us know if this is something we overlooked and is actually supported by this plugin.
