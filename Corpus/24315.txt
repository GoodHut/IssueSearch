 URL : "https://github.com/geommer/yabar/issues/124" TITLE : soft fork of yabar BODY : dear author of yabar @geommer , dear contributors of yabar @lindenk @nbonaparte @huffstler @abarbu @kjdev @gigawhitlocks @felixonmars @tryone144 @fabiuz99 @sviande , dear users of yabar, due to the inactivity of george and the fact that he is the only one with write access to this repository, i have decided to create a soft fork of yabar at yabar-dev/yabar https://github.com/yabar-dev/yabar . the name yabar https://github.com/yabar was already taken, therefore i went with the organization name yabar-dev https://github.com/yabar-dev this is not meant to discredit the work of george in anyway, rather i and probably quite a few other people want to see this project evolving and developing. there may be very good reasons for george to be not active in the project and if he decides to come back one day i'll be happy to give him ownership of the organization. until then, i'll be happy to merge any pull requests sent to the new project. to the authors of currently open pull requests: please also submit these for yabar-dev/yabar https://github.com/yabar-dev/yabar/pulls : 65 70 92 93 95 113 114 115
