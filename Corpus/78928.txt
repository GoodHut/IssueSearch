 URL : "https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/issues/1794" TITLE : replace e-mail validator BODY : our current e-mail validator is not good. it is a simplistic regular expression that incorrectly flags some e-mails as being valid though they are not. the validates_email_format_of https://github.com/validates-email-format-of/validates_email_format_of gem can be of assistance here. it has a superior implementation of e-mail validation, and superior test cases. we should consider using this solution rather than our current validator.
