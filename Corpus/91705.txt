 URL : "https://github.com/nanobox-io/golang-lvs/issues/6" TITLE : unit testing difficulties BODY : without being able to change the backend/backendstdin/backendrun or having defined interfaces for ipvs, service, etc. it is difficult to mock out this library. would you be open to either exposing the backend variables or providing a way to set them or creating interfaces for the existing structs? i am happy to create a pr to help.
