BODY : @vorugantia - should we commit package-lock.json ? i keep getting this warning: $ npm install npm notice created a lockfile as package-lock.json. you should commit this file. and this file keeps getting generated and show up with git status: $ git status on branch master your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'. untracked files: use git add <file>... to include in what will be committed package-lock.json nothing added to commit but untracked files present use git add to track so we should either commit it, or add it to .gitignore . @vorugantia - i think we should just commit it, no? if you have time, could you read around a bit how it's used i.e. how one updates it as new versions of the dependencies pinned there appear , and add a link or two to a good reference to the gamma-sky.net dev docs?
