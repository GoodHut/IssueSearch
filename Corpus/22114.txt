 URL : "https://github.com/ant-design/create-react-app-antd/issues/5" TITLE : importing antd css BODY : first, thank you so much for starting to support the unix ethos by making antd integrate with create-react-app for those who might be intimidated by the full dva experience. i'm very much looking forward to using this incredible library! very sorry if this is a naive question, but i'm following your tutorial https://ant.design/docs/react/use-with-create-react-app import-antd and i'm not able to see the 'blue primary button' when i use the import statement included in the doc: @import '~antd/dist/antd.css';
