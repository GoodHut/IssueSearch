 URL : "https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/12701" TITLE : cannot import acsch BODY : all hyperbolic and inverse hyperbolic functions, except acsch, can be accessed from sympy. trying from sympy import acsch , acsch is the only inverse hyperbolic function to fail. trying from sympy.functions.elementary.hyperbolic import acsch acsch is again the only inverse hyperbolic function to fail. trying 'run code block in sympy live' here http://docs.sympy.org/dev/modules/functions/elementary.html acsch produces the same errors. compared to the other function definitions here http://docs.sympy.org/dev/_modules/sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.html acsch it seems to be lacking an expansion_term or taylor_term method decorated with staticmethod and cacheit.
