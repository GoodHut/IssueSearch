 URL : "https://github.com/orientechnologies/orientdb/issues/7758" TITLE : get vertex by rid is slow BODY : orientdb version: 2.2.27 java version: 1.8 os: linux expected behavior get vertex by rid should be a o 1 operation, so i can get one vertex in n ms. actual behavior try to get many vertexes by their rid one by one, some of them cause 1~5ms, some of them cause 10 or even 100 ms steps to reproduce 1. get record form hbase and create vertex in orientdb 2. cache this mapping hbase' rowkey -> orientdb' rid in redis 3. repeat 1 and 2 to create 2 hundred million vertexes 4. scan hbase again to get the rowkey one by one 5. get the rid from redis base on the rowkey: this operation is fast, causes only 1 ms. 6. get vertex by rid, this is the issue describe above
