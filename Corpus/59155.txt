 URL : "https://github.com/bamarni/pi64/issues/44" TITLE : thanks for the project BODY : i needed a way to run aarch64 docker images on my raspberry pi and was lost till i found this project. it works like a charm. i simply install docker from the prebuilt static binaries, install iptables , add a docker user and write a systemd unit for dockerd and i'm good to go! thanks for the great work.
