 URL : "https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-core/issues/514" TITLE : question of design BODY : greetings, i have come across the bitshares exchange and github site and like the peer-to-peer design for the exchange. i am trying to get a feel for how things are laid out. from what i can see, the bitshares-core runs on the peer nodes and establishes links with other bitshares nodes as the backend exchange which it seems that the bitshares-ui provides a frontend cloud interface that uses api calls to the backend nodes. also, i see that there are executables for different platforms as well as the web ui interface and also assume that these executable manage the local wallet and make api calls to the bitshares-core backend nodes. is this correct? if it is, the do i assume that the bitshares-core can be run on a few lan nodes while the bitshares-ui can be set up on a web server and the bitshares executables can be run locally as well? any clarification on the design would be greatly appreciated. thanks, lonnie
