 URL : "https://github.com/shaun-edwards/moveit_simple/issues/2" TITLE : moving in with moveit? BODY : hey @shaun-edwards, you just pointed at this package from ros-answers, so i had a look. it is a great idea to create a small brother'' of the move_group node, that can be instantiated/controlled in a c++ context without ros interaction! the movegroup action outgrew the simple industrial use-case quite some time ago and this would remove complexity for some applications quite a lot. what do you think about integrating this into the moveit repository in kinetic? that would probably give it a bit more users and because we bump sonames in every release of kinetic, you don't have to consider abi breakage. : i do understand that quite a bit of intended functionality is missing here at the moment.
