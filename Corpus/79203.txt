 URL : "https://github.com/Windower/Issues/issues/940" TITLE : sandbox - chatlog issues BODY : ever since the last update i've been having issues with chat logs - losing chat logs, chat logs getting mixed together and crashing while looking at chatlogs. prior to the last update, i'd very rarely have any chat log issues since sandbox was introduced. when i asked on ah i was asked to unload/load to check version but //unload sandbox says plugin not loaded and //load sandbox says module not found. it's on in my windower profile and i have a sandbox.dll in my plugins folder - modified 7/3/2017 4:56 pm, 125kb. i have tried deleting the plugin from the folder and redownloading with no success. looking in the temp folder, it looks like all new files are being put in the base temp directory, whereas previous files were being put into temp\character-specific folders.
