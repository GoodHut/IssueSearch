 URL : "https://github.com/linbox-team/linbox/issues/70" TITLE : hadamard bound computation BODY : we need upper bounds on the absolute value of the determinant over fields such as integers, rational, or polynomials . we propose to make a new solution for a determinant bound. specifically, it should return a bound on the bit-length of the determinant. for finite fields should it just return 1? for polynomial fields it should be instead the degree plus one?
