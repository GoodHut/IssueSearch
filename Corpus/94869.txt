 URL : "https://github.com/zooniverse/Panoptes/issues/2256" TITLE : collection default subject BODY : gravity spy would like for their volunteers to be able to select what the prototypical subject is for a collection. right now, the front end just fetches the first subject in the links array and displays that. instead, the volunteer should be able to select which one to load for the collection preview. i thought that a configuration object similar to workflows might work for this purpose where we can write arbitrary key value pairs. which ever subject is selected, its id and media source would be written to the configuration and that would be what is loaded as the prototypical subject. i'm also open to suggestion about any better way to do this.
