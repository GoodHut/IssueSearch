 URL : "https://github.com/react-component/tree/issues/132" TITLE : drag & drop not accurate BODY : hey, the drag&drop functionality is very frustrating to use for users, it doesn't work very accurately, especially when you try to move a node to the beginning/end of a parent. just check the https://ant.design/components/tree/ demo and try to play around with drag/drop. i understand it is not very trivial to implement, but if its there, i'd expect it to work better.
