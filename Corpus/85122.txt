 URL : "https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/1278" TITLE : er request: record editor BODY : i'm opening this issue because: - db4s is crashing - db4s has a bug - x db4s needs a feature - db4s has another problem i'm using db4s version 3.10.1 the cell editor is nice, but a record editor would be very helpful and perhaps essential for records with numerous fields. other sql editors have such a feature e.g. phpliteadmin . thank you!
