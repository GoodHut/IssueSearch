 URL : "https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons/Master_gff3_parser/issues/13" TITLE : add ids not just convert BODY : i expect a very useful feature to be adding identifiers to the gff3 that match the identifiers found in the column with a new key. instead of changing values in place, one would append another identifier in place that matches the discovered identifier. great stuff!
