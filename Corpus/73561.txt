 URL : "https://github.com/ReScience/ReScience/issues/46" TITLE : criteria for publication BODY : under criteria for publication, it is written you cannot submit the replication of your own research, nor the research of your close collaborators. we believe such restrictions will favor the cross-fertilization of research and the spread of knowledge. the first part is clear. we have replicated a 20 year old study in a modern language without seeing the original implementation or knowing the language and the precise algorithms. the first author of the paper wrote all the code and prepared the figures, but we do not know him. the second and third authors will provide ideas on future directions of a related project but we will write the code and tools. can we submit our contribution?
