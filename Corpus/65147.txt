 URL : "https://github.com/masak/007/issues/238" TITLE : implement splice, kinda BODY : splice , a very versatile array function/method in major languages such as perl and javascript, is awkwardly missing from 007. we already have, map , filter , push , pop , shift , and unshift . but no splice . this is likely going to be a keenly felt omission once we move into making the q mutation api a reality. except... ew. look at it https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/javascript/reference/global_objects/array/splice . just look at it http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/splice.html . to me, splice looks like two methods that someone decided to cross-breed into one method. the end result is very multifunctional, but it's not easy to grok except with the kind of experience that consists of looking at something for long enough that it starts to seem normal. instead, i propose: array.removeelements start, count array.insertelements index, e1, e2... i'm on the fence about whether removeelements should return the removed array. i don't recall ever needing that in anger while programming &mdash; and it feels like trying to do one thing beyond the method's charter. on the other hand, maybe some things i can't think of right now could be written more nicely if it did return those elements.
