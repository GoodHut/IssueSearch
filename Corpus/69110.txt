 URL : "https://github.com/paed01/bpmn-engine/issues/24" TITLE : strange events sequence BODY : hello, i wrote small script that executes bpmn process by steps, and logs «start» and «leave» events. but i have two issues: 1 leaving from block appears _after_ than next block's start event. is it normal? 2 to be clear, my project must executes in parallel many bpmn process and i start it by queue, that in each step execute 1-3 blocks from bpmn scheme, save state to storage and stop engine. i found that for me it better case to parallel execution of many long time up to mounths processes. in this case i also have trouble that sometimes i execute block two times, because it executes _after_ engine stoped. how can i prevent this? all sources in attach. running node index.js , cleaning cache after execution rm data/ bpmn_engine.zip https://github.com/paed01/bpmn-engine/files/909499/bpmn_engine.zip start step start process_1 start start start fetch <--- 2 here engine stoping end of step <--- 2 here engine stoped fetch send <--- 2 but it executes block! start step start fetch <--- 1 fetch send <--- 2 and executes second time in next step fetch receive fetch receive start exclusivegateway_18cywiu <--- 1 leave fetch <--- 1 start parser end of step start step start parser start logweather current weather in kazan: 4 leave parser start exclusivegateway_0c57ix8 end of step start step start exclusivegateway_0c57ix8 leave exclusivegateway_0c57ix8 start parallel1 start paralleltask1 end of step start step start paralleltask1 start parallel1 start paralleltask2 end of step start step start paralleltask2 start parallel2 leave paralleltask2
