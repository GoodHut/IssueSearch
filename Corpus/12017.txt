 URL : "https://github.com/bodymovin/bodymovin/issues/675" TITLE : merge paths help BODY : i am working on a huge interactive project with several attached scenes and layers all converted to shape layers from ai. after going through and deleting all of the merge paths from the contents, not all will go nicely. when i delete it from these tree layers it completely changes the look and i can't figure out why or how. like i said, all the other layers allowed me to delete the merge paths with no issues. any thoughts on how i can get around this? i saw in another issue about recreating the shapes with mask but im not sure if that's possible with the design of these tree. i am attaching screenshots of how they look with and without the merge paths. ! screen shot 2017-10-14 at 2 27 47 pm https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32747720/31578691-2d0cbae4-b0ec-11e7-8024-26f0ef86a7cf.png ! screen shot 2017-10-14 at 2 28 05 pm https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32747720/31578692-2d1fd1f6-b0ec-11e7-9148-68bf12e097c2.png
