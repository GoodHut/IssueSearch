 URL : "https://github.com/plan44/localSites/issues/2" TITLE : support for el capitan BODY : safari 11 is for os x 10.11.6 and above, so a version with support for el capitan would be great. i'll try building this myself as well, but maybe there are users out there without xcode who'd want it for el capitan.
