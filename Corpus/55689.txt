 URL : "https://github.com/davqvist/CustomAchievements/issues/8" TITLE : lava destroys trophies BODY : the trophies are deleted by lava. in my playthrough, lava flowed onto one and instead of burning up, it was just deleted by the lava as soon as the lava flowed onto it. i don't know how to spawn another trophy in to replace it either. would love to right click a trophy as an admin and set the item/name as well
