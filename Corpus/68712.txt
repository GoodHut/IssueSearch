 URL : "https://github.com/PRX/publish.prx.org/issues/378" TITLE : set the episode summary BODY : currently we use the html description in both the <description> tag and the <itunes:summary> tag, with the summary stripped of all but anchor tags. some folks still like to edit this themselves, so we could offer that as an option on the podcast episode info tab. could that be a stripped down prosemirror editor with only links available as formatting?
