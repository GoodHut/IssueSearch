 URL : "https://github.com/weechat/weechat/issues/1049" TITLE : irc: rpl_redir 010 support BODY : feature requested by exterminador in weechat. unrealircd allows the irc server to redirect clients to another server/port https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/configuration redirect-server_.26_redirect-port . the documentation on the details of how this is done is vague but digging into unrealircd sources reveals the following: irc protocol command format https://github.com/unrealircd/unrealircd/blob/f71b173f07cc892916b3a71a6caf99bf0c13c0c5/src/s_err.c l38 usage of that format https://github.com/unrealircd/unrealircd/blob/7b092f7aeb441d3abdc38aa7449cfa803f30410a/src/s_conf.c l2852 turns out irc numeric 010 https://www.alien.net.au/irc/irc2numerics.html is used for this but weechat does not support it. an option should probably be introduced to change whether weechat reacts to rpl_redir and creates a new connection or not. rpl_redir is used very little but the implementation of this serves as a starting point for ircv3.3 sts http://ircv3.net/specs/core/sts-3.3.html implementation as well.
