 URL : "https://github.com/IKCAP/wings/issues/39" TITLE : can't see 'admin' menu BODY : i'm currently working on dockerizing wings at https://github.com/spencernorris/wings-docker . i'm able to access the portal as the admin user but wings doesn't display the 'admin' menu that's supposed to be located across the top, so i can't check my resources for distributed execution. anyone have a similar problem when running wings bare-metal?
