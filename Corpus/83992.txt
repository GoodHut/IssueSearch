 URL : "https://github.com/t-woerner/firewalld/issues/197" TITLE : constraining output rules BODY : hi, i was positively surprised about firewalld integration with networkmanger in ubuntu 16.04. however it seems zone rules only affect inbound packets not the outgoing ones. a laptop that has been joined to ad domain is rather chatty on the network ports 53, 88, 389, etc . all those connections should go only to vpn tunnel so for the wireless connection where i select default zone public i presume the outgoing connections should be filtered. is this planned for future releases or is there an easy way to add the filtering in current releases?
