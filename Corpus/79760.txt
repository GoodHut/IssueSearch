BODY : we changed stop in tween.js to this, to stop all tweens in a chain: javascript stop: function { if !this._chained { this.playing = false; this.stopped = true; } else { // chained. iterate, tracking what we've seen to avoid infinite loops . // could use a chase-pointer, but the list is likely to // be short, and we'll avoid extra stops this way, // but likely take extra gc load due to the array. var seen = ; for var cur = this; cur && seen.indexof cur === -1; cur = cur._chained { cur.playing = false; cur.stopped = true; seen.push cur ; } } }, posting this more or less as a request for comment . we ran into a few cases where devs assumed stopping the head of a chain would stop the rest, and bugs resulted. i could see arguing for a separate stopchain or similar, and the singly-linked nature of the chain makes the prospect of stopping something mid-chain a little wonky, so -- not sure what i think about this generally. but we're likely to ship with it for at least one game, so it seemed worth bumping upstream for comment.
