 URL : "https://github.com/oalders/html-restrict/issues/26" TITLE : another br tag issue BODY : im on version html::restrict v2.2.4. i have the problem that <br/> tags are not preserved with the basic br => ' rule, only if there is a space between 'br' and '/' . perl !/usr/bin/env perl use warnings; use strict; use utf8; my $snippet = 'two element open & close break<br></br> one element open & close break <br /> one element open & close break no space<br/> '; use html::restrict; my $stuff = html::restrict->new trim => 0, rules => { br => , 'br/' => , }, ; print $stuff->process $snippet ; only with the rule 'br/' is the last line break preserved. without the rule i get this output: two element open & close break<br></br> one element open & close break <br /> one element open & close break no space is that the intended solution?
