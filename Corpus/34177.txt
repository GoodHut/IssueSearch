 URL : "https://github.com/nco/pynco/issues/30" TITLE : c.rename not defined BODY : hi, i'm trying to rename all vars and dims in a set of netcdf files and wanted to use python to achieve this. i found pynco and used your sample code for renaming. os.chdir '/g/data/rr9/im_phd/data/test_download/latlon_fix/mu-clim/' nco = pynco.nco rdict = { 'latitude': 'lat', 'longitude': 'lon' } for fname in glob ' .nc' : nco.ncrename input=fname, options= c.rename variable , rdict however it comes up a 'nameerror: name 'c' is not defined'. i'm not a python guru so thought my code might be off, but can you confirm? the docs make no mention of defining a 'c' object. cheers ian
