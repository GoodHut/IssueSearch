 URL : "https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/issues/446" TITLE : scalar handing changes BODY : currently our scalar handling is not correct in several aspects: - parseliteral should return null if it can't be parsed and not throw an exception. argumentsofcorrecttype will check that the type is correct. - it is not allowed to throw away some infos when coercing. for example 124.3 is not a valid value for int. instead an error must be thrown. see https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/issues/171 and https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/issues/827 - nonnull handling error: https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/issues/438
