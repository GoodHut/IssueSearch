 URL : "https://github.com/json-schema-org/json-schema-spec/issues/517" TITLE : have a proper change log BODY : i found something resembling a changelog on the website faq via 330. but it wasn't so easy to find, looks somewhat informal, and the faq doesn't seem like the proper place for the change log. it should be more prominent. also looks like you've used a different way of documenting changes in v7. - add changelog https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/changelog file in specification repo. - add dedicated change log or migration page on the web site linked from the home page. - be clear about strategy for documenting changes and write it down in contributing.md.
