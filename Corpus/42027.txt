 URL : "https://github.com/wireservice/csvkit/issues/883" TITLE : add transpose feature BODY : as i can see in the docs, there doesn't seem to be a feature to rearrange a csv file, so that it's columns will be transposed as rows and vice versa. it would be really nifty, if you could add this feature as i don't see any simple work around for this.
