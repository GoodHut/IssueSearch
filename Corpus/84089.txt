 URL : "https://github.com/simoncozens/Net-KashFlow/issues/10" TITLE : couple of bugs, and fixes BODY : i'm just doing some code to delete some transactions and payments, and found that in kashflow.pm, there are some issues: sub delete_invoice_payment { my $self, $data = @_; my $p = $self->get_payment $data ; eval { $self->_c deleteinvoicepayment , $data }; die $@. if $@; return 1; } this needs removing: my $p = $self->get_payment $data ; also, a little bit higher you have: $kf->get_receipt_payment { invoicenumber => $id } ; this should be: get_invoice_payment ...and not: get_receipt_payment anyway, just wanted to pass those on so they could get fixed for the release : cheers andy
