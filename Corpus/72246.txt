BODY : this is probably working as intended but i figured i would ask. i am using a reactive form, my control value is an array of objects. when i use binglabel, everything is fine. when i bindvalue to a property within the objects, it throws an error. error error: binding object with bindvalue is not allowed. cities: = {id: '1', name: 'vilnius'}, {id: '2', name: 'kaunas'}, {id: '3', name: 'pavilnys'} ; ngoninit { this.heroform = this.fb.group { city: this.cities } ; } <ng-select items = cities placeholder= select city bindvalue= id bindlabel= name formcontrolname= city > </ng-select> should i be able to bind to the property of an object such as bindvalue= cities.id or bindvalue= city.id ? i may be over thinking this, seems to work without the bindvalue there at all but was curious why i was getting the error. https://plnkr.co/edit/ernhdjbeiqhttcmmk4zv?p=preview
