 URL : "https://github.com/att/ast/issues/35" TITLE : missing alarm man page BODY : unable to locate any documentation on the alarm builtin. according to this thread https://www.mail-archive.com/ksh93-integration-discuss@mail.opensolaris.org/msg02974.html , circa 2006, david korn was not _ready to publicise_ -- he had concerns about possible conflicts with _new_ functionality. what's the status today? in summary: a is the alarm builtin usable? b can we trace sufficient usage information to build a manage? cheers, don
