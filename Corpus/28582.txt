 URL : "https://github.com/seperman/deepdiff/issues/78" TITLE : handling of renames BODY : for my migration system, one of the more often applied use cases is a rename of a dictionary key which in jsonschema often is the name of an object's field , so what i get from that is: { dictionary_item_removed : { root 'properties' 'obatzter' : { description : custom user notes , type : string , format : html , title : user notes }}, dictionary_item_added : { root 'properties' 'apfelsalat' : { description : custom user notes , type : string , format : html , title : user notes }} } where the fieldname obatzter was renamed to apfelsalat . the above syntax is not so nice for migration, so i'd love to rather get a diff that says: { dictionary_item_renamed : { root 'properties' 'obatzter' : root 'properties' 'apfelsalat' } } might that please be possible?
