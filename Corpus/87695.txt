 URL : "https://github.com/cnjinhao/nana/issues/269" TITLE : make build process easier BODY : i am sure my mingw-w64 support thread. and it is true that many other forks support std::thread. but it is still using boost::thread. and i found there are some hard-written lines in the c++defines.hpp that causes the problem. will you add nana_force_std_thread options to cmake? cpp //assume the std::thread is not implement on mingw //but some toolchains may implement std::thread. ifdef nana_mingw ifndef std_thread_not_supported define std_thread_not_supported endif endif i have to manually change header files to build successfully. this definitely scares away beginners. i would like to recommend nana to my friends.. currently filesystem is not a core feature of stdc++, to build the apps using the nana that build with std filesystem, we need to add -lstdc++fs and other stuff in my computer, -lktmw32 for gcc. i would suggest setting nana_cmake_filesystem_force to default true.
