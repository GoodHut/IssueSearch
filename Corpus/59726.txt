 URL : "https://github.com/openaddresses/pyesridump/issues/41" TITLE : uri character encoding BODY : came across this uri: https://services6.arcgis.com/7cenqo09akkccb85/arcgis/rest/services/routes%20to%20smith%20mountain%20lake%20 points /featureserver that has and characters, which causes pyesridump to error out: syntax error near unexpected token ' ' . easily fixed swapping out for %28 and for %29 , but ideally the tool can do that for us. at some point i'm going to look into source code and see if its an easy enough fix for me to apply.
