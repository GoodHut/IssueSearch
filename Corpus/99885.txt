 URL : "https://github.com/AndrewKeig/express-validation/issues/64" TITLE : no way to use dependencies BODY : not sure if this is an issue or maybe just a new feature but in joi you can do something like this: const schema = joi.object .keys { a: joi.any , b: joi.any } .xor 'a', 'b' ; where then it is saying you can have either a or b but not both and that ends up in a attribute called dependencies in the joi object. there seems to be no way to get that xor section into the joi schema within express-validation
