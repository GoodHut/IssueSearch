 URL : "https://github.com/machinekit/mk-builder/issues/6" TITLE : docker build ... fails BODY : when executing the docker build -t ... command, the build fails with a security error when trying to run the first proot command after multistrapping. this is because the default docker container seccomp profile disallows ptrace. is there a known workaround to get this building in ci like the main repository here, or is travis just configured with an older version of docker / kernel that doesn't have the security feature turned on? currently, i can build the container manually by docker run ...docker commit , but it would be nice if the build instructions worked out of the box.
