 URL : "https://github.com/browscap/browscap-site/issues/35" TITLE : possibility of a mirror? BODY : we've discussed this briefly before https://github.com/browscap/browscap/issues/511 issuecomment-63340798 but maybe we could figure out a good way to make this work? could the download requests still go to browscap.org for stat collection and abuse mitigation, but the actual file request would be distributed between browscap.org and a mirror we'd provide? abusers could still potentially just cache the final redirect, whether it's browscap.org or our mirror, but maybe it would reduce your bandwidth usage to have the legit users split between two file locations. i'm not sure what the specifics would be yet, just wanted to bring it up for further discussion since bandwidth seems to be a problem lately.
