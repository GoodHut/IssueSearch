 URL : "https://github.com/redhat-gpe/bxms_advanced_infrastructure/issues/33" TITLE : bxms ansible module BODY : justin holmes recommends students of this course use ansible to provision bpm suite environments. a year ago, justin created an ilt on this topic https://github.com/sherl0cks/ansible-openstack-etc/tree/master/ansible . related: the student vm for this course is built using bernard's ansible play book https://github.com/redhat-gpe/open_virtual/tree/master/automation/bxms-advanced-infrastructure/bxms-advanced-infrastructure-virtual-machine . suggest the following: 1 move bernard's bxms ansible playbook to the public lab assets for this course. 2 insert a new module, 01_bxms_ansible , into the course. in this module, we provide the student with the base centos image and all of the bxms binaries. the student then executes bernard's instructions https://github.com/redhat-gpe/open_virtual/blob/master/automation/bxms-advanced-infrastructure/bxms-advanced-infrastructure-virtual-machine/readme.adoc . the result is the same vm for the course that the instructor would have provided to the student anyway. 3 bump up the module numbers of the other 4 existing modules of this course.
