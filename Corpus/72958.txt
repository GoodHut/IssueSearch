 URL : "https://github.com/numbbo/coco/issues/1578" TITLE : cleaning up cocopp.<tab> BODY : the title says kind of everything, see also the comment of @nikohansen in 1353. currently, cocopp.<tab> gives cocopp.bestalg cocopp.config cocopp.info cocopp.captions cocopp.dataformatsettings cocopp.load cocopp.cococommands cocopp.findfiles cocopp.main cocopp.comp2 cocopp.genericsettings cocopp.pickle cocopp.compall cocopp.htmldesc cocopp.ppconverrorbars for me. from my point of view, bestalg , config , genericsettings , load , and main have to stay for sure while main should be clearly renamed in the long run . pickle and htmldesc must go out. for the others, we shall discuss but i am fine if they go out as well . that gives, for the moment, the following list of things that shall stay: - x cocopp.bestalg - x cocopp.config - cocopp.info - cocopp.captions - cocopp.dataformatsettings - x cocopp.load - cocopp.cococommands - cocopp.findfiles - x cocopp.main to be renamed - cocopp.comp2 - x cocopp.genericsettings - cocopp.pickle - cocopp.compall - cocopp.htmldesc - cocopp.ppconverrorbars feel free to adjust list list.
