 URL : "https://github.com/robintibor/python-mindwave-mobile/issues/13" TITLE : invalid datarowcode value BODY : hello, i'm just getting off the ground w/ my new mindwave mobile+ and this package has been great for connecting with my ubuntu 16.04 system. the snag i'm hitting is that the hardware sync works fine, but when it gets to the _createdatapoint function in the packet payload parser, it fails with an 'assert false' due to an invalid datarowcode value. sniffing the bluetooth connection with wireshark shows this packet arrives before other, proper-format packets: aa aa 02 ba 04 41 aa aa 02 bc 04 3f the 0xaa start_packets are right, the 02 byte len is right, the checksum is right, but the codes 0xba and 0xbc aren't accounted for and i can't find any reference to them in the on-line docs. so - am i missing something? did they alter the protocol details? tia for any ideas and thanks again for releasing the code - it's made understanding the mindwave much easier. cheers! bill
