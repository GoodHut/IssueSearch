 URL : "https://github.com/FACN3/mrrobot_project2/issues/22" TITLE : adding multiple todos BODY : i can add duplicate todos. this may not be a problem but do you want your user to have multiple todos with the same things eg make coffee make coffee. i admit this is up for debate but is worth considering and could be an interesting thing to implement?
