 URL : "https://github.com/solsort/bogapp/issues/31" TITLE : how do we approach ui? BODY : at the moment we use react-md, but i am wondering if this is the right choice. in my opinion, the optimal ui-library would have the following: - easily testable components with jest/jsdom - following material design guidelines - just simple presentational components - cross-platform - usable both within html5, and also react-native/react-xp - using material-components, i.e. not reinventing the wheel it turns out that react-md is not friendly towards jest-testing - so i am tempted to play around with react-toolbox to see if that is better.. or do you have any thoughts / opinions about ui-framework. @aklt you had some thoughts about including styling etc?
