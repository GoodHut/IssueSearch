 URL : "https://github.com/ArekSredzki/electron-release-server/issues/172" TITLE : set default channel BODY : when clicking the download button in the top or the get it now! button on the startpage, the app will be routed to /releases which in turn routes to /releases/alpha given the default channels . if i understand this correctly the channels are listed alphabetically and the first one will be the default channel e.g. alpha in this case. however, nobody wants to highlight the alpha-download-release, the stable is what we as publisher want to announce and the end user to download. is there a way to set the default channel and redirect the /releases page to the set default channel? thanks
