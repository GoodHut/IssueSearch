 URL : "https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/issues/175" TITLE : timing issue in BODY : the medicationorder state type indicates a point in the module where a medication should be prescribed. the medicationorder state must come after an encounter state in the module, but must have the same start time as that encounter ; otherwise it will not be recorded in the patient's record. see the encounter section above for more details. however, in allergies/severe_allergic_reaction.json there is a 2-6 hr observation_period separating the mild_steroid medication order from its ed_visit_for_allergic_reaction. this causes an exception every time it occurs, since the order state does not have the same start time as the encounter. this can be resolved by moving the order to precede the delay.
