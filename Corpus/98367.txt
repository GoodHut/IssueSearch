 URL : "https://github.com/swindon-rs/tk-http/issues/27" TITLE : integrating with tokio-tls BODY : hi, i've seen in the example for tls_client tokio-rustls is used, it would be great to have an example of using tokio-tls, which will use the native tls libs. i'm still new to the tokio/futures libs, so not sure will be able to pull it off without reading the source for tokio/futures/tk-http/tokio-tls. so, if you could please provide an example for it working or confirm that it should work? thanks
