 URL : "https://github.com/LoneGazebo/Community-Patch-DLL/issues/3026" TITLE : weird peace refusal BODY : i'm noticing this on a few autoplays that i take over by the middle of the game that if there is a city that the ai really favors in the war, they'll extend the war in an attempt to recapture that lost city, however i could just capture any other city that isn't that favored city and i could immediately make peace.
