 URL : "https://github.com/jjaffeux/emoji-db/issues/1" TITLE : flag of spain is missing BODY : the flag of :es: spain is missing. i haven't checked, but other emoji may be missing too. looking at the rake file this should be caused by a missing entry in db.json https://github.com/jjaffeux/emoji-db/blob/master/db.json . where is this file coming from? can we sync it with the official unicode list?
