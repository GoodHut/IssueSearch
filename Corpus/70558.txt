 URL : "https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/23237" TITLE : why is v4 beta blocked? BODY : v4.0.0-beta milestone is stuck at 99% for months. there seems no apparent reason why the team is not releasing at least the beta. we are stuck with alpha6 for 8+ months now. i and thousands of other people would like to integrate any changes/bugfixes that accumulated during those months. we started using v4 for business apps that were planned to be production-ready now. it's been years of v4 development and nobody would have predicted that we'd be stuck with alpha 6 at the end of 2017! please be kind to answer: - what is the reason of not releasing at least v4.0.0-beta or call it alpha 7 if its still messy . - is this project abandoned / essentially unsuited for future-oriented projects... i know you devs have no obligation to anyone whatsoever... i have no right to demand anything. but i think i have a right to be answered. i did bet on your project and i'm having difficulties in soon-to-be-production projects. please don't close this thread. let us have at least one place where we could talk about this. you're not updating your milestones, you're not updating the blog, you're closing any question that asks for more info.... this is a symptoms of abandoned projects. bootstrap is what it is because of love from its users. now you are shutting the door in their face. please don't do that.
