 URL : "https://github.com/UkuuPeople/ukuupeople-the-simple-crm/issues/117" TITLE : search org name bug BODY : this came in via helpscout query, and i checked it and verified that it doesn't work to search for part of an organization name unless that part of the name is also in the email address . i've noticed that searching for organisations doesn't work if the search query is not in the email address of the organisation. upon closer inspection of class-ukuupeople.php i can see that you have added a filter to search for organisations display names line 1244 . this filter does not seem to work in practice, can you confirm whether you are aware of this bug?
