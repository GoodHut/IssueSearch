 URL : "https://github.com/psifidotos/Latte-Dock/issues/524" TITLE : trash not supported BODY : i tried to move the trash folder of my desktop to the dock. worked fine, the icon was shown in the dock. but now i have the following problems: - i cannot move files to the trash in the dock, so they get deleted like in osx - it is not possible to remove the trash icon from the dock. only way i found is to delete the dock and start from a new config without the trash this bug is not too important but may be confusing for new people.
