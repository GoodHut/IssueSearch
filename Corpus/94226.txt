 URL : "https://github.com/slapperwan/gh4a/issues/721" TITLE : bug: back pressed on login BODY : when trying to login, a browser opens up in order to grant github access to github used account, if instead of granting that, i click on the top left x button, the browser closes and i get back to the app. although, the screen keeps showing a loader like it is trying to login, and i don't get the possibility to perform a new login anymore since the button is not visible anymore
