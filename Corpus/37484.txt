 URL : "https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/issues/1096" TITLE : massive recipe crash BODY : issue description: when trying to calculate the requirements of a massive enough recipe, refined storage will use all the remaining ram a server has to offer and crash the server. this happens after pressing cancel. the specific interaction that caused this was calculating a tier 16 blood tank from blood magic 2 which requires 30^16 stone, 30^16 cobble, 10^16 blank slates, and a few other ^16 piecemeal items and recipes. but it's likely to happen for any sufficiently large recipes. i had already cancelled the calculation due to the amount of time it was taking, but it didn't respond to that and went through with filling up the ram anyway. i expected the cancel to go through or for the rs system to catch such a runaway recipe before it crashed the server. version make sure you are on the latest version before reporting : - minecraft: 1.10.2 - forge: 12.18.3.2254 - refined storage: 1.2.22 does this issue occur on a server? y
