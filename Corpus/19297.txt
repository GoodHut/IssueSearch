 URL : "https://github.com/spipu/html2pdf/issues/208" TITLE : 5.0 won't install. BODY : i am not that versed in composer but i entered composer require spipu/html2pdf and, along with other errors i get the following: problem 1 - the requested package spipu/html2pdf no version set parsed as 1.0.0 is satisfiable by spipu/html2pdf no version set parsed as 1.0.0 but these conflict with your requirements or minimum-stability. now, i don't know what the not about commits is all about---and can't find it in the composer doc, without reading it cover to cover---so i didn't do anything there. since the install didn't work i did a computer update and it ran to completion, with lots of installs . now, things kinda' work. most of the examples work. surprisingly, the examples folder is invisible thru desktop server . i had to move everything to another folder to test the examples. anyway, any ideas? oh, yes. i am running under windows 10.
