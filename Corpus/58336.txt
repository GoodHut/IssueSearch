 URL : "https://github.com/tuupola/jquery_lazyload/issues/402" TITLE : setting for rootmargin BODY : hello, it would be nice to allow us to configure the rootmargin intersection observer setting. this way we can accomplish pre-loading of images that are not yet in the viewport. the end result would be the users will never see an empty/loading image while they scroll at normal speed to the bottom of the page.
