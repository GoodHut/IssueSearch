 URL : "https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl/issues/425" TITLE : @ref links to julia docs BODY : i am almost done porting all of knet docs to documenter, so far a great experience, thanks for an awesome utility! knet overloads a lot of julia base functions, which i want to refer to in the docs. is there an easy way to automatically generate links for them to point to julia docs from knet docs?
