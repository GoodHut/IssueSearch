 URL : "https://github.com/SCPR/AssetHost/issues/14" TITLE : fix thumbnail generation BODY : the last ticket went missing for some reason, but the scope changed anyway. there were some problems around paperclip in rails 5 that i wasn't able to resolve. i could get it to the point where it would upload the original asset to s3, but it would not cut out thumbnails even with our thumbnail processor removed i.e. basic settings described in documentation . the way i got it to work was to remove the paperclip callbacks and write a module that will call convert and save the thumbnails to s3, as well as return exif data.
