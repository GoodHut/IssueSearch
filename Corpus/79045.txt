 URL : "https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/15374" TITLE : restore: occasional ooms BODY : i'm still occasionally seeing ooms on lapis during restores though much less often than 14776 . it doesn't reproduce reliably, but seems to be correlated with a node having a lot of leases the scatter we use is best effort, so sometimes it doesn't do a good job . the first thing to try is commenting out the scatter and see if i can get some heap dumps
