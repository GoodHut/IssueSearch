 URL : "https://github.com/balinterdi/rarwe-issues/issues/255" TITLE : appendix link on page 11 BODY : on page 11, there is a link to the appendix in red, but it does not link to anything. it would be nice if it linked to the yarn item in the appendix. also, the appendix is referred to as encore earlier in the book, so maybe that term should be used here instead of, or in addition to, appendix.
