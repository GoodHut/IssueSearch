 URL : "https://github.com/ArnaudRinquin/atom-zentabs/issues/44" TITLE : add support for panel BODY : thanks for your package, i like idea to keep one workspace simple and uncluttered. use case i always work with 2 panes left/right issue i was puzzled as the package didn't seem to work at first . then, after a second try and some experimentations i realized the limit is only enforced on a per-pane basis and not globally . feature request would you consider adding an options to apply the constrains on the total number of tabs open whatever panes they are?
