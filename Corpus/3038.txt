 URL : "https://github.com/eagleas/clamav/issues/9" TITLE : how to build? BODY : i'd like to build a version of this gem that does not include the virus test files https://github.com/eagleas/clamav/tree/master/spec/clamav-testfiles and thus does not trigger a false-positive on a full-disk virus scan . i see that the test files are mentioned in the clamav.gemspec https://github.com/eagleas/clamav/blob/master/clamav.gemspec file, but the comments therein direct me to edit the rakefile https://github.com/eagleas/clamav/blob/master/rakefile l28 instead. i don't see where the test files are mentioned in the rakefile. and even if i did, there are no instructions for rebuilding the gem from source. could someone point me in the right direction?
