 URL : "https://github.com/aelsabbahy/goss/issues/247" TITLE : single line json output BODY : hi, i'm using goss in a systemd timer and journalbeat to ship the logs to elasticsearch. at the moment i'm using the nagios_verbose format and parsing it in logstash but if the json output was a single line json message i could use that directly with no need for parsing. can you make the json output format single line and maybe introduce a json_pretty that is multi line? thanks.
