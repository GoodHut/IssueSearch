 URL : "https://github.com/schul-cloud/schulcloud-client/issues/398" TITLE : disuss german url-paths BODY : we've got a recommendations that we should use german urls in the client. so instead of using: /courses/... it should routed as /faecher/... and so on. on my opinion, english urls are better. it is not common to use german paths, even if we are a german project with mainly german users. what do you think about it?
