 URL : "https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/VisualRust/issues/289" TITLE : generics brace matching BODY : simply adding '<' and '>' to bracelist ala https://github.com/maulingmonkey/visualrust/commit/55d7bef48d12fe44edd33972b039e3d868548452 generates false positives from comparison operators. but perhaps that's ok for v1? or perhaps generics are generally simple enough that generics brace matching isn't all that necessary. a more robust implementation would probably want to use a full blown ast. visualrust doesn't currently have one unless i'm mistaken? my understanding is that rustclassifier{,provider} provides syntax highlighting, but is only doing basic lexing rather than a full blown parse?
