 URL : "https://github.com/githubteacher/githubfordevelopers-april/issues/20" TITLE : question about web ui BODY : hi briana, this web ui that we are using...is it analogous to the gui that i downloaded as part of the git windows 2.12.2 package? i have not yet run that gui, but am wondering if it is the same thing as this web gui. also, is the web gui functionally the same as git cli?
