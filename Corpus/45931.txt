 URL : "https://github.com/milasudril/maike/issues/60" TITLE : issues with lto stuff BODY : lto is a global option no-lto must be preserved on translation units otherwise some inline asm may fail to make lto work, current release and a few releases back do not collect settings for individual tu:s. however, this breaks link-time options collected from tu:s most importat option probably is -l . one solution is some kind of filter in optionscollect targetcxx.cpp . maybe use special treatment for lto options.
