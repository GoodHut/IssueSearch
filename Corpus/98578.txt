 URL : "https://github.com/lwdgit/gitbook-plugin-search-plus/issues/4" TITLE : issue with toggle-chapters BODY : hi, i'm using empty chapters in my book with the ungrey and toggle-chapters plugin. this allows to display only the top level articles in the toc at startup, then expand the child articles by clicking on the main article. however, if i'm using the search plugin, the whole toc structure is expanded on startup and will only fold back if i refresh. could you please check if you could solve this problem? many thanks!
