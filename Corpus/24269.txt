 URL : "https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-clang/issues/189" TITLE : single line errors BODY : > only tested with c++, but errors are only displayed with one line now. > for example if a static_assert fails, the only error displayed is this > > in instantiation of function template specialization 'entity<entitymanager<crender, clocation> ::addcomponent<scene>' requested here > > where before it would show multiple lines of information about the error and the build output shows > > /home/nick/programming/opengl-project/./src/entity/entity.hpp:172:9: error: static_assert failed index called on invalid type static_assert contains<comp_t> , index called on invalid type ; ^ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ /home/nick/programming/opengl-project/./src/entity/entity.hpp:68:61: note: in instantiation of function template specialization 'entitymanager<crender, clocation>::index<scene>' requested here auto loc = m_componentids m_entitymanager->template index<comp_t> ; ^ /home/nick/programming/opengl-project/src/scene/scene.cpp:49:9: note: in instantiation of function template specialization 'entity<entitymanager<crender, clocation> >::addcomponent<scene>' requested here ent.addcomponent<scene> ; > > as you can see, it chops of the beginning of the error, while that is the most important i originally posted this in the linter repo, but ther owner said > the excerpt and description have been split into two separate fields now, to get rid of the behavior you're experiencing, you should request the linter provider owner to upgrade their package to linter v2 api so i'm guessing this error might belong here? it mostly happens when static_asserts fail
