 URL : "https://github.com/eventum/eventum/issues/281" TITLE : empty php sessions BODY : we are noticing lots of empty php sessions on our server and can't figure out how/why they are getting there. does eventum create lots of empty session data? we don't have many php applications running on our server so if it's not one of them, we are concerned there may be something malicious running.
