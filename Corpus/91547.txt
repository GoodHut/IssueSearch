 URL : "https://github.com/mgp25/Instagram-API/issues/1674" TITLE : two factor authentication BODY : hi guys, i'm building a new project using this amazing library and have run into a slight issue with 2-factor authentication. i tried following the code located at: https://github.com/mgp25/instagram-api/blob/3.1/examples/twofactorlogin.php it works fine when running via cli but as soon as you move it to a web-based interface, it's all stateless. so when the user chooses to come back and put in their sms verification code in the application, i'll have to instagram::login again which triggers a completely new request for verification code generating a new one. since instagram::_setuser is a protected function now, the only way to get to it is through instagram::login and if i do that, i can't instagram::finishtwofactorlogin ex: https://github.com/mgp25/instagram-api/blob/3.1/examples/twofactorlogin.php l27 with my old verification code. any pointers would be dearly appreciated.
