 URL : "https://github.com/AwesomePossum446/Cordial/issues/30" TITLE : implement fuzzy search BODY : as a user, sometimes i can't remember exactly what i'm searching for. it would be useful if search worked on fields other than my contact's names. for instance, if i know they had a github profile linked i could search 'github'. if i knew they had some website with 'bicycle' in the name, i could search 'bicycle' and find them.
