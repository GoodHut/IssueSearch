 URL : "https://github.com/jprante/elasticsearch-plugin-bundle/issues/36" TITLE : _langdetect rest endpoint BODY : hi j√∂rg, after a long time staying with es2.3 we decided to move on to es5.3 now. all the plugins work fine, except the _langdetect rest endpoint and i figured that even the parts of documentation i added to your langdetect repo quite a while ago seem to be obsolete now: get _langdetect { text : das ist ein test } gives me { error : { root_cause : { type : json_generation_exception , reason : can not write a field name, expecting a value } , type : json_generation_exception , reason : can not write a field name, expecting a value }, status : 500 } whereas curl -xpost 'localhost:9200/_langdetect?pretty' -d 'this is a test' returns { error : content-type header application/x-www-form-urlencoded is not supported , status :406} unfortunately our code relies pretty much on the rest endpoint for checking the language _before_ a document is indexed. the handler for _langdetect still exists and is accessible. so what am i missing? can you give me a hint, please?
