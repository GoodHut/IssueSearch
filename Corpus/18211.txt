BODY : hi ! i was trying to adjust the jibri to stream to facebook. i have changed the following parameters at the launch_recording.sh !/bin/bash url=$1 stream=$2 token=$3 youtube_stream_id=$4 export display=:0 xdotool mousemove 1280 0 youtube_base= rtmp://rtmp-api.facebook.com/rtmp if ! -z $5 ; then youtube_base= rtmp://rtmp-api.facebook.com/rtmp fi if ! -z $4 ; then stream= ${youtube_base}/${youtube_stream_id} if ! -z $5 ; then stream= ${stream}?backup=1 fi fi ./start-ffmpeg.sh $stream when i launch it via ./launch_recording.sh null null null fb_stream_key it connects to fb and there is the connecting.png showing up so it works. however, when i launch it via jitsi-meet it doesnt want to connect, i'm wondering is there any hard written youtube_rtmp url written somewhere which i missed ? thanks a lot !
