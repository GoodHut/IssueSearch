 URL : "https://github.com/TIGRLab/admin/issues/1036" TITLE : clevis user home dir BODY : in ipa server the home directory for clevis is set to /imaging/kimel/home/clevis . since we re-enrolled tigrsrv with ipa this causes the run scripts to fail as the clevis user can no-longer find it's home directory. particularly the absence of .known-hosts causes sftp to fail. for now i have symlinked /home/clevis to /imaging/kimel/home/clevis on tigrsrv. i don't have permission to update this entry in ipa. @josephdviviano - can you change this setting in ipa or do i need to bug someone upstairs?
