 URL : "https://github.com/Suyash458/WiktionaryParser/issues/9" TITLE : support for cantonese BODY : hi, thank you for this excellent parser. i am trying to run this parser on cantonese entries in wiktionary, but the are not always found, and when they are found, the data returned is... weird. for example, create a file wordcount.log that has from wiktionaryparser import wiktionaryparser import codecs import sys parser = wiktionaryparser with open 'wiktionary_data.txt', w as outfile: with codecs.open wordcount.log , r , encoding= utf-8 as infile: for line in infile: word = line.split 0 wiktionaryword = parser.fetch word, chinese if len wiktionaryword > 0: outfile.write word.encode 'utf-8' + , + str wiktionaryword 0 +
