 URL : "https://github.com/ToroCraft/NemesisSystem/issues/77" TITLE : nemesis daily activities BODY : it'd be nice if every day that starts up the player can get a notification that a certain nemesis is doing a certain thing in a set area. like say, if theres a village there could be a mission to go to the center of a position of a village that was spawned in the world and activate a mission where the nemesis comes and pillages the village at night. or them calling you out for a fight or it saying that they're out hunting, meaning that they could magically turn up at the completely wrong moment out of the blue from any normal spawn and kick your ass into space and stuff like that. so much potential right here. keep it going. :d ~darkmega18 https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/nemesis-system?comment=19
