 URL : "https://github.com/bancika/diy-layout-creator/issues/325" TITLE : high dpi issues BODY : the following issues were noted when running the app on a 220 dpi screen 15 at 4k resolution , both windows tested under w10 and linux tested under fedora with gnome wayland are affected. i am using the default dpi scaling of 200% under linux and 250% under windows. - the rulers are very small and the numbers are not legible. - the component menu is not large enough to display all component names and cannot be resized. - the folder rows in the component menu are not tall enough and the text is truncated. only the folders are affected, the components themselves seem to have taller rows and look fine. - the icons are very small, such as the search icon, the 4 icons at the bottom right of the screen, the auto-scroll icon and all other icons in the menus. - the rows in the bom windows are not tall enough which makes the text illegible. ! capture1 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7825368/28220326-0932f400-688d-11e7-99a5-6200901444e3.png ! capture2 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7825368/28220330-0aeab1c0-688d-11e7-86ba-74857f2822cd.png
