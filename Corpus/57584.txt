 URL : "https://github.com/namlit/siteswap_generator/issues/10" TITLE : random generation mode BODY : normally the siteswaps are generated systematically in an ordered way. however, for very long long periods, you are typically not interested in generating all possible siteswaps, but only some interesting ones. with the systematically approach, the first generated siteswaps are usually quite boring and one needs to generate really a lot of siteswaps, to find an interesting one. therefore it would be nice to have a random generation mode for long siteswaps.
