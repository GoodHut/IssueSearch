 URL : "https://github.com/elc1798/alice/issues/1" TITLE : slow speech to text BODY : since google sr api is cloud based, the speech-to-text is throttled by network speed and can be extremely slow at times. there aren't many non-based speech-to-text apis for python, but i may write a wrapper for http://voce.sourceforge.net/ with an implementation in both c++ and java for compatibility and fun's sake to test out some on-the-fly, locally computed speech to text. eventually, i may write my own, if i find that the libraries are insufficient at filtering noise, etc. or if i just want to play around and learn how to do it on my own.
