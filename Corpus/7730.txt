 URL : "https://github.com/coredump-ch/rpsrtsrs/issues/56" TITLE : implement lobby BODY : currently the server behaves very simple and just creates new players as soon as they connect into the running game. ideally the server should have two states: lobby game running in lobby mode clients can connect and the game can be configured number of players, size of the map, start locations, number of units, ... . when the game has started, connects shouldn't be possible anymore, only reconnects maybe protected with a token . when the game ends, we should be back in lobby mode.
