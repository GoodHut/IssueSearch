 URL : "https://github.com/za419/VersionControl/issues/10" TITLE : feature directory support BODY : for now, file operations remove all directory information and place files directly in the working directory we really, really need to not keep this. directories are very important, and we need to preserve them through a commit and checkout. therefore: - add needs to store information in some form about where the files in the index were sourced - commit needs to store this information in the commit - checkout will use the commit information to place the file back in its original location
