 URL : "https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations/issues/54" TITLE : feature/unittest to pytest BODY : this pull request modifies the code base to increase compatibility between python 2 and python 3. at present, running python -m unittest as well as nosetests from the root directory gives 4 failures. two of the failures come from small inaccuracies in the distributional expectations output. the other two failures are due to type mismatch in the output format, likely caused because of type handling differences in python 2 vs 3.
