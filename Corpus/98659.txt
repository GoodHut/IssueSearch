 URL : "https://github.com/developit/unfetch/issues/25" TITLE : jsnext:main / module build BODY : at the moment jsnext:main respectively module points to src/index.js . this leads to the situation where the consuming package / application needs to transpile unfetch as well in their build because older browsers don't understand arrow functions and so on. jsnext:main or module code should always already be transpiled. the only difference is that they use es6 module syntax instead of commonjs function calls. see also https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/2902 issuecomment-241608119 and pkg.module in rollup https://github.com/rollup/rollup/wiki/pkg.module wait-it-just-means-import-and-export--not-other-future-javascript-features :relaxed:
