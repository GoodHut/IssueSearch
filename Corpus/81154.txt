 URL : "https://github.com/karol-f/vue-custom-element/issues/12" TITLE : vue versions interfering BODY : it's my understanding that i should be able to run vue v1.x globally on the page and use a custom element using vue v2.x, since the custom element is sandboxed inside itself. my main.js looks as such: js import vue from 'vue' import vuecustomelement from 'vue-custom-element/src/vue-custom-element' vue.use vuecustomelement import app from './app' vue.customelement 'test-app', app my index.html looks as such: js <!doctype html> <html> <head> <meta charset= utf-8 > <title>vue-custom-element</title> <script src= https://unpkg.com/vue@1.0.28/dist/vue.min.js ></script> </head> <body> <test-app></test-app> <!-- built files will be auto injected --> </body> </html> i'm simply loading in vue v1.0.28 as a proof of concept, however i get a webpack error in the browser, after a successful compile, customelement is not a function . after some digging and debugging, the instance of vue that's available to the vue-custom-element install method is actually the vue v1 instance.
