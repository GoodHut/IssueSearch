 URL : "https://github.com/jhillyerd/enmime/issues/31" TITLE : provide mimes in order BODY : per rfc 1341 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1341 : in general, choosing the best type means displaying only the last part that can be displayed. with the current implementation, it is hard to determine mime part ordering. additionally, enmime drains the content from html and text parts, making it hard to interact with each mime part as a whole entity. ideally, the api would allow for something like: get a slice of mime parts mimeparts := readmime reader for _, part := range mimeparts { mapofheaders := part.headers // map string string easyaccesstocommonheader := part.contenttype // have other helpers maybe, like to , from , or get header slice by string, get charset, etc rawbytes := part.rawcontent decoded := part.decodedcontent // uses the detected charset and content type } this allows a client to know the order and present the best display and allows for easily parsing the mime entities. ideally, someone should be able to stitch this information back together and create the nearly identical email from the parts.
