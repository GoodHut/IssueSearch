 URL : "https://github.com/frankiefu/pica/issues/1" TITLE : app drawer doesn't open BODY : i just cloned the repo and tested it with the steps in the readme. but when i open the site in chrome: 1. the app drawer icon disappears when my window width is over 1280px so then i can't navigate. 2. even with a width under 1280px when the icon is visible, clicking it does nothing . the app draw doesn't open like it does in the demo https://frankiefu.github.io/pica/ . i think it must be caused by newer versions of dependencies that bower installed? i don't know what the exact problem is but i want to figure this out because i was looking at this app to learn how to build my own app..
