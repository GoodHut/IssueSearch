 URL : "https://github.com/tomek199/elo-rating/issues/106" TITLE : filter non active players BODY : idea. maybe we don't have to disable non active players. maybe we could add to dashboard smth like filter - 'only players that played match last month'. i would be happy to contribute it, however it would be nice to have other opinion. the problem is that poor active players could loose motivation to play if despite their efforts they are further in ranking then people that hadn't been playing for longer time.
