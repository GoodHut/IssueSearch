 URL : "https://github.com/mateidavid/zstr/issues/5" TITLE : strerror problem on a mac BODY : the various ifdef s at the beginning of strict_fstream.hpp that determine how to interact with strerror_r break for me on a mac. specifically, it drops into the third, gnu-specific case, but it should be using the second one. i quickly fixed my local copy by adding defined __apple__ to the second case, but i'm not sure if it's the correct universal fix.
