 URL : "https://github.com/ably/ably-js-nativescript/issues/3" TITLE : use ably-js repo typings BODY : @nathanaela there's now a typescript definitions file in the ably-js repo https://github.com/ably/ably-js/blob/master/ably.d.ts ; would it be possible for nativescript to use that, so we only have one definitions file to keep in sync with ably-js changes? they seem to be in slightly different formats atm the ably-js one uses a namespace so not sure if there's any work needed before nativescript can use it
