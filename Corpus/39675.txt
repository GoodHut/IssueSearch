 URL : "https://github.com/NSLS-II/wishlist/issues/123" TITLE : sos: grouping motors BODY : @danielballan @tacaswell i would need some help/assistance in defining a set of pseudo motors or equivalent . unfortunately, i realized just now that we need this feature implemented in order to progress with the current experiment beamtime ends monday morning . the idea is that we have sets of couples of motors mot1a and mot1b, mot2a and mot2b, .. and we need to move them as a package the 1s together, the 2s together in order to mesh them package 1 against package 2, for example . a relative movement will be indeed sufficient. how to do it properly? a dedicated plan with outer inner suitably nested? i tried sketching something based on ophyd pseudopositioner but i would like to be sure before making mess and risking the experiment. please let me know asap, thanks.
