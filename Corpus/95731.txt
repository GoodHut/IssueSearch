 URL : "https://github.com/Tealium/tealium-ios/issues/31" TITLE : disable logging to console BODY : i might be missing something obvious, but how do i disable the xcode console logging from the tealium library? i'm not seeing any obvious api on either tealium or tealconfiguration . i only want to see tealium's log output when i'm working on my analytics implementation. the rest of the time i need it off so i can see my own useful debug logging.
