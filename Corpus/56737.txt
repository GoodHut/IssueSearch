 URL : "https://github.com/digidem/mapeo-desktop/issues/82" TITLE : npm v4.10 breaks build BODY : the build script pre- f73ca76859ea0ebe4e6c796529f3e02ec866170c would install latest npm, which recently has been v4. builds were broken because any dependencies that were listed as both dependencies and devdependencies were not included in the package. this did not happen when running locally in dev environment , so likely related to production environment, and the pruning done by electron packager. the temporary fix is to lock to npm v3, but we should probably figure out where this bug is for future compatibility.
