 URL : "https://github.com/acdlite/redux-actions/issues/199" TITLE : namespace for reducers BODY : so, you have mentioned that there is available possibility to add namespace for action creators. like below for example : javascript const actioncreators = createactions { user: { create_item: data => { data } , delete_item: ... => ..., get_list: ... => ..., ... } } ; but how i can create namespace for reducers, like for such trivial operations as crud. example: javascript // creating crud reducer template const crudreducertemplate = { create_item: state, action => ..., delete_item: ... => ..., get_list: ... => ..., ... }; // creating reducer for users' crud operations const userreducers = handleaction { user: { ...crudreducertemplate } }, / default state here / ; // creating reducer for articles' crud operations const articlereducers = handleaction { article: { ...crudreducertemplate } }, / default state here / ; is it possible to do with your utile? thanks.
