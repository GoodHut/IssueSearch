 URL : "https://github.com/Phaetec/pogo-cruncher/issues/96" TITLE : update pokemon database BODY : new pokemon are coming and our database is not up-to-date. it would be nice if you help us keeping our database ready and filled with all pokemon needed. currently it is stored in https://github.com/phaetec/pogo-cruncher/blob/master/frontend/src/cruncher/data/pokemon.cljs you can also provide them as json file or similar and i will convert it to our scheme. the last database was from an older iv analyzer, which is no longer supported.
