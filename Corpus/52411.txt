 URL : "https://github.com/algorithmiaio/dev-center/issues/54" TITLE : client guides missing? BODY : not sure if this is on purpose, but i came across a few client guides that tell users to go to github for the guide. this feels like a missed opportunity to help devs get started faster. <img width= 1159 alt= screen shot 2017-01-25 at 1 56 48 pm src= https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2197111/22311011/56b5b8d2-e306-11e6-9c59-13c60e91e091.png > the dev center is suppose to be the one place with the collected knowledge for getting started with algorithmia. shipping users off to github shows a lack of respect for our user. i look at what firebase does with their dev center. they have this great guide for getting started with the firebase tool cli : https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli/ but they also have this github repo: https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools the former is the comprehensive getting started guide. the latter is the repo with the client and a stripped down list of reference commands. both are helpful, but for different reasons: the former is for the n00bs, the latter is for the person already familiar.
