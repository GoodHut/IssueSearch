 URL : "https://github.com/bos/text-icu/issues/33" TITLE : support for icu 59.1 BODY : not sure if this is the right place for this but when attempting to build haskell-ide-engine which relies on text-icu as a dependency, it complains about the following: library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/icu4c/lib/libicuuc.58.dylib however when running brew install icu4c , it installs the latest version which is 59.1 . does support for icu 59.1 need to be added to text-icu or is this issue just unrelated? more info regarding the error message can be found here https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine/issues/303.
