 URL : "https://github.com/joemccann/dillinger/issues/652" TITLE : service worker support BODY : after working on this repo, i feel that it would be suited to use a service worker. what are people's thoughts on this? pros: - offline support in servicer worker enabled browsers https://jakearchibald.github.io/isserviceworkerready/ - could implement a cache first approach, so even online users on intermittent or slow connections have a better experience - add to homescreen/ progressive web app support on android devices cons: - the offline experience would not include some features, although that would likely be expected for an offline user - adds potential development overhead, e.g. learning curve for people who haven't used service worker before
