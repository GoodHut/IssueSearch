 URL : "https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/431" TITLE : kill off pex_python BODY : the pex runtime currently supports a configuration for a pex_python variable in a pexrc file. this variable allows a user to define a python interpreter to override the default interpreter when executing the pex. this has been replaced by a pex_python_path variable, that allows the user to specify a colon-separated list of paths to python interpreters with the aim of being able support interpreter selection against a list of interpreter override candidates. the goal of this issue is to completely kill off pex_python support in the pex codebase in favor of the new pex_python_path pexrc variable.
