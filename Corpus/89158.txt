 URL : "https://github.com/BEEmod/BEE2-items/issues/1318" TITLE : portal magnet enhancement BODY : there have been a couple times when i had a portalable surface in the floor and i wanted to add a portal magnet that would center the portal but allow more than one angle. most notably under a light bridge where i wanted both the light bridge at the top and the light bridge at the bottom at different times in the puzzle. i was wondering if it would be possible to modify the magnet tool so that you could stack them on the floor rotated at the 4 different angles and it would open the portal magnet in the orientation that most closely matched the angle the player was shooting from? alternatively would it be possible to add 'start reversed' or the like in order to enable the centered portals but oriented 180Â° apart depending on where the player was shooting from?
