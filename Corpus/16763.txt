 URL : "https://github.com/RoadrunnerWMC/Newer-Credits-Editor/issues/2" TITLE : lots of weirdness BODY : ! credits editor not working https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27451052/27508680-7a41e19a-58b8-11e7-8f8c-2c6ea9d8f3f7.png i have tried my best to find out what is wrong, but honestly, i can't do much seeing as i barely understand python and i run a windows computer with python, etc. downloaded onto it. i had no idea what was wrong so i decided to run winbuild.py instead. interestingly, it will not run unless i open it and delete the beginning comments with signs. once i do run it, it creates a distrib folder. previously, it said i didn't have the credits editor py file in the distrib folder, so i put it in there, ran it again, and boom. distrib overwrites itself and the credits editor py file is gone. that doesn't matter, because i just redownloaded the entire thing, but i have no idea what i am supposed to do. all in all, this really isn't urgent because i don't actually need to edit the credits as of now but it would be nice to have a fix within the next six months ðŸ˜ƒ p.s. if this is way too much information/not enough information, please let me know.
