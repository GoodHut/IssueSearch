 URL : "https://github.com/nulab/scala-oauth2-provider/issues/111" TITLE : consider using scalafmt BODY : i'd be curious of your thoughts of adding scalafmt https://olafurpg.github.io/scalafmt/ to this library? it would make it easier to contribute to as code formatting would be consistently applied and even have tests fail if a contribution comes in that is not formatted to the scalafmt settings. if you consider it, i might suggest these format settings in the .scalafmt.conf file: style = defaultwithalign maxcolumn = 120
