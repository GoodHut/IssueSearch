 URL : "https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-sdk-cpp/issues/9" TITLE : issue with aws region BODY : hi, i pulled the latest update and tested the aws region related fix issue 7 . ============================================================== debug - awaiting for the stream to become ready... warn - http error 403: response: { message : the security token included in the request is invalid. } request url: https://kinesisvideo. us-west-2 .amazonaws.com/describestream_ ============================================================== the api uri still contains us-west-2. i think the following code in defaultcallbackprovider.cpp is the root cause. 951 if control_plane_uri_.empty { 952 // create a fully qualified uri 953 control_plane_uri_ = control_plane_uri_prefix 954 + kinesis_video_service_name 955 + . 956 + default_aws_region 957 + control_plane_uri_postfix; i replaced the variable default_aws_region with the variable region and tested it locally. the app is now picking up the correct api uri. this may not be the right fix. the relationship between the variables region and control_plane_uri must be analyzed in detail to identify the appropriate fix. thanks babu srinivasan
