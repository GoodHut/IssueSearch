i can't click on any of the buttons in the tui. clicking on names does nothing, neither does clicking on the pluses. also probably related, when on the tui page, i can't expand the issues sidebar, and none of the little icons show up when scrolling over the content page. i think the two issues are linked, since this happens only on the tui page. using firefox 7.0.1 also tested with chrome 13.0.782.215, same result on ubuntu 11.04.
