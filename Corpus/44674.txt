 URL : "https://github.com/adamdriscoll/poshtools/issues/553" TITLE : first user experience BODY : this is my experience with the product. for sure there will be a next one in the future. this is how it went now. visual studio advertises the product to me in a ps script window. i think, cool. after installing and heading to the script pane, i expect to find around some sort of ps console and/or execute-script button. my fault, i have to read the docs. __getting the docs__ on the gallery page ctrl+f doc does not help. i see a github link, go there. the same: no getting-started, no doc/man folders. this time there is a link to the author's page. i am brought to a beautiful travel blog sort of , advertising a paid version of the product. google is my friend and i find a 3rd product page and a gitbook website with the docs. what about a big link on the very first project page to the docs website? __first things first__ i happily find my ps console and the context menu. i am done. i can start debugging my script in vs. i try to click on the left bar to set a breakpoint without luck. strange, the product is advertised as a debugger. indeed the context menu shows a breakpoint item. i click insert but nothing happens, or better, when i run the script, it is stuck. again my fault, read the docs. __local debugging and syntax highlighting__ there is a doc section: local debugging. it starts with a long how-to to attach to a local process... what? i just need a shortcut to a breakpoint. at this time, looking at the doc screenshots, i realise that the cool highlighting and glitters, which captured me in the first place, are missing in my case. my ps script pane has the same black-on-white theme of notepad.exe. i also see that i have already finished my second pomodoro session, without even starting to write a line. at the moment the context menu open with ps ise is the only effective option. but i will have a second attempt. the project is cool and surely, as the usage goes, the experience will get more streamlined.
