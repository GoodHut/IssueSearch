 URL : "https://github.com/Atmosphere/wasync/issues/155" TITLE : simple http pooling BODY : hi, from my understanding of the atmosphere specification, simple http pooling should be available : https://github.com/atmosphere/wasync/wiki/atmosphere-client-specification-1.0 transports-supported i can't find anywhere. due to the lack of async servlet on our application server, coupled with the sudden influx of 16k clients, we need a simple http pooling to avoid an explosion of threads on our servers. we're currently using http long-polling. the servers will be upgraded at the end of next year and we should be able to use websockets at the same time. in the meantime though, we're stuck with a suboptimal solution of simple http pooling. did i miss something ? would it be possible to develop a simple implementation of simple http pooling on our end or would that be a daunting task ? thanks for your help.
