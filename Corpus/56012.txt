 URL : "https://github.com/ecederstrand/exchangelib/issues/233" TITLE : manage filtering rules BODY : hi, it would be really nice to be able to manage inbox rules i.e. for mail filtering from exchangelib . i've had a bit of a look in the code base, but don't really know what i'm doing here. i think this would need: - a conditions class which i think can be built using existing field types - an exceptions class which would need calling something else! similar to the above - an actions class some of the elements of which are easy, some of which are harder - a rules class which contains the above and some simpler elements and then methods to getinboxrules, createruleoperation and setruleoperation. it feels like this ought to be fairly straightforward plumbing for someone who is familiar with the code base, but i don't really know where to start. i'd be happy to test some code that did these things and write a ui on top of them, or perhaps could try some of the sub-tasks given a few more hints of the way to make the plumbing work...? thanks, and sorry for a slightly vague request!
