 URL : "https://github.com/shaman33/web_app_firewall/issues/27" TITLE : illegally blocked scripts BODY : hi shaman, i have just installed this waf and put it in the learn mode since yesterday. according to the description, it is not supposed to block anything in the learn mode, right? however, i experience the blocking of certain scripts on my site. it is a record-keeping site and i discovered that i could enter records for storage but, when the same records are to be listed, they are not listed. the waf access log shows the relevant pages to be blocked showing the variables that are responsible for displaying the stored records from database . how is this so? i think the algorithm for classifying files to be blocked need to be reviewed. in learning mode, most of scripts i use for processing jobs are witheld in the access map and showed as blocked...even in learning mode. two things: its either i don't understand how the waf behaves or something is wrong with its implementation. cheers!!!
