 URL : "https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/127" TITLE : issues with viewers BODY : this was in an email, but i'm putting it here so that it doesn't get lost. i've noticed two odd things -- i don't know if this is related to the work you've recently been doing. first, tooltips are flashing in an odd way, as at the top of the transcription on this page: http://livingstoneonline.org/islandora/search?access=view_spectral&view_pid=liv%3a002570&view_page=0 second, you'll note note in the ms viewer and in the multiviewer there's an odd additonal scrollbar that doesn't work. see attached screen shots. this appears to be tied to the height of the iframe which seems to need to be turned off. ! screen shot 2017-01-24 at 20 26 53 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12518623/22488204/57d13b7c-e7d6-11e6-82c2-2eaaa9e8bacb.png ! screen shot 2017-01-24 at 20 26 56 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12518623/22488203/57d0b1ca-e7d6-11e6-8d6d-5dfd5e067a1a.png
