 URL : "https://github.com/blue-yonder/tsfresh/issues/354" TITLE : predicting future values BODY : i am using tsfresh for feature extraction for one of the time series problem. i have to predict the daily closing balance for around 100 commercial accounts. now i train and fit my data till say 12/22 available data and have to predict 7 days in future. how do i do this efficiently? my approach: a. predict the target variable amount for 12/22. b. append it to my original timeseries and feed it as input to feature extraction process to get relevant features. c. train and fit the new model d. predict for 12/23 e. repeat a through d for 7 days not sure if this is the best way to approach this situation so reaching out to you to check if there is any function/method with tsfresh that would allow me to save all this computation and fitting over and over again. thanks, aakash
