 URL : "https://github.com/onelogin/python-saml/issues/207" TITLE : multiple acss url BODY : i am trying to evaluate python-saml for enabling our sp with saml functionality. how do i keep track of the authnrequest for each login request ? 1 can i send acs url in authnrequest..perhaps append each acs url with unique id ? the id later can be looked when idp sends the response to figure for which login request this was for ? 2 or if i could add some index number in the authnrequest sent, which i can later match in the response message recevied back from idp ? i was looking up the api description and could not find much help there. appreciate if someone can help me with example code. thanks asif
