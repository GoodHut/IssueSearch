 URL : "https://github.com/philc/vimium/issues/2519" TITLE : make f-mode matches stable BODY : i find that since they change between invocations of the f /especially the f command, i often end up clicking something i didn't want to click. for a given page load, it would be nice if those values remained stable. my thoughts were to cache them in memory after they've been assigned, and upon hitting f / f again, fill in the cached ones first before assigning the rest. i don't know how this code works so if i have time i'll read up a bit later, but if someone else can chime in about the feasibility of this sort of thing that would be dope!
