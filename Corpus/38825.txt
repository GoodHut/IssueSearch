 URL : "https://github.com/unipsycho/LabVIEWdotNetDataGrid/issues/25" TITLE : read only per column BODY : hi, i'm looking at using this in an application and need certain columns to be read only. i've pulled the source and see you can do this per table in the latest commits. is there a reason to not just add a read only property to the column setup definition? i will be doing this or something similar from my project so can submit it back if desired.
