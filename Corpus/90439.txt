 URL : "https://github.com/microservices-demo/front-end/issues/65" TITLE : shippable pipeline broken BODY : the tag name change to master-<8 char commit sha> introduced in commit 55ae946 works fine and the image with the proper tag is pushed to the repository but the shippable pipeline doesn't pick it up properly. the deploy step to test fails when executing /home/shippable/micro/nod/stepexec/managed/deploy/run.sh and looking at the failed ecs tasks the error message is like this: status reason	cannotpullcontainererror: error: image front-end: master.2 not found . with the new tagging master.2 does not exist anymore and instead it should use master-<8 char commit sha> .
