 URL : "https://github.com/mantoni/eslint_d.js/issues/62" TITLE : support for prettier BODY : hey @mantoni i've recently started trying out prettier https://github.com/jlongster/prettier along with prettier-eslint https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier-eslint . it'd be great to somehow be able to have eslint_d run code through prettier before passing it to fix. i could build it in as an explicit feature is it weird to couple eslint_d to a completely different tool? or i could make some sort of prefilter plugin interface... ideally i could use something like eslint-plugin-prettier https://github.com/not-an-aardvark/eslint-plugin-prettier but i have rules that disagree w/ prettier, so it won't work int hat way. thoughts?
