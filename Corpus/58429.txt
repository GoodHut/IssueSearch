 URL : "https://github.com/Netflix/Priam/issues/581" TITLE : simpledb cost estimate BODY : before starting to use priam, i'd like to have some idea about the expected simpledb-related usage costs. our initial cluster will have 6 nodes. 1. simpledb machine utilization - is it expected to remain under 25 hours? if not, how many hours is priam expected to use? 2. simpledb data transfer out - is it expected to remain under 1 gb? if not, what will the data consumption be? 3. simpledb structured data storage - am i correct in assuming that the data size will not be above 1gb?
