 URL : "https://github.com/vfarcic/jenkins-docker-ansible/issues/10" TITLE : no longer working BODY : error: ==> cd: fatal: localhost : failed! => { changed : false, failed : true, msg : error: docker-py version is 1.6.0. minimum version required is 1.7.0. } i assume this is because you didn't lock the ansible version being installed and it now has newer requirements. i can work on a pr to fix this if you'd like, but don't want to spend the time if you're ignoring prs. i see an old pr that needs to be merged that has been ignored up to this point...
