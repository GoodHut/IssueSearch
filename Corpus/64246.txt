 URL : "https://github.com/openSUSE/geekodoc/issues/32" TITLE : forbid xml:id on remark BODY : not quite sure if that is really possible but it would be great if we could just forbid xml:id attrs on <remark/> tags in geekodoc. i will in shah cthulhu also add some code to the style checker regarding this -- if this can be fixed in geekodoc, i can do that just for elements nested within remark, otherwise i'd do it for both remark and elements nested within.
