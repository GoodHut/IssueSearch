 URL : "https://github.com/zeit/pkg/issues/284" TITLE : phantomjs pdf generation BODY : pkg version : 4.2.5 cmd line: pkg -t node8-linux-x64 package.json --output n i have an issue using pkg with the reasonably popular npm package https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-pdf at first i had an error due to the phantomjs binary not being included. warning cannot include file %1 into executable. the file must be distributed with executable as %2. node_modules/phantomjs-prebuilt/lib/phantom/bin/phantomjs path-to-executable/phantom/phantomjs without the file i would get the following error error: spawn /home/cw/development/myproject/myprojectdir/phantom/phantomjs enoent however including the proposed binary was enough to get rid of this error, but i am now faced with the following error error: can't open '/snapshot/myproject/myprojectdir/node_modules/html-pdf/lib/scripts/pdf_a4_portrait.js' can you advise me on how to proceed debugging?
