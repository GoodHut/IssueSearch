 URL : "https://github.com/concrete5-community-store/community_store/issues/302" TITLE : &deg; in product name BODY : i've brought this up before and i thought i found a work around, but when trying to edit the pages it changed the code &deg; to an actual ° which is fine, but it still crashes my site when trying to edit it. so for me to edit these pages i'll have to manual change every ° to &deg; if there is no way around this, i'll make so, but could there be an easy fix to show the ° but not try to enter it on the url line?
