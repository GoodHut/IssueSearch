 URL : "https://github.com/golang/dep/issues/1305" TITLE : dep does not handle ^c BODY : i've raised several issues recently 1060, 1304 and there have been others raised previously that have the same root cause: the results of an operation which is canceled with ^c are not well tested. please consider this a placeholder issue for the wider problems of making sure dep runs are idempotent.
