 URL : "https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/issues/3741" TITLE : bridging icann and opennic BODY : i'd like mastodon on opennic to be able to talk to icann-only instances and vice-versa, through the use of multiple domains. an opennic instance would have an opennic domain and an icann domain. both domains would be functionally equivalent. this opennic-icann bridge instance would be able to talk to both icann-only and opennic-only instances, and boost content from opennic-only instances to icann-only instances and vice-versa. is this possible? this is different from 1211 as far as boost content from opennic-only instances to icann-only instances and vice-versa is concerned: yes, you need multiple domains for that, but how would the boosting work? technically, you'd be boosting content from either network onto the bridge , then others would boost from the bridge onto the other network , but what happens if you do? - x i searched or browsed the repoâ€™s other issues to ensure this is not a duplicate. - this bug happens on a tagged release https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/releases and not on master if you're a user, don't worry about this .
