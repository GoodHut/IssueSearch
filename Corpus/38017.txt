 URL : "https://github.com/Project-Bonfire/Bonfire/issues/17" TITLE : no docs for crossbar BODY : on the bottom of credit-based-router https://github.com/project-bonfire/bonfire/wiki/credit-based-router wiki page there is a link to xbar crossbar switch for passing data to output https://github.com/project-bonfire/bonfire/wiki/xbar-%28crossbar-switch%29-%28for-passing-data-to-output%29 , but the page does not exist. sure, the xbar module itself is fairly trivial, but i'm creating an issue anyway so that the red link on the wiki does not slip through the cracks. after all, i guess some useful info was supposed to be there?
