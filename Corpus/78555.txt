 URL : "https://github.com/zzzprojects/EntityFramework.DynamicFilters/issues/120" TITLE : q about table attributes BODY : hi! we have a number of applications which use a shared library to access a common database sql server . however, each application would like to define it's own filters - some using soft delete, some using tenancy, some only seeing most recent versions and so on. i was hoping to do this by defining a basedbcontext in the shared library and then have each application define a customdbcontext extending basedbcontext and declaring the required filters there. this, however, doesn't work, as each filter gets mapped to a table attribute, so the framework will always think the database is out of sync with the model. the only solution i can see is to define all the filters in the shared library. unfortunately, this means that if we need to define a new filter for a single application, we must release new versions of all programs and do a database migration? are there other options?
