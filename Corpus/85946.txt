 URL : "https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/2044" TITLE : general project structure BODY : i see this in build.gradle > this project was started in eclipse and later moved to android studio. in the transition, both ides were supported. > due to this, the files layout is not the usual in new projects created with android studio / gradle. this file > merges declarations usually split in two separates build.gradle file, one for global settings of the project in > its root folder, another one for the app module in subfolder of root. guys, eclipse and android are no team any more, and this makes no sense since 2015 ! i would like to make an pr to change project structure with an app directory, like most android apps are, but when i see how much open pr's are there i see no chance doing this. am i right ?
