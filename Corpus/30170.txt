 URL : "https://github.com/PolymerElements/generator-polymer-init-custom-build/issues/61" TITLE : npm run build fails BODY : while following the docs on a totally clean system only npm installed, no global modules , i ran into some errors when running 'npm run build'. first i got the error : no such file or directory which was caused by not having gulp-cli installed second, it reported a missing 'webcomponents-lite.min.js', because i hadn't run 'bower install'. so npm install gulp-cli && bower install seem necessary with the current version. can you update the readme to add the missing steps? thanks, bart
