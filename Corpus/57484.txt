 URL : "https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool/issues/118" TITLE : python 3 compatibility BODY : at the moment esmvaltool is not python 3 compatible. python 2 end of life is currently scheduled for 2020 https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/ , which is slightly over 2 years from now. therefore it would be good to start supporting python 3. list of currently known issues that prevent python 3 compatibility: - issue 18: relative imports in python 2 style - occasional print statement without brackets - circle-ci is not set up to run tests in python 3 i would be happy to start fixing the issues above. list of dependencies that have issues: - python 3 version of esgf-pyclient not available in conda but can be installed using pip - python 3 version of easytest not available in conda but can be installed using pip - python 3 version of scientificpython not available in conda is this package used anywhere? i cannot find a single import scientific statement
