BODY : hi, i made a campaign using an email from gmail , sending it to two recipients of my company. the email arrived. i opened the email but did not update the open status on the dashboard yet. how long does it take for the status to refresh? i did not click on the link and noticed that they were changed, to the address i set in the campaign. interesting... so, i think! is my antispam system flawed? should he block? thank you.
