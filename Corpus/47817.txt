 URL : "https://github.com/RigoBlock/SolidityCasper/issues/4" TITLE : purpose/goals of repo BODY : hey! i just wanted to get a sense of your goals with this repository. are you looking port the full viper implementation to solidity? i've been considering doing so and to write a unit-test suite to test against both solidity and viper implementations. this interface is obviously a great place to start. if you're interested in going down that road, we should discuss further and choose how we want to implement tests. cheers!
