 URL : "https://github.com/IvoLimmen/photoarchive/issues/11" TITLE : better pattern system BODY : might be better to create a pattern that is more easy to parse. and a system that can optionally add prefixes or postfixes. for instance: {yyyy}-{mm}-{dd}{-cc} the { } are used for grouping and if there is no gps information only the date will be used for creating directories. so the '-' outside of the patterns are always created but when inside as shown with the cc pattern it will only be created if the gps location is found and a country code is available.
