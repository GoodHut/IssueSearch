 URL : "https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder/issues/2638" TITLE : remove rpc wrappers BODY : under amqp, we had interfaces core/interfaces.go and wrappers that would serialize and deserialize request objects. these tended to have bugs, and were painful to update when we added new rpcs or new arguments to existing rpcs. we copied this style in the move to grpc to minimize changes, and provide a compatibility layer. however, now that the move is done, we can remove the wrappers. this should simplify the code and make it easier to add new rpcs and modify arguments to rpcs. this will involve having rpc clients construct request objects directly. an example of this style can be seen in https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder/pull/2513.
