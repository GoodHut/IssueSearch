 URL : "https://github.com/grandnode/grandnode/issues/166" TITLE : use identity 2 BODY : hello, i never understood why nopcommerce created their own cookie auth implementation. it is very annoying, especially when you have to manage all the different plugins for external authentication twitter auth for example is not available . i understand that you use the same mechanism as nopcommerce for compatibility and migration purposes. however, since grandnode is fairly new, i am sure that implementing asp.net identity would drive more users from nopcommerce to grandnode. thank you in advance for considering my suggestion.
