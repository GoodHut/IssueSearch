 URL : "https://github.com/flurry/flurry-adapter-admob-ios/issues/7" TITLE : testing project failed BODY : i installed flurry adapter by cocoapods in my project but i only install for main target, not testing target. however, i got linking error like this when i trying to test my project _objc_class_$_flurryadtargeting , referenced from: objc-class-ref in libflurryadapter.a gadmadapterflurryappcircle.o _objc_class_$_flurryadnative , referenced from: objc-class-ref in libflurryadapter.a gadmadapterflurryappcircle.o _objc_class_$_flurryadinterstitial , referenced from: objc-class-ref in libflurryadapter.a gadmadapterflurryappcircle.o _objc_class_$_flurryadbanner , referenced from: objc-class-ref in libflurryadapter.a gadmadapterflurryappcircle.o _objc_class_$_flurry , referenced from: objc-class-ref in libflurryadapter.a gadmadapterflurryappcircle.o i know the error is caused by that testing target doesn't have flurry-ios-sdk/flurryads . but i feel weird to install flurry-ios-sdk/flurryads in testing target. is anyone have same issue or solution for this? thanks a lot
