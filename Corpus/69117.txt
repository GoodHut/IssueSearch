 URL : "https://github.com/shoutem/ui/issues/125" TITLE : strange styling applied BODY : hi, i've just incorporated shoutemui onto my react native app and found that the buttons on a navigationbar appear not centralized with the text on the middle and that the button appears like it is not styled, and an image within a scrollview is set as if it was float:left instead of centered aswell. i'll try to upload a photo later on, but do i need to import something more for all the styling to work rather than what i need from the @shoutem/ui ? maybe the fact that they are being instanced by the navigatorios react native component is changing the styles? i'm really motivated to use this ui library and would not like to dismiss it for probably simple things. p.s. i've had an issue with the navigation bar that was solved on an issue by passing the stylename 'inline'. i had to delve into github and issues to identify the solution, when it could be as simple as looking into the documentation if that styling was defined there. when is the documentation going to be updated?
