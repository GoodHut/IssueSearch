 URL : "https://github.com/qzind/tray/issues/231" TITLE : html content scaling BODY : there's a bug with html printing in 2.1 when switching between rasterize: false and rasterize: true during print jobs. qz tray version: 2.1.0-rc2 https://github.com/tresf/tray/releases/tag/v2.1.0-rc2 this issue was exposed when having issues with an html page scaling all the way to the right margin, but following the below steps will reproduce a similar issue with the sample html content. let me know if you would like an html sample for reproducing the horizontal scaling issue. 1. print html with the below config, note result var config = qz.configs.create 'pdfcreator',{rasterize: false} ; ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12505463/30141697-051b1ea4-934b-11e7-8fa8-41dcbc770a11.png 1. change config to rasterize: true and observe different sizing var config = qz.configs.create 'pdfcreator',{rasterize: true} ; ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12505463/30141746-42198bb0-934b-11e7-9830-c0e59146f29c.png 1. change config back to rasterize: false and observe sizing matches the print with rasterize: true , and is different than the first print, despite identical configs var config = qz.configs.create 'pdfcreator',{rasterize: false} ; ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12505463/30141793-93d2fffe-934b-11e7-8fd2-42dd6b4eae07.png 1. if you restart qz tray, the size will be the same as in print 1.
