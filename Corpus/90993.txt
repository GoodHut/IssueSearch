 URL : "https://github.com/phan/phan/issues/1343" TITLE : support for option arrays BODY : as shown here in the proposal for phpdoc fig standard: https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/phpdoc.md examples-12 basically looks like this / initializes this class with the given options. @param array $options { @var bool $required whether this element is required @var string $label the display name for this element } / public function __construct array $options = array { <...> } i'm not sure this is really accepted by many tools, so i'm not sure if it makes sense to support, but it would be really cool since php coders tends to use these option arrays all over the place in libraries!
