 URL : "https://github.com/chingu-voyage3/bears-17/issues/36" TITLE : remove mongodb warnings BODY : whenever i start the dev server, i receive the following warnings: > deprecationwarning: open is deprecated in mongoose >= 4.11.0, use openuri instead, or set the usemongoclient option if using connect or createconnection . see http://mongoosejs.com/docs/connections.html use-mongo-client > db.prototype.authenticate method will no longer be available in the next major release 3.x as mongodb 3.6 will only allow auth against users in the admin db and will no longer allow multiple credentials on a socket. please authenticate using mongoclient.connect with auth credentials. we could fix it by simply adding { usemongoclient: true } to mongoose.connect .
