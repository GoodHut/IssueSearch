 URL : "https://github.com/mozilla/addons-server/issues/4868" TITLE : cannot set desktop only BODY : with webextensions we don't support versions per operating system. there is just one choice really: desktop, android or both. whilst webextensions work in both places, not all the apis do. or perhaps the add-on is only relevant to one use case. however in the status and versions page, the platform choice is a drop down. so what i want to say is it supports desktop. but i'd have to upload 3 versions of the same file and say one is for os x, one for linux and one for windows, just so i can de-select android. <img width= 721 alt= screenshot 2017-03-07 05 18 08 src= https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/74699/23658027/b8c537fa-02f5-11e7-8967-c3046f0b8a96.png > in my case i've removed the compatibility for android below, hoping that works to hide it from android users.
