 URL : "https://github.com/hozn/freezingsaddles-aurelia/issues/1" TITLE : user interface features BODY : can you please let me know if you have a feature list for this? a statement of what you want the interface to do, and mockups of what it ought to look like? i was thinking that if you have a dropbox account, you could provide any documentation you might have through a public download link. this is not urgent. take your time. thanks bob
