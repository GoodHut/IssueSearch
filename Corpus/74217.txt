 URL : "https://github.com/zakandrewking/escher/issues/205" TITLE : edit reaction ids in map BODY : it would be very nice if it was possible to change the bigg_ids directly in the map. the reason for this is that i reuse old maps to draw one for my own gem, and i find that i just have to change the ids slightly to get it correct like removing the last letter s , e.g. pp or m, to change compartment . currently i just edit the json file directly and then reload the map, but it is a bit of a hassle.
