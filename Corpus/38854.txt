 URL : "https://github.com/c0fec0de/anytree/issues/23" TITLE : rearranging the tree BODY : i'm using in one of my current projects the nodemixin class and i quite enjoy the simple way it works. i very much appreciate the work put in the module. i wonder if it would be possible to extend the package to enable defining two - or possibly more - parallel trees from the same set of nodes to account for different logics in the nodes. think: all people in the world can be ordered in a family tree on a pure biological basis but also like real parents - who grew who up. not necessarily the best example but i hope you get the point. current implementation uses the parent attribute as a keyword to define the parent-child relations. would it be possible to change this to a configurable keyword and - naive thinking, without really knowing and/or having studied the inner workings of the module - use mostly getattr-setattr to do the job?
