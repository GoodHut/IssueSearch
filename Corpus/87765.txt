 URL : "https://github.com/calcinai/xero-php/issues/233" TITLE : making payment on invoice BODY : i am using the xero laravel wrapper https://github.com/amochohan/xerolaravel and want to record payments made against an invoice. i can get the invoice but cannot find how to record a payment using the laravel wrapper provided; i have tried a couple of solutions but none seem to work; // load the invoice working $invoice = xeroprivate::loadbyguid 'accounting\\invoice', 'rpt445-1' ; $payment = \app::make 'xeropayment' ; $payment->setinvoice $invoice ; $payment->setdate carbon::now ; $payment->setamount 100 ; $xero->save $payment ; the above returns the issue > class xeropayment does not exist i can find the xero documentation but this doesn't help to how it could translate into laravel. it may be that the wrapper doesn't have this functionality built in, if so how would i complete using https://github.com/calcinai/xero-php which the wrapper is based on?
