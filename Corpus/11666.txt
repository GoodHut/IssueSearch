 URL : "https://github.com/jeffchan/truncate.js/issues/40" TITLE : ios truncate bug BODY : hi there, lately i'm running in some issues on the safari ios browser. on desktop the truncate function works great. i've set the truncate options to truncate the text at 7 lines, but on my iphone the text is truncated at about 2 / 2,5 lines. at first i thought it might be a googlefont load issue, but when trying it with default fonts like arial of using @font-face to include the font i still had the same issue. any ideas what might cause this or is there a fix for this issue? love the plugin btw, it's awesome!! thanks, randy
