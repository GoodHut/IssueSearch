 URL : "https://github.com/phetsims/tasks/issues/900" TITLE : standardized unit tests BODY : in https://github.com/phetsims/axon/issues/156 issuecomment-339147946 and https://github.com/phetsims/axon/issues/153 issuecomment-339158399, i had some unit tests that i wanted to add. but the axon unit tests didn't look like what i was expecting. so in both cases i punted by saying something like: > the above tests should be added to axon units tests but i was unsure how to add them. in https://github.com/phetsims/axon/issues/156 issuecomment-340488450, @samreid said: > i should point out that axon is using a bit older version of qunit. we opted for the new one in query-string-machine and the test apis are a bit different newer one is preferable . i replied: > thanks - i think that's what concerned me when i started looking at axon unit tests. i did add tests to query-string-machine, and axon didn't match what i was expecting. perhaps we should update all unit tests to use the same pattern? is this something the qa might be interested in?
