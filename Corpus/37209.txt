 URL : "https://github.com/Codiad/Codiad/issues/1045" TITLE : license info request BODY : hi guys, i believe the license is mit & bsd for the editor? but just wondered if someone could give me an opinion or even advice about a closed source plugin? i don't mind contributing to the codiad where i am simply improving on your excellent ide and making those changes copyleft, but at some point i have to pay the rent . the closed source plugin if pos would be a vbscript pre-compiler check declarations etc and auto beautifier with code obfuscation and proprietary copyright notice. i'd also welcome your opinion on whether or not you feel that this is fair play etc. i accept and welcome that you may not like it, and would be open to alternate suggestions. thanks!
