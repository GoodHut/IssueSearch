in the mosquito taxonomic inventory mosquito description page, a click within the box for included species opens the box to full length, making it necessary to scroll to the top of the box if a change is made at the bottom of the box, e.g. to italicise a name you must return to the buttons at the top of the box. if the box did not open fully but could be expaned with the hash at the lower right corner, the buttons could be reached without scrolling back to the top of the box.
