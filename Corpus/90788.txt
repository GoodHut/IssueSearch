 URL : "https://github.com/tilezen/vector-datasource/issues/1199" TITLE : stop using tags-> in yaml BODY : since we moved to the hstore schema, everything is in the tags column and the tags-> prefix is unnecessary. we've got a mix of different uses in the yaml files, but it could be confusing for any new contributors whether tags-> is required or not just to be clear: it's not . this should just be a sed 's/tags->//' on the yaml files, but it's possible that it might throw up some unexpected regressions.
