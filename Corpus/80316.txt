 URL : "https://github.com/poralix/directadmin-teach-sa/issues/7" TITLE : tighten file permissions BODY : since issue 3 has been closed it is now possible to set similar file permissions as other scripts without breaking the plugin. after git clone https://github.com/poralix/directadmin-teach-sa.git the following folder/file permissions are set by default: drwxr-xr-x -rwxr-xr-x i ran chmod -r 700 directadmin-teach-sa/ and tested the script. these permissions also function fine now: drwx------ -rwx------ updating the permissions of the files/folder in the repository seems the best option to me, but adding the chmod to the manual is also possible. furthermore: i've set chown -r diradmin:diradmin directadmin-teach-sa/ to change the owner from my root user to diradmin. this way directadmin has access to the script if functionality that requires this is ever added. cron_sa_learn.log is of course created as root when the script is ran the first time, but the owner remains diradmin if it is changed once. adding a dummy cron_sa_learn.log circumvents this issue.
