 URL : "https://github.com/coreos/tectonic-forum/issues/115" TITLE : reboot loop with ipxe BODY : tectonic version latested environment vmware with bare metal config expected behavior ipxe installs operation system. actual behavior i am following the bare metal documentation to setup a tectonic cluster with 3 worker nodes. i have the provisioner running and went through the graphical installer to register the controller and all workers. then i tried to boot the controller and first it looked okay for me, but i end up in a reboot loop, because it does not seem to install the operation system. see the screenshot of my last log messages, just a second before it reboots. ! untitled https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1236435/25808627/f9ded0fc-340a-11e7-9e30-13b3386d4241.png
