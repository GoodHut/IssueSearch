 URL : "https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/issues/627" TITLE : clientinitial is special BODY : the motivation for this issue is: what happens if you receive a servercleartext packet that contains sh but doesn't contain the acknowledgement for ci? should you eventually retransmit ci? this doesn't make sense, but the protocol suggests you should. we could just make it an exception, but i think we might want to go bigger. specifically, i propose we take the data in clientinitial out of stream 0 and make it special data. it is anyway because it can't be fragmented, has to be padded, etc. then the client's second flight would go in stream 0 at offset 0.
