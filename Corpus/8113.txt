 URL : "https://github.com/r-spacex/mission-control/issues/33" TITLE : move to postcss BODY : many of the mixins i'm using are easily replicable in postcss, and are much cleaner. a perfect example of this is border , which i've created a mixin to allow border-radius at the end. in postcss, i've previously created a plugin that mimics this exact functionality, except it's entirely transparent you're not explicitly calling a mixin . this is the same for other mixins i'm using, such as size , though the syntax does differ slightly. i will fully document the functionality provided by postcss when the move is made. naturally, any valid vanilla css will remain valid â”€ it's just that more will be possible with fewer lines.
