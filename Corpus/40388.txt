 URL : "https://github.com/coinbase/gdax-node/issues/142" TITLE : tx hash through api? BODY : is it possible to get the txhash of a deposit, or txhash of a withdrawal, through the deposit and withdrawal history point of the api? this information is available on my gdax account page but not through the api? that is sour transaction hash is different from deposit address. it is very very important and standard, frankly that both are included.
