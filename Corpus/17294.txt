BODY : i just thought to myself i wonder how the sierpinski triangle demo would do in elm and was searching for the react one, and this came up! this is awesome - thank you so much for making it! would it be okay with you if i shared it? i infer from commit frequency that it's currently under active development. ðŸ˜„
