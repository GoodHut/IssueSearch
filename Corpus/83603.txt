 URL : "https://github.com/hyperapp/hyperapp/issues/91" TITLE : change update to reducers BODY : i used update because that's how elm calls it, but now that i am in the process of documenting hyperapp more thoroughly, i find myself explaining that update is an object composed of reducers, which begs the question, why then not just call it _reducers_?
