 URL : "https://github.com/tbruyelle/RxPermissions/issues/188" TITLE : possible bug report BODY : hi, i would like to point to the following situation. if the developer creates a field for rxpermissions like private val rxpermissions = rxpermission this it seems to commit the fragment before the calling of oncreate and setcontentview and this causes the app to crash with a null pointer if the user open the activity, grant some permission, minimize the app, go to app settings remove the permission and come back to the app using recent used apps. one way to avoid this would be to commit the fragment only when the first subscription happens.
