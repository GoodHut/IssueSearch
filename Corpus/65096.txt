 URL : "https://github.com/donejs/bitcentive/issues/232" TITLE : implement db migrations BODY : allow for automatic running of scripts for both up and down migrations. as a matter of convention, i think we should follow a strategy used by sequelize cli where migration files are stored in the file system with a sortable name. each migration is run in order, and the db stores a list of executed migrations so that they are only run once per db instance.
