 URL : "https://github.com/aryelgois/Medools/issues/1" TITLE : config file helper BODY : a helper script which sniffs vendor packages looking for config/medools.php this script would try to merge them and show conflicts to the developer, so it can choose which one to pick. after that, the script would output the config file into root/config/medools.php - it can be a composer post-install / post-update , or a bin script - a bin script might be better, just in case it fails or is canceled
