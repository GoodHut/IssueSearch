 URL : "https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/908" TITLE : render blocking scripts BODY : hey, i am just trying to improve on what i already have going for my site. when i run my site, getivan.com, through pingdom, as well as google pagespeed insights, i get the following errors: --- eliminate render-blocking javascript and css in above-the-fold content your page has 2 blocking script resources and 1 blocking css resources. this causes a delay in rendering your page. none of the above-the-fold content on your page could be rendered without waiting for the following resources to load. try to defer or asynchronously load blocking resources, or inline the critical portions of those resources directly in the html. remove render-blocking javascript: https://getivan.com/…38f7cc330b61a7dff9dac-compressor-part.js https://getivan.com/…b16b61ffb0ef75818f584-compressor-part.js optimize css delivery of the following: https://getivan.com/…5ccccc21d12d9025d9c7-compressor-part.css --- those urls are for cometcache properties. for some reason, i can't paste the whole string. here is a link to the report: https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3a%2f%2fgetivan.com%2f&tab=mobile not sure if anything could be done about this. i would prefer it if cometcache could simply release an update, but i'm assuming that folks are either aware of this issue, and it's unavoidable, or i've misconfigured something. thanks! ivan -
