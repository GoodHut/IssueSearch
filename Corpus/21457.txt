 URL : "https://github.com/gbif/portal16/issues/483" TITLE : final menu tweak s BODY : content on the publishing quick guide https://demo.gbif.org/publishing-guide has been updated. it currently appears in the menus as the destination for 'share > publishing guide' 3rd item in the menu . however, i would like to propose that the menu slot the link to this page into the first position, slightly changing the label to 'publishing data'. this is more verb-oriented, an active statementâ€”rather than the stationary noun implied by both 'data publishing' and 'publishing guide'. once this change is made, the third item presently on the share menu 'publishing guide' can simply be removed.
