 URL : "https://github.com/lumc-python/day2-stevenhes/issues/1" TITLE : stuck on file input BODY : i have to admit that i'm completely stuck before i even started to complete the task. the script for gc percentage works fine for a file, but i think to todays pace was to high for me personally to fully understand how to piece the arguments together. i spend quite a lot of time getting it to work but to no effect. trying to def the kmer function to take a file as input i get an error that i provide to few arguments. hopefully, tomorrows discussion can still help me understand where i went wrong. i will see what other parts of the assigment, i can still code without mock input. as i none the less enjoy the overall experience. .
