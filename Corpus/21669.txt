 URL : "https://github.com/BigChief45/Peak/issues/1" TITLE : game rounds system BODY : with the current state of the game, only one round per peak game can be played. this should be changed so that a game round system is implemented. this means that: - all peak games can have a different amount of rounds to be played - implementation should be done at a parent level. - positive and negative score should be carried along each round.
