 URL : "https://github.com/Kagami/ffmpeg.js/issues/36" TITLE : string file support? BODY : ffmpeg can work with a bunch of string type files i.e. concat files, subtitles etc. but this doesn't seem to be supported? i tried hacking the method __ffmpegjs_tou8 in pre.js to not string files to uint8array but not getting any luck. basically i'm trying to run the following command to add subtitles to a mp4 file, but i'm getting invalid data found when processing input arguments: -i , input.mp4 , -c , copy , -c:s , english_subs.srt , output.mp4 , i'll try hacking away so more but thought i'd ask in case there's something i'm missing.
