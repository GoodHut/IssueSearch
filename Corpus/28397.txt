 URL : "https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/1907" TITLE : g_dbgp doesn't work BODY : hi, i'm trying to use the g_dbgp module gadget driver to debug chromebook firmware, and it doesn't work. the module loads without problem, and /dev/ttygs0 gets created but there is no output. using the module with a beaglebone black works without problem and i can see output from the firmware on boot, so i know the ehci debug port on the chromebook side of things is configured and working correctly. i enabled the module by enabling ehci debug in menuconfig under rpi-source, then running: make modules_prepare make m=drivers/usb/gadget, for f in $ find drivers/usb/gadget/ -name .ko ; do sudo cp $f /lib/modules/$ uname -r /kernel/drivers/usb/gadget/ ; done depmod -a modprobe g_dbgp with no other gadget modules loaded . can you help me to get some debug output and get to the bottom of why it's not working? thanks.
