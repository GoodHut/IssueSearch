 URL : "https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-browser/issues/676" TITLE : browser very very slow BODY : hi, i am using latest version of neo4j on windows 7 using firefox as browser. i noticed for some time also in earlyer versions that the browser becomes very very very slow in response to typing in queries .. actually it seems to start behaving like that when syntax checking was introduced some time ago.. so is there a way to bypass this syntaxt directed edting / checking ? maybe some parameters i can set ? other cause ? thanks koen
