 URL : "https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/24836" TITLE : utilities !important rule BODY : is it really necessary to use !important rule for utilities? you know, !important is not recommended. we don't use utilities necessarily for overriding other properties. in most cases, we just want apply some styles without writing css. other frameworks like uikit does not use !important for utilities: https://getuikit.com/docs/utility if you have overriding in mind, maybe bootstrap can remove all the !important from utilities and add a new class for each of them with !important rule. something like: .p-5 { padding: 5rem; } .p-i-5 { padding: 5rem !important; }
