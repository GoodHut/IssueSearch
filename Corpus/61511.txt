 URL : "https://github.com/josephschmitt/alexa-couchpotato/issues/27" TITLE : babel src -d dist issue BODY : i'm trying to manually install the devdependencies and dependencies then run the scripts via cmd as administrator and it's saying no such node, operation, or program exists, even when i try executing it from the node_modules/.bin/ folder. i've hit a few roadblocks at this point, so i'm hoping someone who has gotten there's zipped and deployed to a aws lambda function would be generous enough to upload their working .zip file with the dependencies in the project removed of the .env so i can just add my own .env and upload it too. thanks!
