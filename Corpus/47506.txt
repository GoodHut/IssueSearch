 URL : "https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/issues/249" TITLE : platform unique names BODY : in the spec we have this must be globally unique within a platform marketplace for service name. its odd to place this requirement on the broker when, in theory, it has no idea what other services are available in the platform's marketplace. i think it would be better to make this a sort of requirement on the platform - something like: this must be unique across all services objects returned in this response. platforms will typically use this value as an input parameter from their users to indicate which service they want to instantiate. to ensure the value is unique across all services from all brokers in their marketplace, platforms might need to modify these values before presenting them to their users to ensure there are not conflicts. this specification places no requirements on how platforms use this value. wanted to hear what people thought before i opened a pr for this.
