 URL : "https://github.com/Uptwinkles/twink/issues/6" TITLE : build on hubot? BODY : hubot https://hubot.github.com/ is a framework for building bots which comes with a lot of advantages. it supports plugins and adapters so we could easily extend twink with existing plugins as well as release any custom stuff as plugins. there is already a matrix adapter https://github.com/davidar/hubot-matrix/ and a scheduler https://github.com/matsukaz/hubot-schedule which uses node-schedule underneath it. some concerns: it seems to require redis to function. that's not currently a requirement, so this seems like overkill. why does it need this? if there's a good reason maybe we'll go this route. the scheduler has you input the schedules into a shell... how does this work? does this get checked into the codebase or not? i'd like some way to save this without having to dump a db periodically; i was thinking something along the lines of a data.json file.
