 URL : "https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/6018" TITLE : apk expansion support BODY : on google play, android apks are limited to 100mb. if an application has to be bigger, one has to implement a support for side loading apk expansions obb files : https://developer.android.com/google/play/expansion-files.html an obb file a zip archive with the same internal structure as the apk and has to be located in a specific system folder. i recently had to support this for loading assets through the content pipeline. thanks to the help of @dellis1972 i ended up simply modifying the titlecontainer : https://github.com/mrhelmut/monogame/commit/29f96cc6ef76ac9cab2c8687c07883ec1335a58f would it be worth to upstream this change? is there any better way to handle this? @konajugames ?
