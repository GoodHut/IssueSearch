BODY : sorry to bother you with this... i'm wondering how sf is determining which version of geos to use, i'd like to use 3.6.1 so i can work with the sf_voronoi function and i'm getting a warning about the version needing to be 3.5. i have updated geos on my system in two places to be 3.6.1 and i was able to successfully force rgeos to use the updated version with bash sudo r cmd install rgeos_0.3-23.tar.gz --configure-args='--with-geos-config=/library/frameworks/geos.framework/unix/bin/geos-config' but i can't seem to find a way to do this for sf . i updated my $path to point to gdal 2.1.3 and the geos 3.6.1 and re-installed sf but i still get the notice when i load sf -- linking to geos 3.4.2, gdal 2.1.2, proj.4 4.9.1 . i'm not sure where sf is finding geos. the version of gdal it's using seems to be in /library/frameworks/gdal.framework/versions/2.1 but when i do ./gdal-config --dep-libs i see nothing. any guidance?
