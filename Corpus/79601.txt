 URL : "https://github.com/andmarti1424/sc-im/issues/131" TITLE : some basic use questions BODY : just let me know if this is not the right /best place for such questions: 1 how to get to top of help file :h ? like in vim one would use gg . 2 how to get a file to autocalc when loaded. or how to autocalc after loading. 3 how where to preserve ':set' options? 4 the syntax for :fsum is seems to be ':int fsum'. but the help file implies ':fsum'. 5 if one selects, yanks then pastes a formula from column a to column b the references are not changed. a0+a1 does not become b0+b1 . 6 a loaded file cannot be saved without reentering its path and file name.
