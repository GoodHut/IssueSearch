 URL : "https://github.com/wbolster/temporenc/issues/5" TITLE : terminology - time-zone BODY : in jsr-310 the java 8 date and time library , we distinguish between zone offset and time zone zone offset - the number of hours, minutes and seconds from gmt, eg +02:00 time zone - the rules defining how the offset changes over time, eg. europe/paris given that temporenc uses offsets, not zones with rules, could the spec be changed to define and use the term zone offset to avoid confusion?
