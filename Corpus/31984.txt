 URL : "https://github.com/michelson/dante2/issues/70" TITLE : the futur of dante2 BODY : hi, first of all, i want to thank you for this project, i think it's probably the best medium-like editor with draftjs. in the other hand, the project seems not really active and i wanted to know if you have plans to upgrade dante2 to react 16 and the last version of draftjs a lot of depreciations need to be updated for that . thanks in advance !
