 URL : "https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/issues/2760" TITLE : make tag edition faster BODY : when adding tags to an existing articles, i need to click that add tag button for each tag. i use tags extensively, and i would like to add multiple tags at once. this is a bit like the wallabager chrome plugin is doing, which is to allow tags to be seperated by spaces or commas, or whatever and just type them all in one shot.
