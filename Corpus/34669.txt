 URL : "https://github.com/violet-php/streaming-json-encoder/issues/1" TITLE : complex json output? BODY : not an issue, but a request for an example. before i start testing with it, is it possible for your json stream library to create more complex objects? for example, i have a generator which will give arrays to output, but they go in a subsection of the response json: { @count : 37, @data : { id : 1, name : bob }, ...more items } my generator only creates the items which go under @data . can you give an example of how this could be done? or is it as easy as just passing in another buffer encoder as a value to the top level encoder? i'll probably play with this later today. if you have time to answer, that would help a lot.
