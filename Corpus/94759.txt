 URL : "https://github.com/juanpablo-santos/stripes-spring-boot/issues/3" TITLE : clean property description BODY : i can see stripeproperties is taken care by the annotation processor so that ide inspection works for stripe. properties. that's good but the description would need some love. could you please replace value for: {@code foobar.class} by something more sensible? your readme provides some description for certain keys, why not put that there? also as described in the documentation http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/ configuration-metadata-annotation-processor field's javadoc could not contain special javadoc syntax
