 URL : "https://github.com/Seravo/seravo-plugin/issues/76" TITLE : enforce strong passwords BODY : the user profile editor includes a javascript-powered password strength indicator. however, there is nothing currently built into wordpress core to prevent users from entering weak passwords. as everything else is pretty strong, week passwords is something we should tackle next. we should force _all_ users to pick strong passwords and also scan the existing user database that there are no too easy passwords e.g. we should be able to detect if there is a admin/admin or vagrant/vagrant user . i didn't find a simple build-in wordpress hook related to this, but we could look in the code of some existing plugins related to the subject: https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-password-policy-manager/trunk?rev=1456756 and https://github.com/boogah/force-strong-passwords
