 URL : "https://github.com/wpninjas/ninja-forms/issues/2737" TITLE : builder data optimisation BODY : we send too much data when saving/publishing a form. - data whitelisting - only send data that we actually need that has been modified. - don't send defaults. we localise field-type defaults and these are added to the field model in js when a field is added. because this data comes from php, there's no reason to pass along default data.
