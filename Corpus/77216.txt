 URL : "https://github.com/eddelbuettel/linl/issues/2" TITLE : more minimal yaml header BODY : persoanlly speaking, i really like the yaml to be minimal. there seem to be no way to augment the yaml data before rmarkdown::render is called, so the best we can is to make the template.tex richer. things we could do: - default font size as 10pt in latex is not pretty ; my suggestion would be 11pt - default font choice, eg hardwire mathpazo - default geometry margin 1in seems fine - anything else? i would be awesome to add per-user defaults ie user bob always want his bob_signature.pdf but that does not seem possible. thoughs, @aaronwolen ? this can of course also wait past the initial 0.0.1 release...
