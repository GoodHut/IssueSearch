 URL : "https://github.com/andrewculver/koudoku/issues/186" TITLE : undefined method can?' BODY : i'm not using cancan in my app, but in koudoku/subscriptions_controller, execution is passing into the if defined? :can? block and throwing an undefined method error. i'm on ruby 2.2.3 and rails 5.0.0. here's what i get in pry: 1 pry main > defined? :can? => expression which is actually what i get for any symbol: 2 pry main > defined? :aslckjasdclkj => expression i think the condition needs to be if defined? :can? == method or if respond_to? :can? i'm currently working around this by targeting the previous commit in my gemfile.
