BODY : hi all, relatively new to so. has anyone written any form of syntax list or cheat sheet/noddy guide for elsa at all? i'm able to drill down through data relatively easy, but looking at using the query field for more in depth analysis, with a view to having a list of frequent queries written in python to make things quicker for the analysts. thanks in advance gaz
