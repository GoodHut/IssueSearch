 URL : "https://github.com/Cardinal90/multi-cursor-case-preserve/issues/1" TITLE : no work in 1.0.1 version BODY : thank you for providing this cool stuff to help replace string easily. i found it worked when i first install on version 1.0.0, the version now is 1.0.1 but i found it doesn't work like before. i saw the change log for 1.0.1 now it doesn't changing anything, if case was equal in the first place - prevents some annoying false positives. , however, i am not clear what it changes about. how do i make it work?
