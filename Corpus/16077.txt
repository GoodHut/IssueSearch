this space is where you will be able to adjust heupr's settings on how you would like your new issues to be handled. i am programmed to _automatically_ triage newly raised issues to the appropriate developer based on their _subject matter expertise_. for example, if you'd like me to triage all outstanding open issues raised since january 2017, i can do that in a jiffy - just let me know! i'll also place a triaged label on each issue i assign if you have one provided already on your repository. please take a moment to review and edit your config settings. changes to settings need to be made directly in this issue body. configuration settings
