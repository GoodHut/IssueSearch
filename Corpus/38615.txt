 URL : "https://github.com/vue-bulma/cleave/issues/10" TITLE : problem with v-model BODY : i thought this issue had been closed, but cleave no longer works when using v-model. i'm using vue@^2.3.3 and vue-cleave@^1.2.0. here is the typical cleave component. when adding the v-model field, the cleave formatting no longer works and without the v-model field, it does. <cleave v-model= date placeholder= delivery date :options= { date: true, datepattern: 'm', 'd', 'y' } ></cleave>
