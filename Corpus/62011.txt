 URL : "https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/5535" TITLE : can't enable debug mode BODY : description of your problem spyder won't start in debug mode anymore. several weeks ago this was working. it's broken now for a couple of weeks. don't know the exact time when that changed. this affects branches 3.x as well as master. what steps will reproduce the problem? 1. run bootstrap.py --debug what is the expected output? what do you see instead? expected: spyder should start up. instead: the program terminates with the message error: can't enable debug mode - spyder is already imported please provide any additional information below debug mode will only be started if not spyder.config.base in sys.modules . however it seems that from spyder.utils.vcs import get_git_revision some lines earlier in bootstrap.py does always add this module to sys.modules . i propose to move the code for enabling debugging up before the version information. version and main components spyder version: 4.0.0.dev0 42175ba python version: 3.6.3 qt versions: 5.6.2, pyqt5 5.6 on windows dependencies pyflakes >=0.6.0 : 1.6.0 ok pycodestyle >=2.3: 2.3.1 ok pygments >=2.0 : 2.2.0 ok pandas >=0.13.1 : 0.20.3 ok numpy >=1.7 : 1.13.3 ok sphinx >=0.6.6 : 1.6.3 ok rope >=0.9.4 : 0.10.5 ok jedi >=0.9.0 : 0.10.2 ok nbconvert >=4.0 : 5.3.1 ok sympy >=0.7.3 : 1.1.1 ok cython >=0.21 : 0.26.1 ok qtconsole >=4.2.0: 4.3.1 ok ipython >=4.0 : 6.1.0 ok pylint >=0.25 : 1.7.4 ok
