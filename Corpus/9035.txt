 URL : "https://github.com/kean/Nuke-Alamofire-Plugin/issues/10" TITLE : swift 4 support BODY : is it true that the lastes released version 2.0 of this plugin has full support for swift 4? i tried to convert my cocoapods installation of this plugin to swift 4 which resulted in no change needed. if that is the case, a note in the readme would be helpful. thanks!
