 URL : "https://github.com/timomer/HAPP/issues/50" TITLE : basal profile issues BODY : i've seen some strangeness in the behaviour of the app re basal profile. sometimes i open the app, and it hasn't run the open aps part for some time, and the default basal shows 0.0u/hr. trying to manually force the aps by pressing run aps the system says it couldn't run as some profile info is missing. when i check my basal profile, all the data is gone. strangely this seems to solve itself eventually. i wonder if you may also have and this may be related 12-24 hr issues in the basal profile entry. it seems i can only enter 12 values - i can't get beyond 12pm to 23:59 . if i try to enter 13:00-13:59 it overwrites the 00:00-00:59 value at the top of the list... the reason it may be related is when i was setting up the profile the first time i hadn't realised it was over writing, saved the profile, but the aps wouldn't run as it said profile info was missing. hope that's useful!
