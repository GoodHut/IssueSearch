 URL : "https://github.com/billerickson/display-posts-shortcode/issues/147" TITLE : regarding issue 146 BODY : hello again - i couldn't figure out how to re-open 146 , but please see the additional comments i provided to your suggestion: https://github.com/billerickson/display-posts-shortcode/issues/146 my confusion lies in the outer vs. inner part of the output - i'm referring to the 'title' that's on the outer part, namely on lines 535..550 of the plugin, which i believe is outside the scope of the 'display_posts_shortcode_output' filter you are suggesting. thanks so much for your help and your excellent plugin.
