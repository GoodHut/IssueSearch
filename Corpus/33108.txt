 URL : "https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/2571" TITLE : abuse of unreachable BODY : unreachable was added to help compiler determine that a branch can not be reached. unfortunately, unreachable in release builds is a noop, and it's being used in all cases when the programmer thinks that a branch is unreachable, not when it really is. unreachable should lead to panic in production.
