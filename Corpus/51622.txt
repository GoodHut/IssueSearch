 URL : "https://github.com/justinmk/vim-dirvish/issues/99" TITLE : avoid scrolling window BODY : when switching back to a buffer e.g. with c-^ and :bn and family, etc. , vim tries to scroll whatever line the cursor was on last to the center of the window. i find this behavior extremely disorienting, so i use the code in the following link to just leave the window position exactly the way it was. http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/avoid_scrolling_when_switch_buffers this code relies on the bufenter and bufleave autocommands. however, it seems that opening dirvish does not invoke these autocommands. as a test, open dirvish and immediately close it with q . observe how vim will still try to scroll the window so the cursor line is in the center of the window. thanks for your help, and for creating this awesome plugin!
