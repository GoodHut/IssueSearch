 URL : "https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/issues/67" TITLE : code for sidebar w/drawer? BODY : stupid question, but i'm trying to figure out how to embed a sidebar with drawer functionality as in the examples. https://vuetifyjs.com/components/sidebar however, the source code on the page doesn't seem to mirror the actual, working examples. essentially, what i want is a navbar with the hamburger icon to open/close the sidebar. that's it. is it possible to include the source code for your working examples as opposed to the just minimum code needed for each example ? hope this makes sense.
