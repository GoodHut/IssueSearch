 URL : "https://github.com/jackd248/temps/issues/33" TITLE : startup at login issues BODY : i downloaded the linux x64 zip and i've had a couple issues. 1. unchecking the start at login box in the settings and hitting apply doesn't stay applied after exiting the app or logging out and back in. this relates to my next issue: 2. the startup script that app makes doesn't work. the script is /path/to/app/temps.app --hidden the problem is that a the executable is called temps , the .app is a macos naming convention, is it not? and b the --hidden option doesn't actually seem to do anything. i assume it's supposed to silently open the app in the system tray, which would be handy, but instead it opens the applet window regardless. so now i've made a second startup script which is just /path/to/app/temps since the other script that gets generated every time the app opens doesn't work. all that said, cool app, i look forward to seeing it improve :
