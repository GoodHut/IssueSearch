 URL : "https://github.com/blockstack/designs/issues/537" TITLE : keynote/pdf design plan BODY : keynote/pdf design plan - think of laying out the document as if it was indesign but you're in keynote. so it will be page layout looking but keep in mind all the keynote limitations so let's not design it to much like a page layout program or it will end up a mess. - guy will provide access to the identity, storage, tokens code illustration that appears on the blocktack.org home page. - make icons as isomorphic as possible and more importantly as consistent in design as possible
