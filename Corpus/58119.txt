 URL : "https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/2067" TITLE : safe memset for slices BODY : rfc 1419 https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1419 implemented safe memcpy but not memset . it would be awesome if we could fill slices with data in a safe manner that would lower into memset . currently if i want to fill a slice i have to do this: rust unsafe { ptr::write_bytes self.slice.as_mut_ptr , 0, self.slice.len - 1 ; } i would like to be able to do something like this: rust self.slice.fill 0 ;
