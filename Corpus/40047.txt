 URL : "https://github.com/ServUO/ServUO/issues/1484" TITLE : tailoring & leggings BODY : got a message from one of my players today that said the following: got a likely glitch with tailoring. most every time i craft exceptional leggings, i get a message that i mark it and place it in my bag, but no leggings appear. repeatable with gargish cloth leggings and i just had the same thing happen with bone leggings. using the latest svn i believe we are patched up all the way to rev 1628. figured i'd pass it along if it is an actual bug that can be reproduced. reported by: nadious report thread: http://servuo.com/threads/tailoring-leggings.6341/
