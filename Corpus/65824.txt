 URL : "https://github.com/space10-community/conversational-form/issues/148" TITLE : limiting select options BODY : hi - if i want to limit the number of options in a multi select field, should i observe the select element like i was validating a normal form or is there another way i should do this using cf- tags? essentially i want the visitor to be able to select a maximum of two options on a question, and for the response to be sent on the second selection like they'd hit return . the conversational form works really well with the multi-select field, i just want to tweak the behaviour!
