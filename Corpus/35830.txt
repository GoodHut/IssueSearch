 URL : "https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/4220" TITLE : file creation events BODY : i would like to know more about how events are distributed around che, and how it goes from workspace to ide and the other way around. for example i would like to have notification in ide when some file is created. so, when file.txt is created, at some path, event is sent to the ide. and on ide side i have access to path of that file. which event would that be? and how it should be implemented on both sides, server and client. what i would like is to have something similar to projectlisteners.java at plugin-java plugin https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/plugins/plugin-java/che-plugin-java-ext-lang-server/src/main/java/org/eclipse/che/plugin/java/server/projectlisteners.java so when some file is created, the event is sent. i've tried some things, but it hasn't worked for me, so i would like if someone could explain to me a bit more thorough. i also seen similar things answered, but it wasn't exactly the solution, and i couldn't make it work. i would also like to know if it's possible to run _commands_ from server side of the application?
