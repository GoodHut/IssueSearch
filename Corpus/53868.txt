 URL : "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/2294" TITLE : expire url media cache BODY : the images that are downloaded for url previews table local_media_repository_url_cache are never deleted from the media store. as far as i've heard, they are not even used anymore if the last preview was more than an hour ago. in my case, this is about 8000 files and 1 gb of data after about 9 months of synapse usage, and i'm the only user on my hs that ever saw any url previews the others use mobile clients only . this is nearly half the size of regular remote_content, so it's really a considerable amount of uselessly wasted disk space. please delete old images from url previews regularly.
