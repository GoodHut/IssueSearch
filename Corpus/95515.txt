 URL : "https://github.com/sandeepmistry/noble/issues/647" TITLE : dealing with large packets BODY : hi, i'm new to ble, but i got the impression that noble and bleno would automatically handle packets larger than the mtu by splitting them up; however, when i write something more than 512b, the peripheral will not receive anything and the central does not find any errors. could you help me figure out what's going on? thanks.
