 URL : "https://github.com/Ericsson/codechecker/issues/528" TITLE : binary packaging ideas BODY : some options to consider if we want to create a binary package. - pypi https://pypi.python.org/pypi and virtualenv: linux, windows, mac install with pip in python, all the python dependencies would be downloaded and installed, but there are still missing dependencies which the user needs to install manually clang, clang-tidy, postgresql ... - appimage http://appimage.org/ : rhel, centos, ubuntu, fedora, debian create a universal binary package in an old enough linux release, custom compile scripts are needed to build dependencies clang, clang-tidy, psycopg, ldap, psutil ... no extra installation is required by the user - docker image https://www.docker.com/ : mac, windows, linux more heavyweight than the previous options and docker is needed to be installed which is might not possible for some older releases. i still think pypi package should be created, this would enable easier installation in the other cases too. appimage seems promising but this is a linux only option. what do you think? do you know other options we should consider?
