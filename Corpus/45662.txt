 URL : "https://github.com/Moe-Team/MysteryOnline/issues/2" TITLE : improve visual design BODY : as of now mo uses kivy's default theme for buttons, labels, and pretty much everything else. it would be neat to have our own theme for those things. so i propose this plan, feel free to comment what to add to it. - make our own button theme - improve the design of the inventory - improve the toolbar's design maybe move some of its elements somewhere else - improve the right click's menu design
