 URL : "https://github.com/Antergos/Cnchi/issues/716" TITLE : cnchi partitioning bugs BODY : problem: my first antergos installation, i installed pure arch just a couple of days ago so this might be just me. everything goes well until the partitioning part, i create a new efi partition and fill it screenshot 1 , apply, but the result shows fat instead of fat32 screenshot 2 . next, i try to add the root partition screenshot 3 , this time the type is applied properly but the label is lost screenshot 4 it does get fixed however once i re-edit the entry again. next, the boot partition. i fill it screenshot 5 , this time the type is changed from ext4 to fat kind of like the efi and the label is lost again screenshot 6 . when i try to change the entry, the type shows as ext4 not fat like it was showing so it might be a graphical bug. the label however, is not back screenshot 7 , the editing fixes it too though. swap worked perfectly. the final result screenshot 8 shows no mountpoint bugs they never needed editing , no label bugs root and boot were edited on the process , and two type bugs efi and boot . what's weird again is coming back to the type bugs and editing them shows the type as swap not fat screenshot 9 , clicking apply changes the type and mountpoint into swap and changing in it back to efi and mountpoint /boot/efi gives the same result i got when initially setting efi but editing it again shows fat32 and not just fat like on all the partitions list. and editing the boot partition that also has fat type into ext4 changes the efi type into ext4 too on the edit part not on the all partitions list part . i'm pretty sure editing this more will show new variations but i just want to go ahead and try installing, maybe it's all graphical. log files cnchi.log: https://paste2.org/k0yw9c7e pacman-boot.log https://paste2.org/mc12xhc1 postinstall.log: will add after install.
