 URL : "https://github.com/monochromegane/the_platinum_searcher/issues/186" TITLE : searching from git root BODY : pt is great. i'd like to have it search from the git root, this way, whatever the current cwd . is, it would search from the top of the tree. or, even better, a marker like the .pt.config file. perhaps with an added flag, it could enable that behavior ? what do you think ? i'm willing to contribute it if the design is approved.
