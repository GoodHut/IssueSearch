 URL : "https://github.com/xebialabs-community/xld-azure-app-services-plugin/issues/2" TITLE : can't connect to azure BODY : hey guys, i am having trouble making any connection to azure using the new plugin. i realize that may no be your problem : but was looking for a little help. i thought perhaps it was a firewall problem. i followed the directions here https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal and using those creds except for the ftp user i am able to connect. first does the check connection use the ftp user, and if so does it have to be in any special format? any tips, i can't seem to make headway. error i get when checking connection: error while executing script azure_app_services/check_connection.py : java.util.concurrent.executionexception: java.util.concurrent.executionexception: java.net.connectexception: connection refused: connect in <script> at line number 21 com.xebialabs.platform.script.jython.jythonexception: error while executing script azure_app_services/check_connection.py : java.util.concurrent.executionexception: java.util.concurrent.executionexception: java.net.connectexception: connection refused: connect in <script> at line number 21 thanks! bernie
