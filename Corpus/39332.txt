 URL : "https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/md380tools/issues/754" TITLE : screenshots over usb BODY : for documentation and for the website, it would be handy to take screenshots over usb. implementation suggestions by @wolf-dl4yhf follow. i know this is crazy and possibly not worth the effort, but... how about reading the lcd framebuffer via usb, and making graphic screenshots with a slightly modified md380tools python script ? the principle used in applet/src/lcd_driver.c to move a rectangular area block of pixels from the cpu into the lcd controller without having to send the coordinate for each pixel also works the other way around, i.e. from lcd controller to the cpu. the only pitfall would be that in the usb interrupt handler, we cannot safely assume that the fsmc external memory interface is really configured to access the lcd instead of polling the keyboard. this would allow taking optimal photos well, screenshots for any kind of documentation.
