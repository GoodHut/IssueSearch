 URL : "https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-android/issues/28" TITLE : hide . files BODY : basic info - i'm running cryptomator on: nexus 6p android 7.1.1. - i'm using cryptomator in version: 0.3 description when opening a google drive vault there are always ._filename.png files and the original filename.png maybe you should better hide these ._filename.png files. because they are useless for the user and can really clutter up the view of the file list. thanks :
