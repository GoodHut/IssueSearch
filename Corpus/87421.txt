 URL : "https://github.com/pgte/skiff/issues/41" TITLE : levelup events not firing BODY : playing around with skiff using memdown and i am attempting to get levelup put/del events from a 3 node skiff cluster. i have 1 node making a put request after the leader has been elected and i can see that the data is written. all 3 nodes run the same code on different ports in separate processes with the exception of node 3 calling a put after 2.5s pertinent code is js const db = skiff.levelup db.on 'put', console.log i get no console output on any of the 3 nodes. is there a way to achieve this?
