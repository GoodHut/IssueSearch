 URL : "https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/issues/478" TITLE : perl/ perl 6 operators BODY : hello, i noticed that perl have the $_ and @_ symbols, both can be accessed like this $_ 0 and @_ 0 . can we have $_, $_ , @_, @_ ligatures? i know that exists the _ for clojure. also, perl 6 has a lot of operators, https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators i think it would be nice if some of them were in ligature form, but i don't know if it is possible since a lot have letters . i'm don't know the language, so i can't help decide if they would be useful or not. thanks
