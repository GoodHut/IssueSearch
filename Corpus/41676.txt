 URL : "https://github.com/RadioSystems/Cake.Talend/issues/3" TITLE : add cake-contrib user BODY : first of all, i wanted to thank you for adding to the cake community by adding this addin. i was just wondering if you had seen this blog post: http://cakebuild.net/blog/2016/08/cake-contribution-organization we are currently going through a process of increasing the visibility of addins, and also trying to ensure their long term maintainability. to that end, we are asking addin creators to add the cake-contrib user on nuget as a co-owner this can be done through the nuget website by clicking on manage owners on the package page . would you be interested in doing this? if you have any questions about this, please let me know. there was some initial concern that the cake team were trying to take over packages, and that couldn't be further from the truth, and if you have this concern, or others, i would like to address them. thanks!
