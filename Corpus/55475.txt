 URL : "https://github.com/askmike/gekko/issues/840" TITLE : isolation of backtests BODY : hi! i'm running backtests automated, and my results shows me that when running multiple backtests with completely different strategy-parameters but the same simulationbalance and daterange , i'm getting the exact same result for every backtest? my approach is to use the rest api, and send 20 different calls in parallel. is every backtest run isolated from other backtests? do gekko support parallel backtests via the rest-api?
