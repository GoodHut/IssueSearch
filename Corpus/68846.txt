 URL : "https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/14900" TITLE : simplify promise design BODY : right now dom::promise is implemented as a struct containing some js pointers, and are careful to use rc<promise> everywhere to share these structures. the rc sharing allows us to store a permanent root inside dom::promise and allows the values to be moved around. it would be nice to change this design so that we could use root<promise> and heap<promise> like other rooted js types - presumably promise would be a newtype around mut jsobject in this case.
