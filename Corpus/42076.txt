BODY : maybe i am dense, but i cannot figure an obvious way to do something like this: http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/minecraft-java-edition/redstone-discussion-and/commands-command-blocks-and/2546347-1-12-custom-loot-tables entryempty adding an 'empty' entry into a loot table with its own weight. for example, something like: code val vblacksmith = loottables.gettable minecraft:chests/village_blacksmith ; val vblacksmithpool = vblacksmith.addpool nicestuff , 10, 10, 1, 1 ; vblacksmithpool.additementry <toughasnails:lifeblood_crystal>, 1 ; vblacksmithpool.additementry <empty>, 2 ; /code you can do something similar with conditions such as: code vblacksmithpool.additementryhelper <toughasnails:lifeblood_crystal>, 1, 1, , conditions.randomchance 0.33 ; /code but i dislike the solution especially with long tables. i assume i could add something like this: code vblacksmithpool.additementryhelper <minecraft:apple>, 2, 1, , conditions.randomchance 0.0 ; /code as an entry that will always effectively be 'empty' but that doesn't seem like it should be a good or obvious solution.. or am i just horribly missing something? if so, maybe this could be added to the documentation to make it more obvious? unless it is and i am just blind.
