 URL : "https://github.com/byuweb/byu_d8/issues/10" TITLE : fix menu active class BODY : menu active background is not showing because drupal 8 uses the active class 'is-active' not 'active' like drupal 7 and the components use. a override this theme to use 'active' b have components styling apply whether the class is 'active' or 'is-active'. a works only for our theme, not other d8 themes.
