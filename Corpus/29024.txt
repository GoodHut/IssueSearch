 URL : "https://github.com/sol/hpack/issues/225" TITLE : input glob escaping BODY : in my input-glob-escaping branch https://github.com/quasicomputational/hpack/tree/input-glob-escaping , i've attempted to test and document how to escape the globbing metacharacters, presuming that they behave posixishly. however, this doesn't work: the pattern data/foo does not match data/foo , according to the test.
