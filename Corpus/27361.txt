 URL : "https://github.com/msys2/msys2/issues/28" TITLE : crlfs not converted BODY : i have been using another msys2 distribution for some time and had this is a makefile: for f in cat some-file-with-crlf-line-endings ; do ... some-file-with-crlf-line-endings contains a series of file names, each one in separate line. it worked perfectly until recent change to this msys2 distribution in which it has stopped working. short investigation revealed that it fills f variable with cr at the end of file name. it has been corrected to: for f in cat some-file-with-crlf-line-endings | dos2unix ; do ... but i suppose more surprises like this lying around. could someone tell me please whether crlfs are translated internally or everything should be lf?
