 URL : "https://github.com/ChibiOS/ChibiOS-Contrib/issues/111" TITLE : chibios rt needed BODY : hello, i am using the hal of chibios but not the rt part because i do not need a rtos for my projet. i am using your qei driver. it works nice but i had to move some: c include ch.h after the line checking if the module is used. ex: c if hal_use_timcap == true || defined __doxygen__ the files i had to modify: - os/hal/include/hal_eeprom.h - os/hal/include/hal_timcap.h - os/hal/ports/stm32/lld/dma2dv1/hal_stm32_dma2d.c - os/hal/ports/stm32/lld/ltdcv1/hal_stm32_ltdc.c - os/hal/ports/stm32/lld/timv1/hal_timcap_lld.c so if the rt part is really needed for these components, maybe it will be possible to move the include after the check is the module is used in order to allow users to use other modules without the rt part of chibios. thanks.
