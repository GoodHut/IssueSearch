 URL : "https://github.com/skyverge/woocommerce-custom-product-tabs-lite/issues/9" TITLE : conflict with tab manager BODY : the $product global is null in the admin when hooked into woocommerce_product_tabs ; while not an issue on its own, when tab manager tries to check for third party tabs here, and cptl checks if it should add its tab or not using the product, this causes an error since the product isn't an object here. this should just have a sanity check for the product being an object when checking for whether a custom tab should be added or not. reported in : zd ticket 554435 http://woothemes.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/554435
