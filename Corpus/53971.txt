 URL : "https://github.com/frictionlessdata/specs/issues/395" TITLE : faq or rationale page? BODY : some properties have been already discussed a long time ago sometimes quite hardly . when a newcomer, as i am, is trying to understand the rationale behind each property, it's very difficult to navigate into the past debates and decisions. and i think that many questions will be asked again and again such as hey, why did you choose this contributor.role.author instead of commonly used dublin core creator ? . a faq could be a good place to explain what can't be explained in the spec. i'm ready to ask the first questions : and i think i can answer some of them.
