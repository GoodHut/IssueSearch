 URL : "https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin/issues/1180" TITLE : merge 4180 for rt-ac66u BODY : hello there! i saw at the forum the 680.65 alpha http://www.snbforums.com/threads/test-build-asuswrt-merlin-380-65-alpha-builds.36508/ that you don't have the 4180 gpl for rt-ac66u. i saw at the asus' website the link to donwload the source code. at the asus support for rt-ac66u https://www.asus.com/uk/networking/rtac66u/helpdesk_download/ , just select others and then source code . or is this router one of those: or in the case of some models, the provided gpl was missing all closed source components ? thank you!
