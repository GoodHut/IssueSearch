 URL : "https://github.com/dotJEM/json-validation/issues/4" TITLE : support for rule as. BODY : for data that can be provided e.g. as either a string or number, but which should always be treated as a number, the ability to convert the data before constraints would be nice. this is so that we can treat the two objects: { num: '42' } and { num: 42 } the same, as the first one allows for conversion to the later. while this can be done with separate rules that works on either string or numbers, if the value should be between e.g. 40 and 50, it becomes cumbersome. perhaps something like a fieldas<int> num , must.be.greaterthan 39 & be.lessthan 51
