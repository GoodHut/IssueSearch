BODY : using the kitchen sink at https://ace.c9.io/build/kitchen-sink.html, if i type if { in the autohotkey language, then press enter, it automatically indents and closes with a } on a newline this doesn't seem to happen in caret, is there a way to enable it? also, in the ahk language, if i type in the kitchen sink, it automatically closes it with another and puts the caret in between. this only seems to happen in caret for certain files like js files , is there a way to make it happen for .ahk files? finally, in the ace kitchen sink, checking the option show token info is very helpful to me and shows tooltips on the different types of tokens, is this possible to enable in caret?
