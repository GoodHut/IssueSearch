 URL : "https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-java/issues/273" TITLE : get unassigned ips BODY : sendgrid returns a list of all ip addresses on your account. it also returns a list of assigned ip addresses.
what it doesn't do is return a list of unassigned ips. please create a method that will get the ips available and return any that do not have a subuser assigned to them.
see get /ips https://sendgrid.com/docs/api_reference/api_v3.html ip-addresses for more information
