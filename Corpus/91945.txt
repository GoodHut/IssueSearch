 URL : "https://github.com/tonybaloney/tox-pipenv/issues/2" TITLE : use --dev flag in install BODY : first of all, thanks for this plugin, very handy, simplifies pipenv usage in tox a lot. due the existence of the _dev packages_ in pipfiles, i think that this plugin should use it, so the call to pipenv https://github.com/tonybaloney/tox-pipenv/blame/7408c1c84402b031047d3e25ad6f3e1f434adb7a/tox_pipenv/plugin.py l36 would be: pipenv install --dev in my case i use pytest for testing, is a develompent dependency, no a distribution one, so, when i run tox, the test environment fails because pytest isn't installed. of course, i can add pytest as dependency in tox config, but using pipenv for this is more elegant solution imho. what do you think? thanks!
