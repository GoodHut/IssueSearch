 URL : "https://github.com/SCAII/SCAII/issues/15" TITLE : cffi modules in core BODY : similar to 14 we'd like to support cffi in core, right now we can only load rust. this would be a new plugintype with cconfig, with a path, similar to rustffi. note that loading python this way is out of scope, for now if the user wants to load python this way they have to wrap it themselves. this will take a little extra api design. unlike rpc we can require the serialize methods to have some canonical signature. as a quick note, we will require a destroy or drop function from the c library to clean up, and this means we need to try and load that function first , because if we can't load that function we can't clean up.
