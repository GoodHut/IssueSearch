 URL : "https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/issues/6683" TITLE : z moves after level BODY : i am using the latest 1.1.x build downloaded a day or two ago on a modified makergear m2 printer. i have everything working for the most part except for the leveling. i am using an inductive probe attached to the x carriage. the z axis homes to min and i am using the bilinear autoleveling. it seems to home fine but then moves 2 mm away. offset won't change this. after trying to debug using the m111 s255 command it seems that the printer is sending a deploy probe command that moves it 2mm. this appears to stem from the z_clearance_between_probes variable since when i set it to zero this issue stopped. so my question is why is the deploy using this variable when i have the z_clearance_deploy_probe set to 0? i have attached config, adv config, and the log from my homing debug. configuration_adv_h.txt https://github.com/marlinfirmware/marlin/files/991411/configuration_adv_h.txt configuration_h.txt https://github.com/marlinfirmware/marlin/files/991412/configuration_h.txt homing_log.txt https://github.com/marlinfirmware/marlin/files/991413/homing_log.txt thanks. hbc
