 URL : "https://github.com/getgrav/grav/issues/1766" TITLE : taxonomy default values BODY : hi, i currently have a custom taxonomy for departments. i can display a list of all the selected departments for jobs available. however, i would like to put in departments and display them for departments which do not have any available careers. i've tried doing merge to push in a pre-existing array of the departments but this overwrites the total of jobs available.. is there a way of doing this? thanks
