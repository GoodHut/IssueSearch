 URL : "https://github.com/NCEAS/metacatui/issues/109" TITLE : feedback from sharis BODY : jesse sent this over slack and i've re-formatted and cleaned it up: - simple to upload multiple files at a time. - something that could possibly be helpful since i feel like we see a lot of too short abstracts: including in parenthesis next to where you fill in the abstract this portion from the checklist, “abstract should provide an overview of the scientific context/project, how this data set fits into a larger project, a synopsis of the experimental or sampling design and a summary of the data contents ” - i don’t understand the “keyword thesaurus” option - also don’t understand “alternate identifier”. my guess is if you have the data published somewhere else so you give the doi of that. maybe i just don’t understand because i am not a scientist - i like the bubbles that pop up when you hover over the usage rights options, i think that could be helpful for my previous confusions. - can’t tell if the locations entry still will create a box or if it is only a point. - i hit save and it gave me an error that “not all of your changes could be saved.” <?xml version= 1.0 encoding= utf-8 ?><error detailcode= 1190 errorcode= 500 name= servicefailure > <description>error inserting or updating document: urn:uuid:db97419b-c5ef-4c4a-a032-fd634f80f1d6 since &lt;?xml version= 1.0 ?&gt;&lt;error&gt;cvc-complex-type.2.4.b: the content of element 'associatedparty' is not complete. one of '{individualname, organizationname, positionname, address, phone, electronicmailaddress, onlineurl, userid, role}' is expected.&lt;/error&gt;</description> </error> - i closed the red error box and the saving icon has been swirling still for a long time - i tried resubmitting because i thought maybe it was having trouble since i made up a fake funding number and alternate identifier. so i re entered everything and just left those boxes blank and i still got the same error.”
