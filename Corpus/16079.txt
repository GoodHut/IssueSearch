BODY : sorry for misuse of pull request . i'm new here. and forgive my language, i'm russian. translate.google.com my friend i'm interested in the correct function call from snap7.dll. in particular, i'm interested in how to get data from this function? int cli_dbread s7object client, int dbnumber, int start, int size, void pusrdata ; function cli_dbread client: s7object; dbnumber, start, size: integer; pusrdata: pointer : integer; what is pusrdata? pointer to user data. that is, an array with data from db? how will this be done correctly? or here is one more function: int cli_getplcdatetime s7object client, tm datetime ; function cli_getplcdatetime client: s7object; var datetime: tcpp_tm : integer; here we get the general time in the incomprehensible structure of tcpp_tm. in general, i really want to understand all aspects of the correct call to dllcall.
