 URL : "https://github.com/ywangd/stash/issues/229" TITLE : grep x | cat doesn't work BODY : the grep command cleverly combines 1 highlighting with _stash.text_color of matches in a line, and 2 checking if a line matches the regular expression by verifying whether highlighting changed the line. however, for pipes and file output, highlighting is suppressed in _stash.text_style with always==false , so the line doesn't change, regardless whether it matches or not, and hence no matches get reported. i'll submit a fix in the dev branch.
