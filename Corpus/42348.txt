 URL : "https://github.com/laravel/passport/issues/398" TITLE : auth events not fired BODY : i'm developing a multi-tenant application that requires to catch authenticated requests to determine the context according with the logged user and to archive it i'm created a shared object across the application. we determined to use passport with password grant type as authentication strategy for spa. the problem is when a api request is made with passport the auth events https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/authentication events are not triggered. looking the sessionguard, it is done here https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/5.4/src/illuminate/auth/sessionguard.php l134 : php if ! is_null $id { if $user = $this->provider->retrievebyid $id { $this->fireauthenticatedevent $user ; } } but looking in tokenguard of passport https://github.com/laravel/passport/blob/c87deee105c3e4d7d71d578019aca00db1f1133a/src/guards/tokenguard.php l102 , these events are not triggered anytime. i think these events are basic for any application and only laravel\passport\events\accesstokencreated and laravel\passport\events\refreshtokencreated are not enough.
