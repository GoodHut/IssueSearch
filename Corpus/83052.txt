 URL : "https://github.com/DiscordDungeons/Bugs/issues/473" TITLE : bot stalled, caused death BODY : bot didn't respond to a few commands, then responded to them all at once. next adventure killed me. details: used lemons with no response. tried adventure command, still no response. used lemons again, then bot responded with all three commands. lemons were weirdly used though - seemed like the same exact action performed with the same results both times healed to 177 hp . did some sides, then tried adventure command again, but died somehow even though i had 177 hp and the beast was not strong enough to deal that much damage. may be related with 386 as it seems like the bot also didn't respond to the heal, then responded to both at once and was killed on the next adventure. screenshots: ! screenshot 2 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34378516/33776588-e24b1f56-dc0f-11e7-92df-7aba28bd8cf3.png ! screenshot 3 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34378516/33776605-eb4043d4-dc0f-11e7-93c0-e7be4cba5467.png
