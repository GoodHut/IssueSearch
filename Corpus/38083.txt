 URL : "https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/57372" TITLE : node affinity on psp BODY : <!-- this form is for bug reports and feature requests only! if you're looking for help check stack overflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/kubernetes and the troubleshooting guide https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/troubleshooting/ . --> is this a bug report or feature request? : > /kind feature what happened : there're different groups of nodes in one k8s cluster, and not all the nodes are open to every user, or open on the psp to all the nodes. e.g. one service account has privileged permission. it means that the service account can create any pod on any node, and can act as root to the os. what you expected to happen : it would be like that psp can be defined with node selector. with this definition, one pod, which has the allowed psp actions, is scheduled to the selected nodes, instead of other nodes.
