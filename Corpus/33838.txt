BODY : i am glad to inform you that the attiny 4/5/9/10 series is not eol. it seems that microchip only replaced the ordering codes. if you check the current rev 8127h, issued 11/16 data sheet pg 12, you can see that the sot23 6st1 package continues with new ordering codes. you can also search for microchips eol notification for attiny10, describing the recommended replacement with the exact new ordering codes as in the datasheet. also it seems that the new ordering codes describe exactly the same chip. it seems that no silicon revision was issued. also see pg 203 and 204. you gave me quite the scare there, as i also like this little uc a lot... :
