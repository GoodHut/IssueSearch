 URL : "https://github.com/MarcusBarnes/mik/issues/442" TITLE : failure on null mappings BODY : after a git pull, i tried running mik on a new ini file that included some null lines in the mapping file, which map to templates which is normal practice as far as i know . when i run mik checkconfig, i get the following error: error: mapping snippet null0 appears to be not well formed i tried running on older ini files that i know work, and got the same error. any ideas what's happening?
