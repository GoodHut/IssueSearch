_originally opened as https://github.com/guillermooo/vintageous/issues/344_ ---- in vi, the ex command :e replaces the current buffer with the previously-edited file. in vintageous, it erroneously begins editing a new file called . if i replace the current tab's contents with that of a different file e.g. :e ~/somefile.txt then :e should behave like vi, and go back to the previous file in the same tab. i'm uncertain about how or whether this feature should interact with other tabs.
