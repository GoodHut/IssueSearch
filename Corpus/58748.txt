 URL : "https://github.com/munificent/wren/issues/439" TITLE : strange list behaviour BODY : the following wren code on master : var activate = fn.new { var roster = boop , doop system.print roster: % roster roster.clear } when invoked from c++: c++ void wren_macro_runner::activate { wrenensureslots _wrenvm.get , 1 ; wrengetvariable _wrenvm.get , main , activate , 0 ; wrencall _wrenvm.get , wrengetslothandle _wrenvm.get , 0 ; } results in my writefn function being called with roster: system ?! also results in the errorfn being invoked with the following parameters: line: -1 module: none message: string does not implement 'clear '. and then: module: main line: 10 message: new _ block argument i can't figure out why this would be the case, i'm sure i'm likely doing something very wrong. my wren integration can be found here https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elfeesho/tgbdual/master/sdl_ui/src/scripting/wren_macro_runner.cpp
