 URL : "https://github.com/sjdirect/abot/issues/170" TITLE : number of pages to crawl BODY : hello, what is the best way to crawl a website without defining number of pages to be crawled? since i dont know, or dont have an estimate on the number of pages to be crawled, i can't define anything. how should i tell the crawler to crawl all the site? also, i don't want the crawler to go to external domain. thanks.
