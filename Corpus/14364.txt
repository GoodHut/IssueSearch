 URL : "https://github.com/Unidata/MetPy/issues/537" TITLE : add vector helper BODY : after seeing some of the complexities in implementing storm motion and shear, it seems like we need a vector container to make it simpler to group vector components. - a simple wrapper around a quantity - support unpacking like a tuple - support math operations - provide .magnitude to get vector magnitude - maybe have methods for dot and cross - methods to simplify cross product with unit vectors think k x vec - easy creation from 2 or more components with unit checking - easy access to individual components
