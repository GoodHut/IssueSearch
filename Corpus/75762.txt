 URL : "https://github.com/powerline/fonts/issues/248" TITLE : icons not working on mac BODY : i have setup on-my-zsh, iterm2 and recently i decided to install powerlevel9k theme. previously it was agnoster. so i cloned the powerlevel9k theme from github and edited the ~/.zshrc file to select it. i previously had installed powerline/fonts and they were working with agnoster. but now they aren't working. i updated oh-my-zsh and re-installed powerline/fonts. i am not a professional but i would really appreciate if somebody could walk me through this process to rectify this issue. <img width= 1440 alt= screen shot 2017-09-07 at 12 36 00 am src= https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9084333/30129738-939b9f1e-9364-11e7-9064-320e044b3d3e.png > <img width= 404 alt= screen shot 2017-09-07 at 12 39 06 am src= https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9084333/30129876-02a6d130-9365-11e7-829e-c9ead01e5c76.png >
