 URL : "https://github.com/tylercd100/lern/issues/48" TITLE : slack: as_user or icon BODY : hi, i've noticed that when an exception logs through to slack it uses the default bot icon rather than the icon i've given the bot. bit frustrating. looking at the documentation for slack it appears this is because as_user setting is false by default and then it uses a default icon. how can i add this setting to the slack notifier and/or be able to customize the icon used by emoji/url ?
