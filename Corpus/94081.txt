 URL : "https://github.com/ucb-bar/dsptools/issues/93" TITLE : blackboxfloat ln and log10 BODY : vcs is super unhappy with them not sure how you can constrain the input to be >0 b/c it keeps saying it's invalid for in < 0 ... i've been commenting them out every time i run tests, which kind of sucks. i recall @ducky64 had a pr that pulled ops out so you wouldn't be importing all of the real systemverilog ops if you only used one or two . we should consider merging asap.
