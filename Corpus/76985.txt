 URL : "https://github.com/fchollet/keras/issues/5033" TITLE : metrics are not changing BODY : when running a model with more metrics such as recall and fbeta_score the logged results are exactly the same: 59596/59596 ============================== - 3173s - loss: 0.5636 - acc: 0.6712 - fbeta_score: 0.6712 - recall: 0.6712 - val_loss: 0.5500 - val_acc: 0.6742 - val_fbeta_score: 0.6742 - val_recall: 0.6742 surely these should be different? - x check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of keras. you can update with: pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps - x if running on tensorflow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. the installation instructions can be found here https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/os_setup . - if running on theano, check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of theano. you can update with: pip install git+git://github.com/theano/theano.git --upgrade --no-deps - provide a link to a github gist of a python script that can reproduce your issue or just copy the script here if it is short .
