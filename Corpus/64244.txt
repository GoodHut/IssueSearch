 URL : "https://github.com/jbuehl/solaredge/issues/74" TITLE : for the newly initiated BODY : we have just had a new solar array installed and attached to a solaredge se 11400a inverter. like many before me i found out that to get the data from the system i would have to go through the solaredge server. so that's how i ended up here. on our particular inverter, there does not seem to be a place to set the ip address with no connection to a router . going to the lan setting it shows a modbus connection associating it with a tcp port in this case 502 . so question 1 is whether others see this and have figured out a way to set the ip address, while the other question is whether there is a step by step description of how to implement the monitoring for people who are not quite as skilled as those on this forum . the description on this url https://github.com/jbuehl/solaredge talk about acquiring the encryption key over an rs232 interface. my system does not have an rs 232 interface which adds to the complication many thanks, @jurijpar
