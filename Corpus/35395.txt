 URL : "https://github.com/geekish/crap/issues/8" TITLE : drop php 5.x support BODY : i would like to drop php 5.x support for 2.x, and maintain 1.x for 5.x. since i would be maintaining both versions, i want 1.x to be as feature-complete as possible. there exists a utility to 'convert' php 7 code to 5; see spatie/7to5 https://github.com/spatie/7to5 . see latitude/latitude https://github.com/shadowhand/latitude for an example of a project that uses this library to create releases targeting each php version.
