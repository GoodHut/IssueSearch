 URL : "https://github.com/peak3d/inputstream.adaptive/issues/83" TITLE : clean the dependencies BODY : i think that some of the dependencies can be limited to certain platforms or removed. i tested to build on linux x64 system without kodi-platform and p8-platform and the addon works fine removed find_package kodiplatform required and find_package p8-platform required and checked that the packages are not installed in the system . kodi-platform : i didn't find it used at all. p8-platform : i see that it's used only for windows in https://github.com/peak3d/inputstream.adaptive/blob/master/src/main.cpp l42. i would've sent a pr, but i can't test on other platforms windows and architectures arm .
