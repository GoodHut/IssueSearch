 URL : "https://github.com/Stevo-S/LoanManager/issues/64" TITLE : add transaction date BODY : there seems to be a need for an extra time stamp for the date the transaction took place that should be distinct from the current time stamp that only records the time the transaction was committed to the database. this additional time stamp should be input by the user. this then becomes very useful in digitizing old records since the date those transactions took place and the date they are stored in the application's database are likely to be vastly different.
