 URL : "https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/issues/1365" TITLE : one column not working BODY : my code https://github.com/galengold/split70/tree/master/qmk_firmware/keyboards/split70 i'm building a keyboard that's like the ergodox split, similar shape layout http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/ /gists/3709167c21216ea1294874d039502740 . when i flash my modified qmk, everything works except for column 6, attached to teensy port b0 left side of the right hand . i've checked and made sure it's not a pcb problem or a construction problem by doing connection tests and checking the wiring. i believe i've modified everything correctly, and going through the code i think everything is right. i have confirmed that this is purely a code issue by switching the bit shift for rows they're physically columns 6 and 7 in matrix.c: c switch row { case 6: ddrb |= 1<<0 ; becomes 1<<1 portb &= ~ 1<<0 ; becomes ~ 1<<1 break; case 7: ddrb |= 1<<1 ; becomes 1<<0 portb &= ~ 1<<1 ; becomes ~ 1<<0 break; this confirmed the column and teensy port worked. u, j, and m were output when y, h, and n were pressed. i have no idea why column 6 does this, and i am not familiar enough with the whole project to debug it into the protocol parts etc. any ideas?
