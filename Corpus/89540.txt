 URL : "https://github.com/micheloosterhof/cowrie/issues/419" TITLE : questions about artifacts BODY : i've played with it during the weekend and i have a couple of questions regarding it. 1 example of usage says that it should be initialized as a = artifact 'some_name' , but the __init__ definition clearly says that config must be passed as well. what is wrong there? 2 i could imagine how to use it for wget/curl/tftp, but how do you expect to use it for pipes ie. echo 'hex_encoded_data' > some_file; echo 'more_data' >> some_file ? when i tried it, it was hashing content of the file at each command at close method of artifact . so i end up with several files in dl folder instead of one.
