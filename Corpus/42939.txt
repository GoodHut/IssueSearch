 URL : "https://github.com/pysal/legendgram/issues/5" TITLE : center isn't centered BODY : the way i implemented center , it doesn't actually center-align the legend, it only pins the legend to a center coordinate. so, if you wanted a center-aligned legend, you'd need to specify the legend location to the left & set the width to span the figure. instead, i should probably implement centering as true centering with respect to image, as well as ensure that right-align is on the right edge of the image.
