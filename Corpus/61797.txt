BODY : hi! if i install stix2 with pip and try to parse json data from here https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-stix2-json-schemas/tree/master/examples/threat-reports i've got an error valueerror: can't parse unknown object type 'bundle'! , but if i install this package with cloning from git and using python setup.py install everything works fine. so i wonder what is the problem here? is it an old version on pypi or what? thanks!
