 URL : "https://github.com/omegahat/RClangSimple/issues/4" TITLE : method for children BODY : the children function does not have a method for functiondecl objects, so calling children on a routine accessed through getroutines does not work. a workaround is to use getchildren instead of children . as a minimal example, consider the file example.c : c int f { return 0; } we can load this file with rcindex to reproduce the error: r library rcindex tu = createtu example.c r = getroutines tu children r$f error in visitchildren top, f, clone = true : no slot of name ref for this object of class functiondecl this bug affects the current commit of rcindex.
