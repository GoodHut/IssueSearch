 URL : "https://github.com/vermiculus/magithub/issues/175" TITLE : some things i've noticed BODY : - magithub.org needs updating. - most importantly ghub-get /user nil :auth 'magithub . - there are also some org syntax issues. - a toc would be nice, i find myself scrolling up and down a lot while writing this. - the information about hub should probably not come so earlier. just a few days ago a user reported that they installed hub and things didn't work afterwards. by not putting information about hub before that about ghub that could be avoided. but i would move it even further out of sight. - did you try https://github.com/magit/magit/pull/3134 yet? - ignore the stubs added in the last two commits. - i will resume working on this again shortly. - that should cover the things that magithub still needs hub for. further reason to move information about that out of sight. - magithub: offline; use c-p g to refresh github content or h o to go back online... - i want that line for the offline , but the rest i would like to turn of using an option or something. - the order in the popup doesn't make much sense to me. does it assume a certain number of columns? then you should enforce it. - h eaten by github toggle magithub-status integration does that locally set a git variable? then you should probably display the value in the popup. - g	refresh this section only you shouldn't mess with that. g is supposed to always refresh all of the current buffer.
