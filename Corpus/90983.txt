 URL : "https://github.com/benjaminj6/twirl-js/issues/3" TITLE : support for media queries BODY : currently doesn't support nesting media queries inside of the template. this shouldn't be too much effort to add if it requires the & or an @media before the query itself. the implementation result should look similar to support for pseudoclasses https://github.com/benjaminj6/twirl-js/issues/2
