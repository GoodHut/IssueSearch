 URL : "https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/8804" TITLE : perl 5 not perl 6 layer BODY : i originally opened 7758, but is was mistakenly assumed to be a duplicate of 5019 which is for perl 6. perl 5 and perl 6 are two different languages. so don't erroneously close this one. i am opening this issue so that those interested in a perl 5 layer can input what they would like included. 8572 is an attempt at perl 5 layer but is too messy to be merged in its current state. some of the packages that i would like to include would be plsense https://github.com/aki2o/emacs-plsense - auto-completion dumb jump https://github.com/jacktasia/dumb-jump - jump to definition perl-flycheck http://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/ - linting and syntax checking helm perldoc https://github.com/syohex/emacs-helm-perldoc - perldoc browsing perlnow https://github.com/doomvox/perlnow - improved perl debugger pde https://github.com/wenbinye/emacs-pde - useful perl utilities we could also include a fix for 480 once we have an idea of what we want, i can put together a pr. hopeful once 8686 is resolved it can actually get merged. @alexdaniel @theckman
