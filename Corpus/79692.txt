 URL : "https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-android/issues/265" TITLE : split screen crashes app BODY : feel free to ask questions, i'm only parroting from otrs ticket service and will get back to the user if needed: problem is on android 7.1: user says that it breaks the app when he tries to do split screen. here's a small screencap animation that the user sent. https://drive.google.com/file/d/0b9klzqhltupvrxlnywy4mvvnaw8/view this issue is not dependent on which app kiwix shares the screen with, it only seems to happen when the user resizes the secondary app window to its smallest size. the issue does not occur when user opens kiwix as the secondary app.
