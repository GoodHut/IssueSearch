 URL : "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/2379" TITLE : key permission error BODY : my issue is exactly the same with the one that is reported here https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/2122 : file /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/synapse/config/tls.py , line 130, in generate_files with open tls_private_key_path, w as private_key_file: ioerror: errno 13 permission denied: '/etc/letsencrypt/live/--------/privkey.pem' however: the files actually do exist in the letsencrypt folder. the permissions are ok. the only thing that may be causing this is that the files are not actually files since certbot is using softlinks in the live folder to point to the archive folder. in order to see if that was the issue, i pointed homeserver.yaml directly to the actual files in the archive folder of letsencrypt but the matrix-synapse service still failed to start. the permission denied message persists this time on the actual files, in the archive folder of letsencrypt . notice that the files are fully readable and writable by anyone even though matrix-synapse should not be opening them for writing in any case . in order to make sure that the path actually exists, i copied the path from my homeserver.yaml file and pasted it in a vim command to make sure that there are no typos in the path somewhere: i can directly open the files through vim. i'm pretty lost as to what may be causing this problem since the default certificate and key are working without issues. could there be that synapse is expecting the file to have a specific extension like crt or key ? anyone has any idea what may be causing this?
