 URL : "https://github.com/ConsenSys/gnosis-contracts/issues/35" TITLE : isranged bool is redundant BODY : i noticed in the smart contract eventfactor that event that isranged is a bool but upper_bound and lower_bound are constrained in a way that could be used to represent this condition without the extra field. in particular, if upper_bound < lower_bound you might interpret that to mean that the event is not ranged. whereas if upper_bound > lower_bound you could assume the event is ranged. also note that the existing code https://github.com/consensys/gnosis-contracts/blob/master/contracts/solidity/eventfactory/eventfactory.sol l248 has a problem in that lower_bound might equal upper_bound in which case division by zero is possible. if there is a bug bounty program in place i would like to participate in that if possible for this division by zero bug if it turns out to be legit. please contact me privately at cilibrar@gmail.com if the bug bounty program gets going and i am eligible. thank you for your time.
