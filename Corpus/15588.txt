 URL : "https://github.com/mooneyj/pedalpower-interface/issues/2" TITLE : esp sdk webserver BODY : it seems the fastest way to implement a webserver on the esp8266's is using espressif's sdk webserver. here https://github.com/internetofhomethings/esp8266-mqtt-http-server implements an sdk webserver alongside a native arduino http server and an mqtt server, and finds the sdk to be fastest as it implements callback functions . this code is useful as it contains working sdk webserver code .ino for the esp8266 and a html page which succesfully communicates. we need to modify the server code to push the pedalpower data and replace the html with a fancy website.
