 URL : "https://github.com/lightblue-platform/lightblue-core/issues/770" TITLE : arbitrary logic execution BODY : it might be cool if you could submit a sequential batch request where a mid-step took the output of the first query, ran some simple logic, and then allowed it to be a query/projection parameter on the next. stored procedures might be one way to approach this, but it might be interesting if the logic could be arbitrary provided by the client as a request. clearly, this would introduce some risk, but i could also see some advantages such as hashing a password for comparison in the next.
