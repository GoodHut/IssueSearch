 URL : "https://github.com/digimezzo/Dopamine/issues/271" TITLE : local .lrc files support BODY : when even there is local .lrc files relevant to the tracks, dopamine seems still ignoring them. so in 1.3 release, can there be an option to display them directly instead of downloading them online again? plus, if you ask what kind of .lrc files can be treated as relevant, i may say the same file name except the file type suffix. but i don't know if i'm right.
