 URL : "https://github.com/YuvalNirkin/face_swap/issues/12" TITLE : confict with opencv3.3.0 BODY : in opencv 3.3.0 and its contribs, it seems the functions like cv2::face::createlbphfacerecognizer have been changed into cv2::face::lbphfacerecognizer_create ... and i've tried so many times and thought it was the compiling part went wrong... but it wasn't... so it would be nice to show that the version of opencv should below 3.3.0 :cry:
