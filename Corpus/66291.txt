 URL : "https://github.com/fengyuanchen/cropperjs/issues/231" TITLE : minification breaks css BODY : we use the human readable version of the cropper.css file in our project, and then optionally minify it based on a configuration setting. when minifying, the library we use breaks the css because some of the values in the original cropper.css file are not terminated with a semicolon. to avoid issues with minification, i'd suggest that cropper.css is modified such that semicolons are always used, even for the last value within a selector.
