 URL : "https://github.com/dazinator/DnnPackager/issues/68" TITLE : dnnpackage keeps crashing BODY : it seems to be a common experience now when i load up a project, i see the following right after the package manager console prompt : pm> dnnpackager: solution post build targets file already exists. overwriting.. dnnpackager: solution before build targets file already exists. dnnpackager: imported dnnpackager powershell cmdlets. then hitting the enter key produces this in red highlight : dnnpackager: : the term 'dnnpackager:' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again. at line:1 char:1 + dnnpackager: solution post build targets file already exists. overwri ... + ~~~~~~~~~~~~ + categoryinfo : objectnotfound: dnnpackager::string , commandnotfoundexception + fullyqualifiederrorid : commandnotfoundexception then executing any command just crashes dnnpackager. sometimes closing the solution and reopening fixes it for a while, but then it comes back. this is really disruptive to our development flow. ;-
