 URL : "https://github.com/binaryage/dirac/issues/65" TITLE : fix node.js discovery page BODY : devtools code uses devtoolsapi.sendmessagetoembedder to communicate with embedder. this functionality is optional and devtools stubs those apis for web-hosted mode which is effective when dirac extension opens devtools as a separate web app . unfortunately, some new functionality relies on this interaction and fails with stubbed api. specifically new node discovery page uses setdevicesupdatesenabled to receive initial config. we will have to implement this on our side somehow to keep that functionality working. see inspectorfrontendhost.js for api initialisation.
