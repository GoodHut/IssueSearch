 URL : "https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/issues/298" TITLE : support for sjplot BODY : i would like to ask if it would be possible to support the sjplot package, more specifically the sjtable function http://www.strengejacke.de/sjplot/sjtbasics/ and https://github.com/strengejacke/sjplot . the reason is, that sjplot seems to support the widest range of r models for printing summary tables e.g. lme4 objects and generates a very pleasant table style. however, it only generates html output which does not render correctly when trying to knit to pdf. would it be possible to develop a wrapper around sjplot which translates the html into proper latex?
