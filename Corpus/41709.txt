 URL : "https://github.com/ZuInnoTe/hadoopoffice/issues/11" TITLE : add date localization BODY : while we do support reading localized data in excel, dates are always return in us format mm/dd/yyyy . the reason is that excel stores them always in us format and converts them at the user interface level, if needed cf. https://poi.apache.org/apidocs/org/apache/poi/ss/usermodel/dataformatter.html . we could write functionality which reads the option hadoopoffice.read.locale.date.convert.pattern which has as a value a date pattern, such as dd mmmm, yyyy . additionally, a locale can be specified in bcp47 format using the option hadoopoffice.read.locale.data.convert.locale.bcp47 e.g. ja for japanese apache poi has a corresponding date formatter: https://poi.apache.org/apidocs/org/apache/poi/ss/util/dateformatconverter.html if both options are not set then no conversion will take place default behavior . if only one of each option is specified a warning will be logged and no conversion will take place ie default behavior will be assumed .
