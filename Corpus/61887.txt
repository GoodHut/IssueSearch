 URL : "https://github.com/aumayr/fava-electron/issues/4" TITLE : build process is broken BODY : hi, i was interested to give fava-electron a try, but found the build process was broken. first, i found i had to replace the fava repo url, and i additionally specified a shallow clone to speed things up: build/fava: git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:beancount/fava.git build/fava then i got another error and found i had to install pyinstaller in order to get the stuff to work. pip3 install pyinstaller then i got a stacktrace see attached file stacktrace.txt https://github.com/aumayr/fava-electron/files/717331/stacktrace.txt that i don't quite understand. could you help to update/fix the repo and get things running properly? thx, johannes
