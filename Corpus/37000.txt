 URL : "https://github.com/jeromekelleher/msprime/issues/314" TITLE : is_sample or flags ? BODY : a minor but sufficiently confusing issue that i think it's worth fixing up: for a nodetable, dump_text and load_text uses the is_sample column; whereas print gives a flags column, so you can't paste the output from print directly into a file and load_text it you must change the header . solutions: 1. change print to output is_sample instead of flags 2. change dump_text and load_text to use flags instead of is_sample 3. allow load_text to take either, or possibly both columns, as implemented here https://github.com/petrelharp/msprime/tree/load_flags i think the best option may be 1 ; since no other flags are currently being used. but, if you think it's likely you'll be adding other flags, then 3 ; what's lacking to merge that implementation is a test or two.
