 URL : "https://github.com/commandlineparser/commandlineX/issues/4" TITLE : additional help text BODY : from commandline created by ohadschn https://github.com/ohadschn : commandlineparser/commandline 6 afaik all help text is currently associated with either a specific option / value or a usage example as well as the assembly's title, copyright, and version . however it would be nice to be able to add some general/additional information to the help text, for example: cs helptext scans the network for foo. see more information at https://foo.com public class myoptions { option ... foo... } this text could be added to the top of the help text, or even: cs tophelptext scans the network for foo bottomhelptext see more information at https://foo.com public class myoptions { option ... foo... } i realize custom help text could be used to achieve this, but i think these and https://github.com/commandlineparser/commandline/issues/5 would cover the majority of users and keep them happy with the built-in default rather than use their own helptext class etc . ideally there would be a way to define both options-specific text like the above and app-general text which would be printed regardless of the options class used. an assembly attribute could be used for this, maybe assemblydescription https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.assemblydescriptionattribute%28v=vs.110%29.aspx?f=255&mspperror=-2147217396 ?
