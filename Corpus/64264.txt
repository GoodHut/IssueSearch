 URL : "https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/nwb-schema/issues/57" TITLE : format addition request BODY : hi everyone, i would like to make quite a large number of suggested additions to the nwb data model. short story: we have developed a relational database system for keeping track of data in our lab. we have been using it for several months now and are happy with it. we based the schema on nwb 1.0 but there were many additions needed in order to capture all the data we need to store. while doing this we also had in mind the forthcoming ibl project, and i believe that these additions to the data model will cover most of what is needed there also. the full data model is at: http://alyx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models.html it's formatted as a django specification. all the best, kenneth.
