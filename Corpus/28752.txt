BODY : this package comes with some basic podo componets, but they are not most recent. i tried to replace default podo with the podo for our real drc-hubo, but the build failed with the reason of missing some libraries which should installed with xenomai. however, the podo in this package work without any dependency from xenomai. how do i use the most recent podo with this package?
