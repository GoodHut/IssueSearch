 URL : "https://github.com/ChronixDB/chronix.server/issues/140" TITLE : time series resampling BODY : according to the list of available transformation operations, chronix does currently not support resampling or am i missing something? . since i need this feature urgently, i would implement it myself. is there anything important to consider? i would implement it as a transformation operation that expects the new frequency size, similar to the movingaverage transformation. then i would apply the mean to obtain one value per interval, what might be configurable in an improved version.
