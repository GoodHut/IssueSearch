 URL : "https://github.com/esbenp/prettier-vscode/issues/128" TITLE : errors not going away BODY : if i make a syntax error, prettier shows me the error bar at the top that says unexpected error, expected , , or something along those lines. that's fine, but i find it a bit frustrating that these errors don't go away after a set time period, or if when i then save again and fix my error, the message doesn't go away. in addition, any new messages seem to stack, whereas potentially it would be better to simply have the newest message replace any others. i'm proposing some changes such that: 1. only one error message ever shown at once 2. the error messages time out after x seconds could be turned on/off in config 3. on a successful format, any prettier errors are removed. i am happy to take a stab at a pr if you think anything along these lines would be useful : thanks for all your hard work with the extension ðŸŽ‰
