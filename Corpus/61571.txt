 URL : "https://github.com/marko9777x/Fantasy-Premier-League/issues/1" TITLE : basic structure changes BODY : hey, @marko9777x ! please consider my advice: 1. do not use private classes. instead, the top level classes you created should be java packages, and the private classes should be normal classes inside those packages. 2. classes should be named like things, not like verbs. for example: datastorage is a good name, but findingdata is not. perhaps you can use a name like: datafinder . please apply this logic to the rest of the classes. 3. remove the public static void main methods. we will not need them at all.
