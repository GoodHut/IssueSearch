 URL : "https://github.com/annayqho/TheCannon/issues/72" TITLE : dataset input parameters? BODY : @aceilers -- i was wondering wha the coeff_old and scatter_old parameters are in the dataset code. they cause my existing code to break : . are they temporary or should we find a way to incorporate them? perhaps we could make them optional parameters like _coeff_old and _scatter_old ?
