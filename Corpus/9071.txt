 URL : "https://github.com/KC3Kai/KC3Kai/issues/1905" TITLE : taking my leave BODY : this issue is just for an announcement and can be closed after few days. here i officially announce that i'm leaving from both dev team and translator duty for scn. because i can't find another solution for dealing with a childish and irresponsible developer - i've tried to be reasonable, despite several times end up in anger, but it never worked. and sadly he is the only active one around - with only two people there's no way of telling the other what's a common sense. i'm fed up. feel free to remove me from teams as well, i'm pretty much prefer pr approach anyways - given that there's a need. while i'm leaving there are several maintenance stuff i want to point out as my final contribution: - whenever any of the remodeling chain changes, overwrite tools/remodelgroups.json in kc3-translations with output of remodeldb.dumpremodelgroups - regarding quotes of scn translation, there is a section on https://github.com/kc3kai/kc3-translations/tree/master/data/scn about how to update it - for kancollehelpers, take a look at https://github.com/javran/purescript-kancolle-helpers, run scripts/mkrelease.sh to generate a new version to overwrite file with the same name under src/assets/js , you don't have to do this very often, only when there are changes to battle mechanism or expeditions, after i have adjusted the code accordingly. - for how i mark node letters, take a look at maptool part of https://github.com/javran/kantour, keep in mind that while edge numbers are 100% correct, node letters are guessed by the program and you might modify some of them to respect the actual letter on map. thanks fellows, it was a good time.
