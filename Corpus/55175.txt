 URL : "https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/issues/19" TITLE : improve error handling BODY : based on comments in 18, it seems error handling needs some work: 1. capture stderr and perhaps stdout from relevant subprocesses, so it doesn't get lost and can be reported automatically along with the traceback. 2. we should record the docker version and kubectl version in the bug report.
