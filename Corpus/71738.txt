 URL : "https://github.com/sho-87/cognitive-battery/issues/16" TITLE : adding new task settings BODY : if task settings have already been saved, adding new task settings options in the future for new tasks will be a problematic default settings are only saved during first run i.e. if the .ini file doesnt already exist . if a project is already in progress it will have settings saved i.e. not first run . so adding any new task options in the future will not have defaults saved as the .ini already exists, so will error when trying to read from non-existing settings. the .ini cannot be deleted for existing projects because you will have to reset all the options again may a solution is to try/catch the reading of potentially non-existing settings, and save defaults at that point instead of only during a first run
