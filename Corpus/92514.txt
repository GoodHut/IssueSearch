 URL : "https://github.com/ganeti/ganeti/issues/1090" TITLE : xl migration requires ssh BODY : originally reported of google code with id 1034. currently, only master candidates can ssh into other nodes. however, with the switch to xl, instance migration needs ssh access. this means that currently only migrations from master candidates to other nodes can be made and not vice versa. the solution would be to create a dedicated ssh key which is shared by all nodes and which is restricted to the migration command. originally added on 2015-03-03 13:20:10 +0000 utc.
