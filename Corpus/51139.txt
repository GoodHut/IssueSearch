 URL : "https://github.com/plus3it/dotc-gitlab/issues/1" TITLE : add smtp relay support BODY : notifications are not reliable mailing direct from deployed instance. add functionality to mail through an authenticated relay service e.g., ses . will likely need to add parms for: - relay fqdn - relay user - relay password - relay port may be able to compress fqdn/port into a single parm. may also be able to compress credentials into a single parm though that likely limits tokens available for complex passwords
