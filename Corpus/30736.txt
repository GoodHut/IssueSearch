 URL : "https://github.com/SteveLTN/https-portal/issues/109" TITLE : question 0 downtime BODY : hello there, i have fully configured my service for https-portal, unique issue i'am currently having is next use case: i have app1 => app1.domain and app2 => app2.domain running through the https-portal. so far so good. everything is perfect. i can access app1.domain and i can access app2.domain after deploying both apps. the problem: - on next day i added some one feature to app1. - i stop my service, which is app1, build it and start it. result: 403 forbidden on page of app1 403 forbidden on page of app2 analysis: the 403 error is coming derived from ip change by docker. this is my config for https-portal: version: '2' services: https-portal: image: steveltn/https-portal:1 ports: - '80:80' - '443:443' volumes: - ./configs:/etc/nginx/conf.d/:rw - ./nginx-conf-default:/var/lib/nginx-conf/:rw - /data/ssl_certs:/var/lib/https-portal:rw - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro network_mode: 'bridge' environment: stage: staging websocket: true resolver: 127.0.0.11 ipv6=off valid=30s dynamic_upstream: true this is example of my frontend config, which is similar of any app im running: version: '2' services: app1-frontend: container_name: app1-frontend build: context: ./app1-frontend environment: - virtual_host=app1.domain depends_on: - app1-backend network_mode: bridge hope there is a good solution for my problem and thanks in advance for your time! igors sigalovs
