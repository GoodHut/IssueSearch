 URL : "https://github.com/CogComp/cogcomp-nlp/issues/400" TITLE : documentation for java api BODY : hi, i downloaded the latest stable? version 3.0.23 from: https://cogcomp.cs.illinois.edu/page/download_view/netagger i cannot find the documentation, and the read me file is to thin on details. i want to call the ner on a string, have entities tagged, and get the entities as well as their positions in text. i use java. i noticed the github read me is more detailed, but cannot be used with the 3.0.23 version. i know i can probably download the latest version from github and build a .jar that is, if the github version is tested , but i thought i would ask to see if there is documentation for the 3.0.23 version or a dist jar for the latest version already. thank you.
