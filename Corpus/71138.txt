 URL : "https://github.com/facebook/folly/issues/556" TITLE : about compile option -o2 BODY : i wrote an simple example to compare the performance between fbstring and std::string, the results show that when i cmopile the program without compile option -o2 , the performance of fbstring is not good as std::string , but when i use -o2 option, the performance of fbstring is almost twice faster than std::string . does it mean the -o2 option is necessary for fbstring?
