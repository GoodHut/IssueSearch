 URL : "https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui/issues/132" TITLE : figure out getlasterror BODY : the call to getlasterror in issue 108 seemed to be picking up a random error oserror: winerror 38 reached the end of the file. that i'm almost certain was not caused by pyautogui. i've commented out this line since i don't think it ever gets triggered by a legitimate problem, but i'm opening this issue so that we have a record to come back to to check this out.
