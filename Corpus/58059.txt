 URL : "https://github.com/DiscipleTools/disciple-tools/issues/254" TITLE : roles: strategist role BODY : question: have we created/implemented a strategist role that lets them see the back end and edit some custom listsâ€¦ i.e. locations, sources, etc? answer: the plugin config menu in the admin is governed by the 'manage_dt' capability, whereas the other settings for the admin are governed by the 'manage_options' capability. so we have an easy separation from strategist vs administrator. but i have to check / test the strategist role that it is configured for this. - review the strategist role and make sure it has access to the wp-admin, 'manage_dt' capability, and all the post types.
