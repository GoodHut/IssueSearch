 URL : "https://github.com/ahmedahamid/temp-third/issues/184" TITLE : wic: enumerate components BODY : seems to be very tricky to get list of installed bitmap encoders and decoders and other components via the iwicimagingfactory::createcomponentenumerator which is unavailable in wpf. the correct code with .net 4.0 interop features would be very useful, and returning codecinfo in the case of encoders/decoders welcomed. this work item was migrated from codeplex codeplex work item id: '7684' vote count: '1'
