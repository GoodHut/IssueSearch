 URL : "https://github.com/ucb-bar/chisel-testers/issues/82" TITLE : does verbose not work? BODY : i have something like: val options = new testeroptionsmanager { testeroptions = testeroptions isverbose = true, backendname = verilator , // todo: figure out what isgenverilog really does isgenverilog = true } dsptools.driver.execute => new cordicstage p, 0 , 1 , options { c => new cordictester c } should be true it's definitely using verilator instead of firrtl-interpreter, but it's not printing out my peeks/pokes/expects. for dsppeek,dsppoke,dspexpect, it prints out dspexpect but not dspp .
