 URL : "https://github.com/jaredpalmer/react-production-starter/issues/197" TITLE : nested layouts for routes BODY : i love the boilerplate but am having issues having nested layouts for instances export default <route path='/' component={baselayout}> <route path='auth' component={auth} /> <route component={authenticatedlayout}> <route path= dashboard component={dashboard} /> <route path='inbox' component={inbox} /> </route> </route> in this instance, you can see that the authenticated routes have another layout applied to it. but this boilerplate defines a different way to construct your routes such as export default function createroutes store { return { path: 'posts', getcomponents location, cb { require.ensure './containers/postlist', './reducer' , require => { let postpage = require './containers/postlist' .default let postreducer = require './reducer' .default injectasyncreducer store, 'posts', postreducer cb null, postpage } } } } so i would love assistance on this topic!
