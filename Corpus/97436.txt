 URL : "https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/237" TITLE : gps movement is too smooth BODY : the gps movement shown is really hard to judge, particularly when near large buildings, where the calculated position is distorted. this is due to excessive filtering on the computed position coordinates, which highly over-weights the historical coordinates the gps has provided. please consider either an option, or a default, to reduce the level of temporal smoothing done on the gps position. it currently sluggishly sloshes about in a confusing way. a more accurate jump is fine, and doesn't give the impression of the gps being accurate when it clearly is not. its quite confusing to be standing still and have the gps do little smooth sloshes. having it perform discrete jumps is easier to tell how accurate the gps actually is being i realise there is the circle, but it can't show biasses very well. only statistical error. , without having to wait a few minutes to figure it out from the slow wobbles.
