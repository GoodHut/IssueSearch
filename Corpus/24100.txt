 URL : "https://github.com/sixeyed/docker-on-windows/issues/1" TITLE : secrets on windows BODY : do you think it will be good/viable solution instead of modifying code to accomodate for docker secrets instead have all secret management as part of entrypoint dockerfile reference. that is to have logic in entrypoint to import/modify secrets at container start and update relevant web.config, configuration references. this 1. do not require modification of application pool runas or any other security aspects of running application since entrypoint is executed as containeradmin 2. do not require any source code modification
