 URL : "https://github.com/NOAA-PMEL/Ferret/issues/1527" TITLE : double precision pplus BODY : reported by ansley b manke on 31 mar 2015 17:41 utc in this message, http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/maillists/tmap/ferret_users/fu_2015/msg00091.html the user wants to show color levels ranging from 1.e-09 to 2.8 contour/fill/levels= 0 1e-09 , 1e-08 , 1e-07 , 1e-06 , 1e-05 , 0.0001 , 0.001 , 0.01 , 0.1 , 0.4 , 0.8 , 1.2 , 1.6 , 2.0 , 2.4 , 2.8 inf icnc2 but the data becomes single-precision when sent into pplus so the smallest details are lost. a second example, in this old ticket, 1515 and the question here, http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/maillists/tmap/ferret_users/fu_2015/msg00113.html have time axes with origins long in the past but fine delta-time. the time axis on the plot is messed up. this is also due to the precision - coordinate data in pplus is single-precision. these could be fixed within ferret by subtracting a time offset. we should investigate what parts of pplus should be made single-precision to get the accuracy needed for these graphics. setting this low priority for now. there are workarounds, but it would be better if these things would work seamlessly. migrated-from: http://dunkel.pmel.noaa.gov/trac/ferret/ticket/2255
