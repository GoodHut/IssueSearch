 URL : "https://github.com/blakgeek/cordova-plugin-firebase-database/issues/2" TITLE : android compile issue BODY : as i mentioned in another issue i was able to get your plugin working in android and ios. i had to do some munging to get it to compile in both platforms. when i first played with it in android i have to manually make some changes in order to get it to compile. the first issue was that your code requires source compat of 1.7 or higher otherwise there would be a compile error: error: 30, 58 error: diamond operator is not supported in -source 1.6 use -source 7 or higher to enable diamond operator my platforms/android/build.gradle file had the following: compileoptions { sourcecompatibility javaversion.version_1_6 targetcompatibility javaversion.version_1_6 } i had to change the gradle file in order to get it to compile. obviously i should not be manually editing this file. i'm wondering how you are getting by this issue. i have some other things that i had to change but let's just start with this one :- btw - from what i have played with so far this plugin has been working well.
