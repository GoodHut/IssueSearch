 URL : "https://github.com/upenn-acg/dune/issues/2" TITLE : os breaking bug BODY : running programs under the sandbox which fork/exec a subprocess, where that child fails with some error seems to leave the process running at 100% cpu. worst of all, this process becomes unkillabe even with kill -9 . only way to fix is it to restart the system, which may be difficult as the os tries to wait for the processes to end gracefully before shutting down... i don't think dune handles signals properly? or it's a bug with the kernel module?
