 URL : "https://github.com/vmware/harbor/issues/2842" TITLE : full registry replication BODY : as an administrator i would like to enable full registry replication in addition to the more fine granular replication available in harbor today. this is useful for harbor ha scenarios and also for registries with a lot of projects & images. it is one of the feature requests i hear most often from customers. one could also tag projects with a priority tag so their images get replicated with higher priority.
