 URL : "https://github.com/leonsoft-kras/transmisson-remote-gui/issues/977" TITLE : geoip support for ipv6 BODY : currently we use geolite country database from maxmind, they also have a ipv6 version here: http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/geoipv6.dat.gz, we may consider to support for country resolving. btw, according to their license, we may need to declare that the database is from maxmind when downloading the database, not sure if i missed anything but i didn't see we mention that anywhere.
