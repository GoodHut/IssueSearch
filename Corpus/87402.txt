 URL : "https://github.com/20c/graphsrv/issues/11" TITLE : legend text box too large BODY : the translucent black box the legends are in extends to far to the right and makes it harder to read part of the graphs. should be limited to the width of the text. would also be nice to have an option to make it transparent instead of translucent.
