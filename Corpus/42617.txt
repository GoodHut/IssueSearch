 URL : "https://github.com/wit-ai/wit/issues/858" TITLE : bug - location entity BODY : do you want to request a feature , report a bug , or ask a question about wit? bug what is the current behavior? i trained the entity on synonyms of the following sentence: do you have open positions and do you have open positions in x first bug: using wit/location, positions was being recognized as a location, while it was trained on cities word which do not correlate to positions at all. second bug: i made a custom location entity, using keyword-freetext search on custom words. it started to recognize cities fine, however if a question mark was lacking at the end, it wasn't able to recognize the entity the trained data was with a question mark at the end of the sentence . punctuation should not matter during train process. if the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. i have explained above. what is the expected behavior? punctuation should not matter. wit/location should not be able to recognize non-correlated words. maybe a new entity can be trained that would only capture cities/villages? since currently wit/location captures street names as well, so i can see where the issue could come from. what is the app id where you are experiencing this issue if applicable ? 5a017c34-c903-4b8b-9796-490e81d305bd i have removed wit/location for now
