 URL : "https://github.com/phetsims/a11y-research/issues/52" TITLE : test jaws with firefox BODY : based on http://www.freedomscientific.com/products/blindness/jaws, it seems like vfo is transitioning from ie11 to firefox. > works with microsoft office, internet explorer, firefox, and much more. we are considering transitioning support from ie11 to firefox as well because ie11 does not support web audio. if we can use firefox, we can more easily assume that sonification will be available and layer with description content. we will ask our friends at the idrc about this change. we should also test aria support and how jaws behaves on firefox ourselves.
