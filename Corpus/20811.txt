 URL : "https://github.com/srophe/srophe-app-data/issues/728" TITLE : cts urns for spear BODY : @wsalesky, as we discussed in our recent meeting with dave, i'm interested in getting cts urns into spear so that we can display syriac text on the factoid page along with a link to the corpus. the editors discussed cts urns in our meeting today and i have a couple of questions. 1. i would like to propose adding a bibl type= urn with a ptr target= urn inside the bibl. example: <bibl type= urn > <ptr target= urn:cts:syriaclit:nhsl8559.syriaccorpus57:8 /> </bibl> does this sound right to you? would you find something else preferable? if this sounds fine to you, i'll tweak the schema to allow it. 2. would you be able to add this data with a script? it would need to find instances of //bibl/ptr target= http://syriaca.org/bibl/633 , grab the text node of the following sibling citedrange element, and add that text node as the section number of the cts urn as in the example above? for now we would only want to do this for the chronicle of edessa https://github.com/srophe/srophe-app-data/blob/dev/data/spear/tei/chronicle_of_edessa.xml but eventually we would want to modify this script for other spear tei so i think writing a script is worth it. the goal would be to take <bibl type= primary > <ptr target= http://syriaca.org/bibl/633 /> <citedrange unit= pp >8</citedrange> </bibl> and add a sibling div <bibl type= urn > <ptr target= urn:cts:syriaclit:nhsl8559.syriaccorpus57:8 /> </bibl>
