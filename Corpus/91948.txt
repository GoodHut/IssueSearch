 URL : "https://github.com/edoddridge/MIM/issues/10" TITLE : use a 64-bit value for pi BODY : no reason to lose accuracy for a dozen source code characters. from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/507819/pi-and-accuracy-of-a-floating-point-number, 3.1415926535897932384 should be sufficient. i am loath to just do this myself until more of the testing is in place. ideally, from my point of view, i would see accuracy improve slightly from making the change. @edoddridge, if you feel differently, don't let me stop you from just editing the file and closing this ticket.
