 URL : "https://github.com/scikit-rf/scikit-rf/issues/117" TITLE : std_s_deg not in api list BODY : any reason std_s_deg is not in the api list in the scikit-rf documentation http://scikit-rf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/skrf.networkset.networkset.html skrf.networkset.networkset ? tested in my code that it exist, but not much description of it. as indicated here https://github.com/scikit-rf/scikit-rf/blob/ecb1a0e74dfeb5eb837e9d7eaf55e6317cda17d5/skrf/networkset.py i am just assuming that it behaves like std_s_db but i did not verify it yet. thoughts?
