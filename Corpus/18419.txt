 URL : "https://github.com/jmockit/jmockit1/issues/498" TITLE : tags for releases BODY : hi, it would be great if there would be tags in the repository to mark the releases that correspond with the maven artifacts. i have a fork https://github.com/neich/jmockit1/ of jmockit with prime path coverage and every time i want to merge a new version i have to guess which commit i have to use. right now i am using the commits that say something like increased version number or version increase to 1.37 , but i'm not sure if this is the exact point used for the artifact at maven central. a simple git tag would be great. thanks in advance.
