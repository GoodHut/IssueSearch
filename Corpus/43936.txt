 URL : "https://github.com/alda-lang/alda-lang.github.io/issues/13" TITLE : docs: setup and usage BODY : see 8 for context. this should be done by modifying the docs folder in alda-lang/alda https://github.com/alda-lang/alda . the docs are kept in sync with releases and used to generate http://alda.readthedocs.io, which will be cnamed to docs.alda.io. the docs should have a page guiding the reader through: - installing alda - learning about midi soundfonts and optionally installing one to make alda sound better - learning about the available text editor plugins this information is currently all in the readme: https://github.com/alda-lang/alda installation https://github.com/alda-lang/alda midi-soundfonts https://github.com/alda-lang/alda editor-plugins once we've moved it to the docs, we can replace those parts of the readme with a link to the docs. i think this page could also include some very basic usage examples like what we have here https://github.com/alda-lang/alda demo , and then suggest that the reader either read the alda command-line client docs for more technical information, or proceed to the tutorial section for a guided tour of alda.
