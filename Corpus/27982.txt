 URL : "https://github.com/RobertLuptonTheGood/eups/issues/111" TITLE : eups remove failing BODY : on all the packages i've tried running it on, eups remove fails with: eups remove: '>' not supported between instances of 'product' and 'product' since eups remove is a relatively infrequently-used command, i suspect it's broken everywhere, but if anyone has trouble reproducing, i can work harder to figure out what's making my system special.
