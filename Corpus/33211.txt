 URL : "https://github.com/roy-t/AStar/issues/3" TITLE : add caching of paths BODY : as long as the weights in the grid haven't changed a path you've previously computed is still valid. it might be a good idea to add caching. requirements - caching should be separated from the main algorithm to keep everything simple - the api for the cachedgrid ?? should be compatible with the grid api. - this feature should be compatible with adding multi-threading/tasks.
