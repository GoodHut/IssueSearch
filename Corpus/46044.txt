 URL : "https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/opendht/issues/212" TITLE : lack of documentation BODY : i don't want to sound petty, but there tends to be a problem if i have to read the header files in order to understand the public interfaces i have access to. it seems that some functions have doxygen style comments to them but only a few and doxyfile.in doesn't seem to compile correctly unless there is a cmake flag i need to use, which i have not found documented in readme.md or the wiki https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/opendht/wiki/build-the-library either . perhaps creating a general doxyfile in the root directory and adding more doxygen-style comments on the rest of the elements would help. thanks.
