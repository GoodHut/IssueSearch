 URL : "https://github.com/xpdAcq/xpdAcq/issues/399" TITLE : enh: improve end_beamtime BODY : as reported, _end_beamtime might take a long time if there were large amounts of images collected. if the previous user didn't run end_beamtime ahead of time, that might cause a delay for the next user. current approach: bundle but not compress xpduser to remote backup place bottleneck: the network speed between local workstation at xpd and the remote storage managed by nsls-ii. proposed solution: 1. since new beamtime generally starts with a fresh terminal and new user usually has less interest in the old beamtime, we can use the fact and instruct the user to run end_beamtime at a different terminal. therefore, this end_beatime can take indefinitely long time and the system dialogue about archiving wouldn't bother the new user. 2. exclude tiffs while archiving to avoid network issue and provide a tool for beamline staff to recover all the tiffs collected within certain beamtime. add-on: progress bar. this can assure the user that program is still working. ref: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/progressbar2/3.20.0
