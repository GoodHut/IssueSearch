BODY : in gitlab by @ngauvin on apr 4, 2017, 09:43 i saw core/utils/unit.{cpp,h} files... 1. do you have already a list of pre-defined units ? i saw only deg and c ? 2. what the official units of the framework ? i mean, what units should be used for the print out ? 3. concerning the geometrybuildertgeo, i propose that it works internally in cm. even if there is no system of units in root, some functions in tgeo assumes cm, s, g/cm3, gev and degrees. for example, when computing shape capacities or volume weight. the main motivation is that external interface tools assumes cm and will do proper conversion. g4root, for instance, will convert all volumes from cm to mm when building the g4 geometry. note that this is easy to change ! we are not really constrained by that. 4. do you have examples using units ? how to use your system ?
