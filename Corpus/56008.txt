 URL : "https://github.com/hejianxian/vddl/issues/16" TITLE : make use of vue events BODY : hello, vddl callbacks are a bit tricky because when defined, they are substitued to standard vddl code. the developer is then forced to handle items/lists stuffs splices etc... . it would be very useful to have events to listen to list changes without having to worry about lists splices handling. vue makes it very easy to add events. this could help us to process tasks after something happened item has been added to a list, redordering, etc... . thanks for your attention
