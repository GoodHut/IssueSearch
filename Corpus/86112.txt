 URL : "https://github.com/twtiger/gosecco/issues/51" TITLE : gosecco.load safe to use? BODY : there is one possible circumstance where we want to load a seccomp filter without setting no_new_privs at the same time because we are sure that it will be set very shortly thereafter and nnp gets in the way of something that needs to happen in between. we could use the exported load function for this, but i noticed that gosecco.load doesn't lock the golang thread as install does before it calls load .. is this intended? haven't tried calling load directly myself yet.
