 URL : "https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc/issues/1469" TITLE : mixing in to a constructor BODY : i'd like to document a constructor with static methods which are mixed in from a module. the final example on the mixes documentation http://usejsdoc.org/tags-mixes.html demonstrates how that tag assumes you are mixing in to a prototype, and the project maintains a test that asserts this behavior https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc/blob/15b57e52f37d12dd059266c06702c830c0192191/test/specs/documentation/mixins.js l44-l50 . back in 2010, there was some mailing list discussion about an into qualifier for the mixin tag https://groups.google.com/forum/ !searchin/jsdoc-users/mixin$20static%7csort:date/jsdoc-users/tq_1o8alq3o/2v6gnsaaoqej , but it doesn't seem like that ever materialized. is it possible to express this relationship with jsdoc today?
