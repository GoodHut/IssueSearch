 URL : "https://github.com/sqlalchemy-redshift/sqlalchemy-redshift/issues/115" TITLE : advertise for maintainers BODY : had a discussion with @graingert that he's no longer using redshift, so likely won't be able to be active in owning and maintaining this project. i'm still using redshift and can be involved, but probably can't give the project the attention it deserves without help. i propose we advertise for a new maintainer. a proposed path forward: - update readme with a call to action at the top indicating that we're looking for a maintainer - leave comments on all open issues indicating that we're looking for a new maintainer - @graingert grants rights on pypi to let @jklukas upload new releases if we get someone interested in being maintainer, then we'd proceed with making sure they also have rights on pypi, and we can update metadata in setup.py as appropriate. how does the above sound, @graingert ?
