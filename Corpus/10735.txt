 URL : "https://github.com/kencochrane/django-defender/issues/85" TITLE : defender for api BODY : hi, i'd like to use the package for protecting a login api url, the internals should be adjusted a bit like checking against 401 instead of 302 but i think passing an argument to the decorator should make it possible. also i'd really love to add the message on failed request to the db as a celery task. @kencochrane thoughts? if you think it's ok i could work on making this happen
