 URL : "https://github.com/donmelton/video_transcoding/issues/138" TITLE : detect crop output and zsh BODY : it looks like the new output from detect-crop outputs commands which need more escaping to work with the zsh shell. example: mpv --no-audio --vf lavfi= drawbox=0:140:1920:798:invert:1 hell\ or\ high\ water.mkv fails with zsh: no matches found: lavfi= drawbox=0:140:1920:798:invert:1 i think the command should actually be: mpv --no-audio --vf lavfi=\ drawbox=0:140:1920:798:invert:1\ hell\ or\ high\ water.mkv for it to work correctly with zsh. i think this kind of escaping still works with bash as well. i'm not really an expert on shell scripting though so i'm not sure if this is the best solution or not.
