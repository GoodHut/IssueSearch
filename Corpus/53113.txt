 URL : "https://github.com/flugger/laravel-responder/issues/33" TITLE : deeply nested includes BODY : i don't know if its a bug or if i am not doing it well, but i have a 3-level deep model relationship, i.e., survey that has many items which, in turn, have many results . i want to respond with nested information about the 3 levels, having 'items' and 'results' methods in 'surveytransformer' and 'itemtransformer', respectively, but doing things like... ...new surveytransformer ->include 'items.results' -> respond ; or ...new surveytransformer ->include 'items', 'results' -> respond ; my tries so far does not seem to work... can you please point me in the right direction? thank you very much in advance.
