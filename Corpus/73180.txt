 URL : "https://github.com/pma/amqp/issues/56" TITLE : connection not monitored BODY : hi, more than an issue this is a question! i was wondering why the connection.pid is not monitored. we had the genserver dying on us because of a dropped heartbeat and couldn't understand what was happening until we read the comment in the source code. if it's a matter of putting some time to harden the code against a missed heartbeat let me know, i'd be happy to help.
