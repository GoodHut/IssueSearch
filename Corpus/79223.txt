 URL : "https://github.com/rbeezer/mathbook/issues/541" TITLE : sbsgroup and subcaptions BODY : an sbsgroup with a caption , where there is a sidebyside with a figure that also has a caption , causes the latex to not compile. the issue is that the inner figure uses \subcaption , but the subcaption package has not been loaded because the usual trigger is when the parent sidebyside has a caption . there is no provision for when the grandparent sbsgroup has a caption .
