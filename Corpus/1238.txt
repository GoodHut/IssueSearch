BODY : hello, i'm trying to add a method to display a list of selectable texture in a window with imagebuttons. but when there are more than 125 buttons in the window, buttons with an index > 125 don't react to the click. i tried to use a withid index to make sure they have a different id but it doesn't change anything. thanks to you, catvert. ! sans titre https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8643204/33240211-bed8db3c-d2b2-11e7-85f0-a1c304e09891.png
