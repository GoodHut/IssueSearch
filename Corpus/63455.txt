 URL : "https://github.com/drupaldiversity/administration/issues/36" TITLE : drupalcon booth funding BODY : making a new issue for this as it's slightly separate from the booth setup itself and that issue is getting old. here is the pdf: ddidrupalconfundingproposal.pdf https://github.com/drupaldiversity/administration/files/876667/ddidrupalconfundingproposal.pdf do we want to target certain companies? tweet it at will? send it to our employers and friends? i think we should probably ask that if we approach any companies directly, that those be listed here so that we don't approach them twice. i also recall someone mentioning that camps were interested in giving, i'll try to dig back and see who that was.
