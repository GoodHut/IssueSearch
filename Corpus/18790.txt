 URL : "https://github.com/httpswift/swifter/issues/276" TITLE : update to swift 4 BODY : hey, the current swifter version is not optimized for swift 4; when building my xcode project, i get 19 warnings and 3 errors related to the swifter framework, f.ex. 'characters' is deprecated: please use string or substring directly. the three errors: all within scopes.swift : scope : missing argument parameter 1 in call c : missing argument parameter 1 in call output = output + mergedattributes.reduce {... contextual closure type ' _, _ -> _' expects 2 arguments, but 1 was used in closure body. is there any fix or something i could do in order to make swifter work? thanks a lot for help in advance!
