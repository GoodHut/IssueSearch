 URL : "https://github.com/avplayer/avhtml/issues/9" TITLE : closing comments handling BODY : i found a corner case, in which closing comments are not handled correctly. i.e. <!-->comment<!--> the end of the comment is marked by the second <!--> , but accidentally everything afterwards will be treated as comment also. the following snippet demonstrates the problem output is empty instead of hello world : html::dom page; page.append_partial_html <!-->comment<!--><html><head><title>hello world</title></head><body></body></html> ; std::cout << page title .to_plain_text << std::endl;
