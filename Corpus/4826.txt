 URL : "https://github.com/NathanWalker/nativescript-loading-indicator/issues/37" TITLE : height & width BODY : any chance of adding the height & width as additional options for ios? you can add this to the show method... this._hud.minsize = cgsizemake width option , height option ; this allows for a more consistent size throughout the app regardless of the 'details' message. thanks!
