 URL : "https://github.com/vinszent/gnome-twitch/issues/266" TITLE : translations for 0.4.1 BODY : @pfent @hmsintrepide @piotrdrag @generator @kostich @riflex @generator @sunderland93 @cyberstar1 @kordianbruck @radek-sprta time for another release with new translations! hopefully it shouldn't be too much but to make things easier i've setup a zanata project here https://translate.zanata.org/project/view/gnome-twitch/master and imported all existing translations including the spanish one @eljava and @alejandroc90 . i encourage that you use zanata, either via the web editor or command line, but you can still send me pull requests and i'll handle it. there's a short startup guide for zanata here http://docs.zanata.org/en/release/user-guide/translator-guide/ if you haven't used it before. if there are any problems, just let me know.
