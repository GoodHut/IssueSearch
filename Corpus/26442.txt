 URL : "https://github.com/chrjguill/i3lock-color/issues/52" TITLE : autotools is broken BODY : upstream moved to use autotools in ef4f9e40570d020571d277bde5703e32b126b9e4. not too bad, but: blur stuff is broken address sanitizer doesn't like it, at least i haven't been able to get it to compile a non-address-sanitizing build yet when i try to, it's apparently still inserting the address sanitization hooks, but jk lol no it's no this'll require a lot of work :v
