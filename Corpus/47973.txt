 URL : "https://github.com/ream/ream/issues/43" TITLE : ream config is broken BODY : my app was working fine in version v1.0.0-beta.9 but with any later version it is very broken. yes, i've made the changes for vue 2.3. after a lot of hunting i've narrowed down the problem to ream's config. if pretty much anything is placed in the config the app stops working. i've made a small app to demonstrate. you'll notice that the router doesn't work at all. https://github.com/jazoom/ream-minimal however, if you change: const app = ream { dev: process.env.node_env !== 'production', html: { template: 'src/index.html' }, entry: 'src/index.js' } ; to: const app = ream { dev: process.env.node_env !== 'production' } ; it works just fine. it also doesn't work if the only thing in there is my extensions to webpack config. actually, while i said it works fine without the config, in this minimal example for some reason the app is still broken due to a mismatch between server and client. i can't see where that's coming from in this example perhaps another bug , but i don't have that problem in my actual full project.
