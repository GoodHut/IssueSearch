 URL : "https://github.com/projectstorm/react-diagrams/issues/21" TITLE : usage with jsx BODY : the demos create everything on window.onload and render directly to document.body . the closest thing i could find was adventure-weave's index.tsx https://github.com/mwozniczak/adventure-weave/blob/master/src/index.tsx which returns a diagramwidget on its render , but that's just a wrapper and the actual work is also done during window.onload . in my case that wouldn't really work - i already have a full app with redux, routing, other pages so the diagram would not be always visible , etc. the ideal way would be for diagramwidget to be wrapped by a component that abstracts all that, i guess. i realize you guys are not fans of jsx, but many people don't really have an option there : - plus the default way to start learning react usually uses jsx. is there an example about linking it? what would be the best way to do it?
