 URL : "https://github.com/jiangcici/EC601-Smart-Wardrobe/issues/12" TITLE : yujia wang code reveiw 2 BODY : read me: the read me file seems hasn't been uploaded this time. but i followed the read me instructions and tried to import the code. detail comment : the comment was not as much as i expected. app design: since i cannot get to know what every line in the code exactly means. and when i run the code, it turns up to an error said that no such module 'keychainswift' . and it seems like a module has been lost. i don't know what is wrong with the code. so this needs more explanation. although the code last time is good, with quite great matching functions. it is not quite satisfying this time. so keep going with the sprints.
