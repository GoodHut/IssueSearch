 URL : "https://github.com/Thricehappy/EveScoutRescue/issues/40" TITLE : rework config file lookup BODY : the config file location lookupis somehow ugly. different locations and file names based on system name and type. the same filename/location for all system would be easiert to document. another option is a fallback to a default filename/location combination if no other configuration file is found.
