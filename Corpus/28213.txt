 URL : "https://github.com/BrendonEarl/uvic-space/issues/1" TITLE : fix cat positioning BODY : upon user click, a cat gif should be placed centred about the mouse cursor. currently, settimeout is used to delay accessing the cat's dom node so that it's width & height properties can be accessed. however, this is poor form, and the time taken for the node to be inserted into the dom varies by time and device, so this feature is not consistent. instead, js should wait until the node has been loaded into the dom before getting it's width & height to calculate it's position.
