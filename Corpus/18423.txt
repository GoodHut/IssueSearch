 URL : "https://github.com/NREL/openstudio-geometry-editor/issues/94" TITLE : tape measure tool BODY : would like a tape measure tool that can measure the distance between points and lines. user should be able to click a starting point then select an ending point either on a grid point, vertex, line segment, etc and measure the distance between. ideally the measurement would stay on the screen so users could take a screenshot as shown below.
