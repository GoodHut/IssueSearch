 URL : "https://github.com/caiogondim/logdown.js/issues/94" TITLE : switching to typescript BODY : one of the reasons why i chose logdown was that it has type definitions which makes it a great choice when using typescript. with logdown v3 the type definitions got removed and thus this project is not very user-friendly for typescript developers. because i â™¥ typescript i suggest to upgrade the logdown code base to typescript. it's not much code that needs to get translated and i can help with it. ðŸ˜ƒ typescript was already an option when planning the logdown rewrite https://github.com/caiogondim/logdown.js/issues/72 , so it's a great time to bring up that topic again. wdyt?
