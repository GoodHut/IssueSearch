 URL : "https://github.com/yusukeshibata/react-pullrefresh/issues/16" TITLE : refresh is called twice BODY : hello, i just noticed when i pull to refresh my refresh method is called twice. demo: ! refresh-twice https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16353378/25182254/0656937a-24e2-11e7-9d1a-fea25a133c80.gif you can see 2 console messages instead of the expected one. this is an issue for me because i'm doing a network call to refresh my page and i do not want to call it twice. i can probably workaround the issue with a horrible hack but i would like to avoid that. relevant code: // this is my onrefresh method handlerefresh next { console.warn handlerefresh next ; } this is how i declared the component: <pullrefresh zindex={10000} size={40} max={100} onrefresh={this.handlerefresh}> <div style={{ overflow: 'auto', height: '100%', width: '100%' }}> there are many variations of passages of lorem ipsum available ... </div> </pullrefresh>
