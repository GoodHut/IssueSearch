 URL : "https://github.com/elm-lang/core/issues/885" TITLE : text overflow in docs BODY : a long description like http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/platform program overflows in the toc on the right side, apparently because of the css .docs-annotation { white-space: pre; if we remove white-space: pre; the text stays in its container. should the .docs-annotation white-space: pre; be removed?
