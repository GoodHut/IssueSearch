 URL : "https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs/issues/11025" TITLE : d3.js v4 modules and cdnjs BODY : currently, we use the entire d3 v4 https://cdnjs.com/libraries/d3 . we don't use a lot of its features and i would like to use some of its modules instead and use your cdn big thanks for it! . i would like to send a pr, which adds d3.js v4 modules to cdnjs. before doing that, i would like to know why nobody has ever done that before. my gut feeling tells me there's some other way of doing what i want, so that's why i decided to create this issue before doing the actual work. so, the question is, does it make sense to add the modules, should i proceed with that? i apologise if this question was asked before.
