 URL : "https://github.com/luberda-molinet/FFImageLoading/issues/598" TITLE : cannot load stream on ios BODY : i am trying to load a byte array into a stream and then into a cachedimage with something like this: cachedimage img = new cachedimage ; img.source = imagesource.fromstream => new memorystream imagedata ; i get an image loading failed nullreferenceexception in my log. this works perfectly well on android but no on ios. i can also load images this way if i use the build in image from xamarin forms on both ios and android. btw. it also does not work to load embeddedresources into a stream and then into cachedimage . as always great work though!
