BODY : hey there julian, a family member of mine is an als patient and she's having a hard time coping with the keyboard elderly lady to communicate properly. i was thinking it would be much simpler for people in her case to have keyboard blocks to communicate with perhaps a new communication mode from the menu - whereas for instance there are initially 6 blocks on the screen, each containing letters. the user picks the block that contains their letter, and then that block is further dissected recursively until there are large blocks each containing a single letter emphasis on large blocks as she struggles with focusing on the smaller blocks there is a video on youtube here that contains a similar functionality, whereas you slowly zoom into the desired letter: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltscemhpiwk only simple letter blocks would be needed. she finds more detailed menus very confusing, and i imagine could potentially be the same for some others her age. otherwise, does optikey already have this feature and i've potentially missed it? thank you so much, joey
