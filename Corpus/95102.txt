 URL : "https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim/issues/520" TITLE : coretext garbles ligatures BODY : snapshot 134, macligatures is enabled. the font i am using is pragmatapro. it's hard to describe what i am experiencing, so let's have a look at two gifs. here is entering !== without coretext: ! not_coretext https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/344777/27882373-b9a4a922-61cc-11e7-8bb2-789045a799d4.gif as you can see, everything looks fine. here is the same with coretext enabled: ! coretext https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/344777/27882392-c86ce280-61cc-11e7-9fb3-d2c4ea095c34.gif as you can see, something is quite off here. the ligature gets broken somehow during working on the line. however, when changing the line, everything looks normal. obviously, disabling coretext is a perfect workaround, but since scrolling performance is somewhat horrible, i'd love to know if there is anything anyone can do here to resolve this rendering weirdness.
