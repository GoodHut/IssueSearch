 URL : "https://github.com/Graffino/Clear-Floats-Button/issues/6" TITLE : use br instead of div BODY : https://wordpress.org/support/topic/use-br-instead-of-div-element/ hey, thanks for your plugin. do you see a chance to make it configurable either to use “br” or “div” as element which get the clearing? my use case is that a “br” can be inside a “p” paragraph and clar a floating image there. a “div” will get shifted to “a new line” in the editor and therefore does not clear the floating image inside the “p” element. thanks
