 URL : "https://github.com/uhlryk/horpax/issues/30" TITLE : introduce store manager BODY : we can have multiple stores. store is target for saving data. it can be mongo database. postgres database, or file or outside service or api. instead passing everywhere one store we will pass store manager. and action or model will decide where to save. furthermore we will be able to create local storage only for one action request and don't store it globally in store manager
