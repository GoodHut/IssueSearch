 URL : "https://github.com/patrickelectric/bluerov_ros_playground/issues/11" TITLE : add light in bluerov2 BODY : light in robots appear to be possible since the beginning of this year with gazebo7. the pr that add this functionality can be seen here https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issues/900/allow-attachment-of-lights-to-links . it was not possible to add the lights in the actual model, need more research to solve this problem. it appear that the light need to be declared in <world> to be used in <robot>, but this is only a speculation.
