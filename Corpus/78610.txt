 URL : "https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/microcomponent/issues/25" TITLE : question: state vs props BODY : hi, i am curious to what the distinction is between state and props and when to use them. am i assuming correctly that props are for external use and state for internal? i think that the example in readme needs to be updated as the props from microcomponent constructor returns undefined in the render function. i might be totally off here, just thinking out loud ðŸ™ƒ
