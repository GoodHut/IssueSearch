 URL : "https://github.com/oncomouse/jquery-inline-footnotes/issues/1" TITLE : affecting other scripts BODY : hello, first of all, thank you so much for this amazing plugin. it's working great, except for one thing: i have these scripts that take care of focal and image ratios basically center the images in a container depending on some back-end choices; these containers are not even in <p> tags, they are in other div of my document . _inlinefootnotes_ breaks these scripts when the images have not been cached yet either the image container is blank or the image is stretched . the best example is on firefox. here is a example page : http://new.aware-art.org/magazine/test/ is there anyway for your script to affect only a certain id or class? something like: $ document .ready function { $ ' footnotes' .inlinefootnotes ; } ; thanks for the help! best.
