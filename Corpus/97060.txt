 URL : "https://github.com/opentrials/opentrials/issues/780" TITLE : fix gsk start_date parsing BODY : our code expects the start_date to be like february 06, 2017 , but some trials use abbreviated month names. | start_date | url | | --- | --- | | feb 06, 2017 | https://www.gsk-clinicalstudyregister.com/study/100006 | | jan 13, 2017 | https://www.gsk-clinicalstudyregister.com/study/100136 | the longer-term fix is not to parse this on the collectors level, but on the processors. however, there aren't many different date formats only 21 trials had this issue , so we can keep parsing it on the collectors. the nct collector has a similar pattern, where we accept more than one date format see https://github.com/opentrials/collectors/blob/c2fe87f1f565527fa60ec32dddd503b2599e1acd/collectors/nct/record.py l42-l46 . we should do the same here. tasks - change first_received , last_updated and record_verification_date fields to accept both %b %d, %y and %b %d, %y - add a test where it correctly parses one of the example records
