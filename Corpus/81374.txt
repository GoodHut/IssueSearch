BODY : hey there, i was looking to help develop the source code for the server. but i cannot start up the server because the world database that you guys supplied on github is completely empty? i would understand why characters + realmd would be empty for privacy reasons. but the world database data is literally needed to run the server. i was wondering if you guys could upload the full world database?
