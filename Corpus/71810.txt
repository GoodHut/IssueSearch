 URL : "https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/issues/3066" TITLE : all cudnn scores are nan BODY : possibly related to https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/issues/3064 i've also tried enabling double precision to see if the issue is related to underflow from center loss. however, nans persisted. i suspect my model configuration has surfaced an issue with our cudnn binding that was not detected in tests. @raver119 @saudet thoughts?
