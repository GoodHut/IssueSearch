 URL : "https://github.com/OpenSpaceOrg/openspaceorg.github.io/issues/2" TITLE : add a homescreen icon BODY : currently if i add the page to the homescreen an ugly screenshot is used as an icon. it would be better to use a real icon. as described on https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/appleapplications/reference/safariwebcontent/configuringwebapplications/configuringwebapplications.html //apple_ref/doc/uid/tp40002051-ch3-sw4 and http://www.selfhtml5.org/2012-apps-programmieren/7-ein-icon-fur-den-homescreen-web-clip-icon/ this probably only needs a link tag added to the page.
