 URL : "https://github.com/wix/wix-node-build/issues/69" TITLE : issue with node-sass BODY : hi, since this pr https://github.com/wix/wix-node-build/pull/67/files 2 of my build broke: http://ci.dev.wix/viewlog.html?buildid=27506989&buildtypeid=wixconnect_wixanswers_accountaccesstroubleshooter&tab=buildlog the reason is with node-sass version that doesn't support a method i use for namespacing classes. on node-sass 4.5.0, this works well another project.., non wix-node-build . possible solutions: - upgrade to 4.5.0 here - consider local installed node-sass if available - allow version to be overridden some other way
