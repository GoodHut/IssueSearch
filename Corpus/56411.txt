 URL : "https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/483" TITLE : name conflict of false BODY : if i include <x11/xlib.h> before format.h , compile will complain: ../../src/contrib/fmt/format.h:1209:8: error: expected identifier before numeric constant struct false { enum { value = 0 }; }; but if i exchange the include order, everything will be fine. it seems that <x11/xlib.h> has defined false as value 0. is name false too common to be a type identifier in header file.
