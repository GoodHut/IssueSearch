 URL : "https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/3d-tiles-tools/issues/98" TITLE : validator - validate glb BODY : @rudraksha20 after the small tileset.json fixes are squared away we will work on validating the gltf models that are embedded within b3dm and i3dm tiles. this will be a multi-part issue that we'll add on to as we go. check that the embedded glb is version 2.0. if not throw an error message. check that the glb meets the gltf 2.0 schema. we'll need to use the gltf validator https://github.com/khronosgroup/gltf-validator here, probably the dev branch. most likely the gltf validator will need to be called via a child process.
