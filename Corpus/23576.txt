 URL : "https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/PageManager/issues/33" TITLE : proposal sidebars? BODY : i was curious if there was some interest/want on the option of a sidebar for pages, i was thinking similar to how page templates are used but instead of a whole new sidebartemplates file, just add a new folder pages\sidebars and scan the directory. because there generally shouldn't be much content dynamically being made in those from what i can think of save a step of editing that file and more bloat. thoughts/feedkback?
