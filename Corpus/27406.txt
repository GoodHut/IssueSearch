 URL : "https://github.com/mavlink/qgroundcontrol/issues/4475" TITLE : custom widget value BODY : i've build mavlink for a custom message, following your tutorial everything works well. now i would read that value using a gauge in a widget. i've edited a exsiting qml dashboard and i have loaded through custom command loading widget with no problem. the last step is to read mavlink message and transfer value to widget. in my qml file there is the value: parameter setting it to a fixed value the qgrondcontrol widget indicates correctly, how can i set qml to read the value from mavlink. thanks
