 URL : "https://github.com/PCMDI/pcmdi.github.io/issues/194" TITLE : links to dynamic pages BODY : concerning this page: https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/ipcc/subproject_publications.html i believe this is the largest source of broken links on the site. there are about 1200 rows in this html table and almost all of them point toward 1 of 2 dynamic pages. for reference here are two example pages on the old site: https://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/ipcc/abstract.php?ipcc_publication_id=466&r=subprojects https://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/ipcc/project_detail.php?ipcc_subproject_id=1146 due to the fact that there is no publication information on the page, i cant just do a find and replace. all of the information about the publications is held in a database. @durack1, @taylor13 thoughts?
