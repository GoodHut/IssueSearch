 URL : "https://github.com/ractivejs/ractive/issues/2823" TITLE : ractive web widgets BODY : hi, i've got a little time on my hands, and thought about making a wrapper about some web widgets library. what i had in mind are rich widgets like datagrids, trees, tabs, datepickers... instead of reinventing the wheel, i'd like to wrap some existing library. the difficulty in that choice lies into selecting the which one, as there are many of those without clear cut winner. these are the ones i investigated: - dhtmlx: is a write the ui in js framework, doesn't integrate well inside other html. - dojo/dijit: i found it difficult to get into - easyui: declarative api makes it probably easy to integrate. nicely customizable. not on par feature wise with other libs keyboard navigation, multi row selections... - jquery ui: it's a possibility, but you'd have to deal with a lot of separate plugins since the core is tiny - jqwidgets: extremely nice examples, api slightly complex imho regarding remote data handling and customization, lots of widgets, but still lacking some like drag-drop uploads. - kendo ui: the open source core lacks everything, commercial licenses are expensive. - primeui: i think not everything is documented and more could be taken out of it ...but it's hard to say. - vaadin: not even a tree in the standard components?! - wijmo: hmmm... not a fan - yui: lacking imho - webix: is a write the ui in js framework, doesn't integrate well inside other html. --- as a conclusion, i'd pick one of: - easyui - jqwidgets - primeui easyui the easiest to port and customize. jqwidgets has most features/documention, and primeui has a nice license apache . --- do you have any preference as to which iu lib you'd really like to see ported to ractive? mentionned or not
