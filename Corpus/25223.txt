 URL : "https://github.com/dotsam/homebridge-milight/issues/13" TITLE : wall switch option BODY : hello dotsam. i found you code some weeks ago and it is working so nice that i started thinking in newer possibilities, but i am really new working with homebrigde. i was thinking about making an additional command when turning the lights on and off the milights to drive a relay powered by an esp8266 through http, this way we could better control the on/off state through home app, because without it the wall switch must be always on. as i have several traditional bulbs in my room, along with the milights, i already have an esp8266 working as a smart switch. do you have any idea if this is something difficult to implement? i will do some tests and try to make it work... thanks for the nice plugin you developed.
