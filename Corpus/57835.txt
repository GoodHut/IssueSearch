 URL : "https://github.com/Xiaoye220/EmptyDataSet-Swift/issues/5" TITLE : remove tableview lines BODY : is it possible to remove the table view lines by your framework? currently the label is renderd on top of the empty tableview. i would prefer a setting where your framework would hide the empty tableview. perhaps you already have this option but i couldn't find it. thanks <img width= 368 alt= bildschirmfoto 2017-12-14 um 08 34 53 src= https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2361031/33980630-03c8ad8a-e0aa-11e7-80c9-510c7b5e2d51.png >
