 URL : "https://github.com/mike-north/pwa-fundamentals/issues/47" TITLE : can't even install BODY : the support given for installing this is very crappy first: the tutorial mentions a file : server/cli/cli.js which doesn't exist ??? which branch should we choose in order to follow your tutorials properly ? some branches have a server/cli folder, some don't ? after installing all dependencies with yarn, i installed the certificates thanks for mentioning to win 10 users they have to get openssl in their path ? , everything finally went well, i then ran npm run watch and there's some error in js mentinoning there's no api and ui, at the end of the day i went to learn about service workers and i finally wasted my time with little to no support to install your project. so i'm stuck what do i do now ? so could you please give at least some recommendation for windows 10 users like me to install your app with clear and actually tested instructions, the ones you gave either on fem or on your readme don't work, for instance why do i always stumble upon errors in your javascript files preventing me to launch the app in any cases ?
