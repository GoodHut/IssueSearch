 URL : "https://github.com/Unitech/pm2/issues/2958" TITLE : can't remove cron_restart BODY : what's going wrong? i cannot seem to be able to remove/cancel a cron_restart property. how could we reproduce this issue? i have a processes.json as follow { script : app.js , args : start-server , name : myapp , exec_mode : cluster , instances : max , watch : false, cron_restart : /5 , env : { node_env : production } } if i change cron_restart to another value like /10 and run pm2 reload processes.json --update-env --only myapp pm2 save the cron pattern is updated as expected in /.pm2/dump.pm2 and the restart happen as expected. if now i remove the cron_restart property from the processes.json file, and redo, pm2 reload processes.json --update-env --only myapp pm2 save the cron_restart property is still present in /.pm2/dump.pm2 and the app will restart. supporting information pm2 version: 2.4.6 node version: 6.10.3 linux my current workaround is to pm2 delete myapp and pm2 reload processes.json --update-env --only myapp
