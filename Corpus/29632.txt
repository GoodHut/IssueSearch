 URL : "https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/OpenDroneMap/issues/562" TITLE : memory leak? docker BODY : ok, i understand this might be a common issue, but here it goes: i just run odm with a set of 99 images and using all default parameters, except for --force-ccd 6.17 phantom 4 camera . it took 40min and the results are good. memory usage was at about 3gib for depthmaps and went up to 12gib for depthmaps cleaning docker has 20 gib allocated to it after that, i tried to tweak some of the parameters: time docker run -it --rm \ -v $img_dir:/code/images \ -v $ pwd /odm_georeferencing:/code/odm_georeferencing \ -v $ pwd /odm_orthophoto:/code/odm_orthophoto \ -v $ pwd /odm_texturing:/code/odm_texturing \ -v $ pwd /odm_meshing:/code/odm_meshing \ -v $ pwd /odm_georeferencing:/code/odm_georeferencing \ -v $ pwd /opensfm:/code/opensfm \ opendronemap/opendronemap \ --force-ccd 6.17 \ --resize-to 4000 \ --min-num-features 10000 \ --mesh-size 2500000 \ --mesh-octree-depth 11 \ --mesh-solver-divide 11 \ --matcher-neighbors 8 \ --matcher-distance 0 \ --opensfm-processes 16 \ --gcp curralinho.gcps --time \ this time, i saw the memory usage going from 12gib for hahog to 19.5 for depthmaps. then block/io started to increase from 40-50mb up to 10gib and then it just stoped cpu went to 0.5% . could it be a memory leak? any object that should've been garbage-collected but wasn't? i'm using the opendronemap/opendronemap docker image from docker hub. this seems to be the latest version, but not the devel one. is there an opendronemap-dev docker image?
