 URL : "https://github.com/NHSLeadership/moodle-theme_nightingale/issues/18" TITLE : rename theme references BODY : as per discussion with @jdbrew it was decided that we need a more generic, identifiable name for moodle theme that resonates with the wider world. so the outer gh folder would be renamed to moodle-theme_nightingale and the actual theme would be called theme_nightingale changing all references int he code.
