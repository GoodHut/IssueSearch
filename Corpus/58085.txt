 URL : "https://github.com/zutrinken/bleak/issues/44" TITLE : rss style not working. BODY : this xml file does not appear to have any style information associated with it. the document tree is shown below. <rss xmlns:dc= http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/ xmlns:content= http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/ xmlns:atom= http://www.w3.org/2005/atom xmlns:media= http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/ version= 2.0 > don't know why but when i look at that page in chrome or firefox this rss style is not working properly. maybe it's text/xml? but needs to be text/html?
