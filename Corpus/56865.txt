 URL : "https://github.com/matthiasmullie/minify/issues/168" TITLE : option to set root dir BODY : for instance, if i am running this as part of a caching system, i may pass it a number of css or js files in the format of: /css/file.css where / is not system root, but web-root, further, any @include statements in there would be relative to the file, as well as web-root perhaps an options to allow/dissallow importing files from below web-root as well . the system could first see if the path as an absolute path exists, if not, prepend web-root. if the file still does not exist, fail. if it does exist, depending on whether or not we allow importing below web-root, check to see if the path contains web-root and pass/fail depending. it would also be helpful if i could add compiled less code, and set it's relative directory. i believe i can do make the mod to allow that easily enough, but the importing of paths that contain /absolute/web/path. css|img i believe would still fail. thoughts?
