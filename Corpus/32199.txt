 URL : "https://github.com/gepd/Deviot/issues/100" TITLE : ui footer too noisy BODY : i think the footer is too noisy not sure i need constant access to static info like board type, serial port, deviot version , pio version when i am trying to just see column and line numbers. maybe make the footer env string variable or optional at least consider some tabbing or if sublime allows segments in footer, to make it easer to see line and cols
