 URL : "https://github.com/jarvisteach/appJar/issues/120" TITLE : update event model BODY : improve the way users register events at the moment, it's only possible to have one event loop, and the user has to manage how many times it gets called. would be nice to offer a better model: each event in its own loop each loop has its own delay each loop has its own number of repeats each loop repeats until the function returns true so, .registerevent function could have additional parameters: count - how many times to repeat the function defaults to infinite - none sleep - how long to sleep between function calls defaults to 1 second checkresult - keep repeating until the function returns true default to off becoming: .registerevent function, sleep=1, repeat=none. checkresult=false .setpolltime then becomes deprecated - but will adjust the default delay time above. also, some way to sleep for x amount of time. this could be provided as: .sleep time . it would wait the specified amount of time before returning control back to the calling function. but it won't block the main loop, so the ui will remain responsive.
