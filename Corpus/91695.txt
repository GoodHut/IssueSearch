 URL : "https://github.com/opengisch/TOMs/issues/22" TITLE : unique id for restriction BODY : to help people easily identify a particular restriction there is a need for a “readable” unique id. there are three ids in use: •	id created from sequence on save operation. this is unique for a table or restriction type, .e.g., bays, lines signs •	geometryid that prefixes a letter to the id to ensure that it is unique across all restriction types. this is the readable unique id. •	guid which is a global id used within restricitonsinproposal. this is used because there is a need to uniquely identify a restriction prior to a save operation. the value from the sequence is only provided once the save operation has occurred . it is stored but it is not easily read. in the last week, based on discussions, the sequence has been changed to be used in creating the geometryid directly, however, there is a need for the data to be made available to esri databases. although this is still something we are working on, it appears that esri requires a unique id of type int. this need to be confirmed . so it seems that there is a need to keep all three ... the action is to: - create a link within postgres between the id and the geometryid - confirm the id requirements for interacting with esri geodatabases
