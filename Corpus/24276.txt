 URL : "https://github.com/u-root/u-root/issues/424" TITLE : size flag handling BODY : currently we don't really have a nice way to handle size flags. i wrote some flags compatible lib for that. it needs some polishing and obviously tests, but it works pretty well, including showing the default on -h and so on. it was written with truncate in mind, so it also handles/exposes an explicitly given sign. https://github.com/rck/size/blob/master/size.go it would be used like this: var mapping size.mapping = size.mapping{ ... kib : 1024, .... } var flags = size.flag s , size.newsize 42, kib , mapping , parse size including unit i had a version that provides a default mapping , where the user just specified a filter like string{size.kib,...} , but then i saw the crazy dd size flags like 'c' and 'w' and decided that it is the callers responsibility to provide a full mapping. could be changed... so some questions: - do we want that/something similar? - if so, where would we put it? if there is some interest and you tell me where it should land, i would prepare a pr with it + tests and truncate as the first user. when that is in, i would then look where we can use it as well dd is an obvious candidate .
