 URL : "https://github.com/kamalmostafa/minimodem/issues/26" TITLE : noaa same codes BODY : i am generating and decoding noaa same sequences with minimodem on raspberry pi 3. minimodem decodes all right any live sequence that i generated with another instance of minimodem as well as any recorded one. however, when i tried to use a professional grade hardware same decoder on the sequences generated with minimodem , i got less than perfect results - the hw decoder recognizes about a half of the generated sequence. for example, the decoder reports just this: zczc-wxr-ffw-012011-012086-012099=99?8+, when i feed it with that: zczc-wxr-ffw-012011-012086-012099-012103+0015-1231545-wxyz/nws- it looks like the minimodem generates just half of the sequence right, and the second half is faulty. any ideas and help would be greatly appreciated.
