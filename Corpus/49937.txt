 URL : "https://github.com/nikku/karma-browserify/issues/209" TITLE : use global transforms BODY : hey everyone, thanks for this framework, it helped me making a huge step forward for my project quality. there's one thing that i can't find out how to configure: i have some transitive dependencies i don't require them, but my dependencies do , which have fs.readfilesync calls in them. so to get rid of them, i run brfs on it. in my package.json, my task looks as follows: build-js : browserify -g brfs src/js/webapiclient.js -s webapiclient -o publish/webapiclient.js , i have to use the -g flag for my transform, otherwise brfs would not be executed on my transitive dependencies. in my karma.conf.js i have the following browserify configuration right now: browserify: { debug: true, transform: 'brfs', istanbul { ignore: ' /node_modules/ ', ' /spec/ ' } } this however behaves just like the normal transform, so my transitive dependencies are not transformed like this. i read that you can pass browserify options just like the debug option above, but i did not succeed on doing this for the -g / --global-transform=module option. any help on this would be greatly appreciated. kind regards, florian
