 URL : "https://github.com/filestack/filestack-js/issues/82" TITLE : can't upgrade filestack-js BODY : it seems that you guys are fixing the picker-v3 version on your dist build files. i guess you should make it dynamic so we can upgrade the picker by ourselves when needed. for instance, there are several new version stuff that i'd like to use but i can't because your lib fixes the picker version to 0.12.3. thanks in advance!
