 URL : "https://github.com/UCI-UAVForge/Avionics/issues/106" TITLE : electronics housing design BODY : summary size hardware components that will be on uav and create a layout for them. terminal objectives - have a layout that illustrates where each hardware component is on the uav, given their dimensions and any constraints that may occur to guarantee functionality. enabling objectives - awaiting available area dimensions from mechanical design team. will have to work within this space and find a layout that does not affect performance. - upon providing the layout, will potentially need to meet with mechanical design to guide them through the layout and discuss any compromises if necessary.
