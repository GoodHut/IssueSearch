 URL : "https://github.com/btc1/bitcoin/issues/34" TITLE : anti-replay and anti-reorg BODY : @gavinandresen's anti-replay patch replay carries with it the benefit of preventing the 1mb chain from ever reorging the 2mb chain. as soon as an op_return segwit2x transaction is mined on the 1mb chain, the 1mb chain is now invalid in the eyes of the hf code. i think this should be implemented for both anti-replay and anti-reorg benefits. while gavin's anti-replay is probably the simplest, it's worth mentioning that @jl2012 also had a clever way of preventing replays on spoonnet: a special tx version bit enforces segwit-style sighashing for even non-segwit inputs a nice perf boost to boot , but this is a bit trickier, since it has a higher chance to invalidate existing pre-signed transactions, and requires more to implement in wallets especially hardware wallets . thoughts? replay : https://gist.github.com/gavinandresen/2a7474a3dd5b834ed3a7d10c74ec84c5
