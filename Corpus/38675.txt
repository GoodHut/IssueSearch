 URL : "https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/issues/6461" TITLE : pt-br language group BODY : i was reading some of the pt-br translations and some of them are... understable but others are strange or not friendly, i mean, some are just strict translation of the work or aportuguesamento of the word which is no too ok ? i think , so, could we make a group for translation or to discuss, by this i mean just chat no discuss like figth and stuff, to make the portuguese translations a little... cooler, or even better? what u think @esenapaj @jbrazio @hydrocat @ivan-galvez ?
