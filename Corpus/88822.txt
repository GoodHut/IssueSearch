 URL : "https://github.com/arthurbergmz/webpack-pwa-manifest/issues/19" TITLE : output name interpolation BODY : webpack along with many loaders and plugins allow specifying output filenames in interpolated formats such as name . ext and name . hash . ext , which are also used for configuration between development and production to toggle what this plugin has fingerprint option for. currently the naming of output icons is quite hardcoded: https://github.com/arthurbergmz/webpack-pwa-manifest/blob/383c65999fcfeb5e66321b294670d92c25ce5687/src/icons.js l33-l35 it would be great to have support for customizing the filename format using webpack standardized interpolated names, allowing the default format to be something like icon_ size x size . ext or icon_ size x size . hash . ext . note the custom size parameter. specifying a custom name format would probably have to override the default and also fingerprint option. a similar but separate interpolated format could probably exist for naming the manifest.json file, although it would not be as necessary as being able to name the icons. loader-utils interpolatename https://github.com/webpack/loader-utils interpolatename is what seems to be able to do the necessary translations.
