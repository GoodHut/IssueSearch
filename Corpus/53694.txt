 URL : "https://github.com/strathausen/dracula/issues/44" TITLE : error in documentation BODY : the documentation states that the settings of an edge must be passed in an object as the 3rd parameter of the addedge function. see the example below extracted from the website: / a directed connection, using an arrow / g.addedge id34 , cherry , { directed : true } ; / customize the colors of that edge / g.addedge id35 , apple , { stroke : bfa , fill : 56f , label : label } ; i couldn't get this to work. looking at the source code, i found out that every edge setting is retrieved from the parameter style , so i changed my approach to the following: g.addedge id34 , cherry , { style: {directed : true} } ; g.addedge id35 , apple , { style: {stroke : bfa , fill : 56f , label : label }} ; now it works fine. it would be great for new users if the docs could be updated.
