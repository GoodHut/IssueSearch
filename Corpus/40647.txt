 URL : "https://github.com/hapijs/lab/issues/715" TITLE : upgrade to eslint v4 BODY : that's right, eslint v4 is out! http://eslint.org/blog/2017/06/eslint-v4.0.0-released / http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/migrating-to-4.0.0 i assume lab will want to follow suit. the upgrade path doesn't look terribleâ€“ primarily some close reading to double-check nothing will break! i'm open to helping with this as time allows, provided lab does actually plan to upgrade in the near-term.
