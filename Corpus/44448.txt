 URL : "https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/345" TITLE : examples are outdated BODY : the examples in the aptly-named /examples directory are out of date, some extremely so. it appears that they're all micropython based these should be updated, replaced, or removed, and organized depending on what boards they run on. my preferences: - if it relies on specific hardware that there is no circuitpython board comparable to, remove it. - if its purpose is outside the scope of circuitpython, remove it. - if we can adapt it to a specific circuitpython board i'm looking at you, circuit playground , do so. - if it's an easy update, bring it into line with to-be-created guidelines.
