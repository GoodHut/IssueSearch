 URL : "https://github.com/mpc-hc/mpc-hc.org/issues/82" TITLE : we're not dead BODY : i'm aware that we don't have a new release since 1.7.13, but i think that this point it would be nice to include a simple message that we gotten some new developers, that work is getting done and that we're not going anywhere yet, at least . a lot of people, especially more casual users, would see that the program has apparently stopped development according to the website and abandon ship for whatever they could find --- these people are unlikely to be checking the github. i don't know if @xhmikosr you want to write it, but if not, i could. it could be as short as follows: > we're still here > due to a recent outpouring of volunteer developers from the community, mpc-hc will be sticking around for now. feel free to check out the latest goings-on at our github https://github.com/mpc-hc/mpc-hc . if you have experience in c/c++, we would also love if you could try your hand at contributing there. also, we should reopen donations if we're an active project, if that hasn't been done.
