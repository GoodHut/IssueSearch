 URL : "https://github.com/dokan-dev/dokan-dotnet/issues/131" TITLE : deletefile not working. BODY : the deletefile method is not called. the break point on this method in my code is never triggered. i also tested the mirror example. the one in this repo written in c can't delete files, but the one in the dokany repo written in c works. so i think it is related to this project, not dokany. os: windows 10 enterprise x64 build 10514 dokany version: 1.0.1.1000 dokan.net version: 1.1.0.1
