 URL : "https://github.com/links-lang/links/issues/179" TITLE : use websocket 2.8 for now BODY : for some reason possibly related to https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/issues/3000, or to recent changes in the build setup for websocket, or both , websocket.cohttp 2.9 won't install correctly for me on mac os x. i suggest that for the dalry release we peg the version of websocket used to be <= 2.8, unless there is 2.9 is strictly better in some way, in which case we should raise an issue on websocket pointing out the dependence on currently non-portable conf-gmp and zarith libraries.
