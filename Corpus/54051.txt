 URL : "https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper/issues/318" TITLE : feedback on casper 2.0 BODY : i really like the old casper theme so at first i was sceptic about new design but then i think it's best if i just give you my thought on how to make 2.0 better. so here it goes in random order subtitle is fine but title is missing title should be placed where ghost logo is now: ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5560454/27504096-a2a72d5e-5884-11e7-88bd-6f1488967cb6.png add some left margin to navbar items ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5560454/27504130-2649c0e0-5885-11e7-9e0f-c4c5cb0dd5b8.png move rss icon to footer ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5560454/27504138-49942db0-5885-11e7-956a-76179f8ca4d1.png add publication date to cards date could fit eg. below author. ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5560454/27504151-7e85d8de-5885-11e7-8a84-15e5b0cb940a.png btw. cards are really beautiful - well done get rid of top bar appearing in the middle of post seriously this bar is a disaster as it completely ruins the style of casper theme. my suggestion not to use any sliding bars and put social icons in static way somewhere where they won't look intrusive. ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5560454/27504213-0a082a9c-5886-11e7-8781-4d4e2f42defa.png
