 URL : "https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/liquidhaskell/issues/956" TITLE : question : inv_proof BODY : i see tutorial 12 needs inv_proof haskell {-@ invariant {v:avl a | 0 <= realheight v && realheight v = getheight v} @-} {-@ inv_proof :: t:avl a -> {v:_ | 0 <= realheight t && realheight t = getheight t } @-} inv_proof leaf = true inv_proof node k l r n = inv_proof l && inv_proof r this is another thing that is not introduced earlier. i think some sort of glossary of accepted liquid haskell annotations and their interpretation would be a good thing. perhaps split into core and experimental/deprecated.
