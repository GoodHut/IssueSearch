 URL : "https://github.com/rukai/vulkano-text/issues/1" TITLE : support depth in pipeline BODY : first of all thanks for the awesome addition to vulkano! i'm playing with vulkano and now vulkano-text to make a molecule viewer and i needed to patch the pipeline definition in vulkano-text since there must be a match between the pipeline used by vulkano-text and the one used by the caller. of course the change i did is awful since you would want to support any number of pipelines. maybe use a template for it? not sure what the right approach is, but would be glad to write a patch if you would suggest an avenue. https://github.com/alon/vulkano-text/commit/61659bb6521237077b3086b28c6dcd7aa2426c18 problem without patch: thread 'main' panicked at 'called result::unwrap on an err value: autocommandbufferbuildercontexterror incompatiblerenderpass ', /checkout/src/libcore/result.rs:906:4 s relevant part from the stack trace: 11: vulkano_text::drawtext::draw_text at /home/hiro/.cargo/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/vulkano_text-0.5.0/src/lib.rs:276 12: <vulkano::command_buffer::auto::autocommandbufferbuilder as vulkano_text::drawtexttrait>::draw_text at /home/hiro/.cargo/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/vulkano_text-0.5.0/src/lib.rs:293
