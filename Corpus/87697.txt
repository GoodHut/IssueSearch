 URL : "https://github.com/livecomsjournal/article_templates/issues/20" TITLE : make changes to templates BODY : this is a to-do list spinning off of discussion in 16 ; it will be updated as we get more discussion there. currently, i'm expecting we'll want to make at least these changes to the template: important: - setup checklists perhaps a custom checklist environment providing visually appealing checklist-like panels https://github.com/livecomsjournal/article_templates/issues/16 issuecomment-327872610 - date, doi and version in the left column of the first page - decide/add an official location for a link to the github repo left column of first page? probably nice to have: - sans serif math fonts to go with the sans serif text and in a final stage: - after all of the above are done, create templates for the other article types as in 9 - make custom changes for specific types of documents -- perhaps best practices documents should use more of the full width of the page https://github.com/livecomsjournal/article_templates/issues/16 issue-255951019 for body text and checklists - organize each template as appropriate for the type of document; e.g. best practices documents may need to explicitly note scope, etc., as noted here https://github.com/livecomsjournal/article_templates/issues/16 issue-255951019 .
