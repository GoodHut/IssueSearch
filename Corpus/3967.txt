 URL : "https://github.com/Screetsec/TheFatRat/issues/64" TITLE : a pull request BODY : i was unable to create the pull request from my git to yours because there are massive changes in my git that crashes my firefox when git is analyzing the differences . fatrat is originally your creation , so in good faith i believe that i should send you a pull request everytime some good changes are made . fatrat becomes fatrat 1.9beta and the changes are : - apk 5 rat rebuild totally changed . adapted backdoor-apk script to fatrat to both work together - apks have a new payload hiding method in rat apk to not be detected . - apktool will not be installed no more by setup.sh , the same thing applies to : dx , zipalign apktool on debian repo is 2.2.1 , and that version have a bug that gives error on compiling the apks , so , apktool and android tools were updated to latest version 25.0.2 and embeded in tools directory of fatrat . - some other changes were made but i can not remember everything now because i have been doing the changes since beginning of last week . the only way that i see for you to merge my git to yours is : -cloning my git to your hard disc -enter hidden directory .git in my git and change from : https://github.com/peterpt/thefatrat to https://github.com/screetsec/thefatrat and then over the terminal do a git push to your account , so all files can be changed . if you do not want to merge then there is no problem . anyway , here are the new changes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj7afebjvdq
