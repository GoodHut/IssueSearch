 URL : "https://github.com/ddspringle/framework-one-secure-auth/issues/5" TITLE : combine with 2fa example BODY : instead of having two distinct examples, it's feasible to include configuration options to determine if single or two factor authentication is desired for any particular application and implement each respectively. requires migrating 2fa specific functionality to this project, modifying them as required, adding a configuration option for single or two-factor auth selection and firing off appropriate views as needed. also requires an update to readme, and removal of the code in the 2fa project and redirecting users here in that readme.
