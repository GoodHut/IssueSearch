 URL : "https://github.com/sschmid/Entitas-CSharp/issues/379" TITLE : components and namespace BODY : i am checking v0.41 lately. after working a lot with v0.35, the new features are very welcome. i use namespaces as a convention. the problem is after generating components, the variable name for the component is the whole namespace combined with the component name. is it intended or am i doing something wrong? example: namespace name.space.test { public class testcomponent : icomponent { public int value; } } the generated name for this component is 'namespacetesttest'.
