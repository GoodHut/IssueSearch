 URL : "https://github.com/tseemann/snippy/issues/106" TITLE : allele numbering core vcf BODY : hi! i am writing a script to parse the snippy-core output and wonder if allele 2 or 3 could be the major allele in the snippy core vcf? or is it always 0 or 1? are they just numbered after the order in which they occur in the core genome parsing or after any kind of frequency? best wishes, kaisa
