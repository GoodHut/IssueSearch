 URL : "https://github.com/openhealthcare/opal/issues/970" TITLE : application menu items 2.0 BODY : although the menu items functionality has mostly served our needs thus far, recent projects have exposed a need for finer grained control over menu items. - don't hard-code lists - don't hard-code admin - don't hard-code logout - render menu items for applications and plugins together, via an application method - expose sort order for all by default currently it's impossible to interleave plugin and app menuitems - write documentation for the menuitems functionality this will likely be a breaking change that should target 0.9.0
