 URL : "https://github.com/Tricky1975/trickyunits_go/issues/16" TITLE : directory support jcr BODY : i've been planning for awhile to do this. at this moment jcr6 just stores files with pathnames, but technically speaking we can just speak of very long file names. as jcr6 was originally a resource format for games this was alright, but in order to make it also able to function as an archiver maybe support for this is in order a directory entry should contain - name with path - time stamp - unix permissions when using jcr6 in a go application or in games they will hardly play a role worth mentioning, if any role at all, but i guess when you try to use jcr as an archiver, well, then it may play a role i guess :p
