 URL : "https://github.com/LibreCAD/LibreCAD/issues/901" TITLE : current layer visibility BODY : i just noticed that you can hide a layer, but it still remains active as your current layer. this means that you can be drawing objects without being able to see them. i have done a search and have found references to this issue in versions prior to the active layer being displayed on the status bar, which would indicate that this issue might have received consideration and the decision was made to leave it as is? <!-- this is a comment, not shown in your issue. you can delete it or leave it as it is. please give your issue an useful title. and please enter as much information as possible into each paragraph below . think twice, post once ;- if your issue is about how to use librecad consider to ask in the forum http://forum.librecad.org/. the chances for fast help are much higher as there are much more user active, not only developer. --> expected behavior observed behavior steps to reproduce or sample file operating system and librecad version info
