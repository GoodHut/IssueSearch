 URL : "https://github.com/usgs/fort-pymdwizard/issues/23" TITLE : make larger work distinct. BODY : i have found that when i upload an existing xml template some of the data does not transfer over. for example, in the field “originator” for both the data set and larger work only one individual moves over even though i have several in the original xml. i also think that the larger work field names should be unique from those found in the data set. most often at our center the larger work is a manuscript and this gets lost because the title in the box see yellow highlighted box is the same box title as that found above in the dataset citation fields ! image https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/23191658/26698997/6148a718-46d5-11e7-95da-fda5c71f8949.png passed on by robin tillett
