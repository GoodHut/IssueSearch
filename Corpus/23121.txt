 URL : "https://github.com/infinitered/gluegun/issues/226" TITLE : node version 7.6.0 BODY : why pinning isnewenough to a version that's equal to or greater than 7.6.0 ? many people use the latest stable lts version of node in production, currently 6.11.3 . what about? 1. get https://nodejs.org/dist/ the latest lts version, and then use >= against it. 2. hardcode 6.11.3 instead of 7.6.0 and then regularly update whenever a new lts version is out. thoughts?
