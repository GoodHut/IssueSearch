 URL : "https://github.com/nieroda/mcafeeBTCTradeBot/issues/1" TITLE : follow filter issue BODY : i am fairly sure that i myself could tweet the following which would trigger a buy event '@officialmcafee coin of the day btc' this is because the follow action displays everything relating to the followed user. not sure if there is a better filter to only stream events fro =m the user id, otherwise you probably need to wrap the method in an if statement if !tweet.text.includes '@officialmcafee' { checktweet tweet.text ; }
