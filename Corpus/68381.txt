 URL : "https://github.com/gridcoin/Gridcoin-Research/issues/232" TITLE : revive and extend tests BODY : src/test contain a couple of unit tests inherited from the bitcoin source code. i'm not sure it's being built now so we should ensure that it is and can execute without failing. later on we can extend this suite with our own tests and integrated it in a continuous integration environment. the original tests use boost::test but i'm thinking we should switch to qtest even in the headless wallet. this would add a build dependency to qt but it would allow us to use one test tool for both the ui and the lowlevel code.
