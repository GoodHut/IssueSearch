 URL : "https://github.com/mkarpoff/vim8-pack/issues/1" TITLE : troubles on freebsd BODY : hi, i'm trying to run vim8-pack on freebsd and i'm having some trouble. first, /bin/bash is not present on freebsd and i think in all bsd, but i'm not sure . for instance, i have bash in /usr/local/bin/bash . i'm going to make a pr to achieve this issue just use /usr/bin/env bash instead, easy . last, here on freebsd getopt does not have --longoptions a simple man getopt | grep -i long doesn't find anything . i think that should be a gnu extension, although i've not checked yet.
