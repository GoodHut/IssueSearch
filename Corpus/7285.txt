BODY : hello all. thanks for doing such a great job on such a useful add-in. having used it for a couple of months i find that i can't go back to the old way! i have some message boxes in my code that i need to fake but i can't, for the life of me, find any docs on how to fake these. can you point me in the right direction or am i going to have to study the code to figure it out? thanks in advance!
