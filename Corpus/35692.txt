 URL : "https://github.com/Grunny/zap-cli/issues/33" TITLE : exclude certain urls BODY : hey , is there a way to exclude a url from the alerts or mark it as a false positive? what i've done so far is: - zap-cli exclude $url where $url is the complete url - zap-cli exclude $reg where $reg is a regex that matches the exact payload - zap-cli quick-scan -s xss -r -e $url $app - zap-cli quick-scan -s xss - r -e $reg $app unfortunately, none of those seems to work. i can't provide more details on which url i'm scanning since it is work related, but the payload that zap-cli outputs is: ?query=%3balert%281%29%3b which decoded is ?query=;alert 1 ; cheers, marvin
