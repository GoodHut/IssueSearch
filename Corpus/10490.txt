 URL : "https://github.com/PendragonGame/pendragon/issues/96" TITLE : clean up load ui BODY : @jacobbel used some pretty hacky and repetitive code to get the ui up and running. while it works, it is going to be a real pain to debug if we have any problems. @brianbad, please look into the load_meny.js file and see if you can trim the fat. remember, set @jacobbel as the reviewer for any pull request that follows.
