 URL : "https://github.com/ProfessorFrancken/ProfessorFrancken/issues/96" TITLE : some design stuff BODY : use smaller subtitles, i'd prefer h4 over h2 for certain blocks. i'd also prefer some less deep black. in general i think it's better to fade to gray a bit more. add .text-muted to some stuff . it would also be nice if you'd lose the 'hr' above/below the first and last element at lists like the board list. and some more white space under headers/titles. example provided below: ! temp5 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15364627/23279024/ffeeb33a-fa13-11e6-948b-450d7ac18af6.png
