 URL : "https://github.com/redhat-developer/s2i-dotnetcore/issues/89" TITLE : use of dotnet:latest tag BODY : i wonder if we should remove the dotnet:latest from our image streams. 1. latest can break builds. e.g. when latest moved from 1.0 to 1.1, all 1.0 using latest would break. versioning rules have been changed for .net core 2. now when latest moves from 2.x to 3.x things will break. 2. asides from us breaking the apps by moving latest, users need to use a version that is compatible with their .net core application. this isn't necessarily latest. so they know explicitly what version they'd like. note there is a use-case for 'latest 2x' as this allows users to stay on a supported compatible version. we can consider that when we do 2.1. feel free to give some feedback. if you are fine with removing latest, a thumbs up on the issue is enough. cc @omajid @jerboaa @aslicerh @bparees
