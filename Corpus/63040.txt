 URL : "https://github.com/yishn/Sabaki/issues/224" TITLE : dear userstyle creators BODY : with v0.31.0 sabaki will support themes see 213 ! for that reason, i have replaced the links to various userstyles in the documentation with a theme directory https://github.com/yishn/sabaki/blob/master/docs/guides/theme-directory.md . i would be thrilled to see you turn your userstyles into themes https://github.com/yishn/sabaki/blob/master/docs/guides/create-themes.md and resubmit them to the documentation via pull request. if you don't want to, that's also alright. sabaki still supports userstyles. there are some advantages to using themes over userstyles: you can display meta information to the user such as the theme name, description, author, homepage you can install multiple themes and change themes instantaneously without restarting sabaki ! screenshot https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9217349/26030030/9a20a278-3845-11e7-8555-d030e132c6d7.png
