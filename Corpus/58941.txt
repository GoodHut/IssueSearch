 URL : "https://github.com/altf4/libmelee/issues/6" TITLE : support sheik and ic's BODY : melee stores sheik and zelda as separate characters, both of which exist at all times. when you transform , you're actually not changing into sheik in terms of the game's data structures but rather zelda goes into an invisible and inactive state. it's just like nana/popo. libmelee currently doesn't even see sheik / nana, since we're only looking at one character. look into what it would take to see sheik / nana. it might be something as simple as an addition to locations.txt, or it might be complicated and require a dolphin patch
