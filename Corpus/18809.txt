 URL : "https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/28943" TITLE : updates to void . BODY : void will be updated in the following way: - in checked mode, void accepts any value. the old behavior only allowed null . https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/28935 - an arrow function declared with => is allowed to have expressions of any type if the return type is void . for example void foo => x++; . https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/28939 - void is allowed as a type argument to generics. the most common use cases are things like future<void> or visitor<void> . statically and dynamically, in dart 1, a generic void is treated similar to object , except for functions, where the old behavior is maintained. in particular, a void -function is not assignable to an int -function or any other non- void function . https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/27504
