 URL : "https://github.com/ForkIssues/Tracker/issues/72" TITLE : increased update time BODY : i just want to share my thoughts/experience there. i really dislike the recently increased update time caused by bundled git. waiting 1-2 minutes for an update really makes me mad. i don't even remember what new features i was going to check out. i consider long update time as a usability problem/bug and going to investigate the incremental update approach which should diminish the update size to 1-3 mb . this can be related to https://github.com/forkissues/tracker/issues/69
