 URL : "https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues/8309" TITLE : improve snow accessibility BODY : there are many arguments about the holiday snow script, see 1349. instead of getting into the remove/global disable/performance/etc arguments, here are some things we can do now. a useful step for screen readers would be to add aria-hidden= true and role= presentation attributes to the snowflake https://github.com/automattic/jetpack/blob/master/modules/holiday-snow/snowstorm.js l243 , so that the elements aren't added to the screen reader dom. another useful step is to disable it entirely with the prefers-reduced-motion media query https://css-tricks.com/introduction-reduced-motion-media-query/ . thanks to the magic of matchmedia , the snow script can bail early if this is true: window.matchmedia ' prefers-reduced-motion: reduce ' .matches . this media query currently only works in safari 10.1 macos and ios , though it is in the css draft process https://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries-5/ prefers-reduced-motion , so will likely be available in all browsers in the future.
