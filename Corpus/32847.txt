 URL : "https://github.com/patjak/bcwc_pcie/issues/109" TITLE : wrong white balance BODY : i'm running ubuntu 16.10 on the macbook pro 15 from mid-2015. for some reason, the webcam doesn't always display the correct white balance when using this driver. it works fine during the day in sunlight, but at night when i use artificial lighting everything has an orange tint. i've confirmed that auto-white-balance is enabled for the driver, yet the image still looks off. any support would be appreciated :
