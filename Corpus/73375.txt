 URL : "https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/1543" TITLE : create a namedview class BODY : create a new class: namedview that extends view. when running an operation users can then choose to either use a normal view or a namedview. to allow this to work via json we will need to configure the serialisation to allow the class name of the view to be used. this can be done using the jsontypeinfo annotation on this new class or on the view class. it is important that if a class is not provided in json the serialisation should default to assuming it is a view. subtask of 1542.
