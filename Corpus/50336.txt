 URL : "https://github.com/lxde/libqtxdg/issues/122" TITLE : wrong icons for sizes BODY : consider an icon theme whose icons are all svg and whose index contains these keys: ... places/16 size=16 context=places type=fixed places/22 size=22 context=places type=fixed places/scalable size=96 context=places type=scalable minsize=16 maxsize=512 ... with this arrangement, kde correctly shows the folder icon from places/scalable for folders â‰¥ 23px while lxqt gets the folder icon from places/16 for all sizes.
