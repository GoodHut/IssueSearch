 URL : "https://github.com/ZeroK-RTS/Zero-K-Infrastructure/issues/1851" TITLE : wrapper offline mode BODY : it should be possible to run zk without internet access. the wrapper should remember the engine version and zkmenu version that the server tells it to run chobby with. this should work out because the steam wrapper can come packaged with the correct stored versions and the non-steam wrapper must download things on its first run or it will not have anything to launch with. subsequent launches of the non-steam wrapper can use the remembered engine and chobby version if the internet is not found.
