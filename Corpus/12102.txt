 URL : "https://github.com/Wangscape/Wangscape/issues/187" TITLE : more new modules BODY : some more ideas for noise modules which may be useful but are expensive or impossible to simulate with existing modules. see 88 for details on procedure for adding new modules. pixellate : pixellates a source module by returning the source value at regularly spaced points. essentially p x,y,z = p.s floor x , floor y , floor z . should have frequency and offset parameters. mosaic : similar to pixellate, but using voronoi regions rather than cubic regions. ideally this would be derived from libnoise's voronoi module, but that module is not well-encapsulated and would have to be refactored see https://github.com/qknight/libnoise/blob/master/src/module/voronoi.cpp l37 . so, the options are to make an mit version of the algorithm or to fork libnoise. blur / convolve ?: evaluates the source module at several offset points and returns a weighted average of them. the user controls the offset and weight of each point, similar to control points in the curve module. ?
