 URL : "https://github.com/ncullen93/torchsample/issues/28" TITLE : python 2 compatibility BODY : great library, love it! some of the tools are not python 2 compatible. for instance randomchoicerotate and anything that uses util.th_random_choice does not work because in python 2 the round method returns a float, not an integer, and the below torch.zeros throws an exception. idx_vec = th.cat th.zeros round p i 1000 +i for i in range len p i can make a pull request to try to fix it if you like. i would advise running tests on both python 2 and 3 compilers.
