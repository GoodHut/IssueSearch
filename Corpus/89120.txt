 URL : "https://github.com/Vinsanity/Custom-User-Profile-Photo/issues/13" TITLE : plugin no longer works... BODY : wp version 4.8.2 website: https://ucxchange.staging.wpengine.com/blog/ if you inspect where the author image would go in chrome it prints ' unknown ' even though the photo exists in the admin in the edit profile section under custom avatar. i did find a workaround by inspecting your code for the admin section. the way you are displaying the image there is different from how you instruct users to display on the front end. i used your admin screen method and it works. <img src= <?php echo get_the_author_meta 'cupp_upload_meta', get_the_author_meta 'id' ; ?> width= 50 height= 50 />
