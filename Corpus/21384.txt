 URL : "https://github.com/pombase/website/issues/534" TITLE : faq category label BODY : in 336, val proposes lumping these old-faq categories together: querying/searching, datasets, locating genomic regions, sequence retrieval. that's fine, but raises a question: what should the new category be called? the text file with val's suggested organization has querying/finding/retrieving data/datasets , but that sort of looks like a placeholder, and i think it would be better to use a much shorter label on the web pages, preferably without any slashes. any objection to just finding data ? i'll use that for now, and it can be changed if @valwood or anyone else thinks up something equally brief but otherwise better.
