 URL : "https://github.com/aol/cyclops-react/issues/766" TITLE : fix monadplus typeclass BODY : both monadplus and monadzero rely on unsafe casting. monoidk type can be refactored to just take the witness type at the class level and the specific sub-data type at the method level - which will allow us to avoid casting entirely for monadplus and monadzero
