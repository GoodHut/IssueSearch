 URL : "https://github.com/tvkhoa/react-tippy/issues/31" TITLE : change z-index of tooltip BODY : hi! i want to change the z-index value of the tooltip, but i don't achieve to do it. i saw in vanilla-tippy docs that you can change the z-index value https://atomiks.github.io/tippyjs/ all-settings but it's not documented how to do the same in react-tippy docs. i tried to pass it like a normal prop called 'zindex' and i tried also to pass it as inline style, but the tooltip still has the same original zindex 9999 . am i doing something wrong or it's not supported in this version? i searched in the code of react-tippy and it seems z-index has been considered, that's why i'm asking. https://github.com/tvkhoa/react-tippy/blob/5f2a06e3cd42144a04ce5615131a2dafc3a3f950/src/tooltip/js/core/createpopperelement.js l32 thanks in advance
