 URL : "https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-combo-box/issues/422" TITLE : allow custom input BODY : description this element is awesome, congratulations for its contributors! expected outcome a config property for the element that allows it to not be constrained by its items values, allowing custom inputs when nothing matches. this way, the combo box should act only as a helper to get to the result faster. actual outcome today, when an inserted value is not present on the items array property, the blur event just wipes the combo box data. -- can it be done today with some config property or is it on the roadmap? couldn't find it on the docs. thanks in advance!
