 URL : "https://github.com/Kargoh/prj-rev-bwfs-dasmoto/issues/2" TITLE : wrap long lines in html BODY : just a minor code styling suggestion. it's good practice to wrap long lines of code to ~80 characters so that we can see all the code in the window without scrolling. something to keep in mind! to wrap, just have a newline in the code itself. it won't wrap like that in the actual page since newlines in html are only possible through <br /> so for most html you can comfortably add newlines and wrap text without changing the page look. https://github.com/kargoh/prj-rev-bwfs-dasmoto/blob/master/dasmoto's%20arts%20%26%20crafts/index.html l16 https://github.com/kargoh/prj-rev-bwfs-dasmoto/blob/master/dasmoto's%20arts%20%26%20crafts/index.html l22 https://github.com/kargoh/prj-rev-bwfs-dasmoto/blob/master/dasmoto's%20arts%20%26%20crafts/index.html l28
