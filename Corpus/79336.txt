 URL : "https://github.com/Chessmasterrr/SimpleStatsWidget/issues/1" TITLE : separate text and values BODY : as for me, the widget box is higher than wide. thus i would suggest to set the text sms and calls on top of the corresponding value. then it should look like a chart, with all entries having the same orientation. it might also be nice to change the background colour a bit, lets say the text gets a dark grey and the values stay with a black, to immediately see what you are looking for.
