 URL : "https://github.com/jogleasonjr/electron-react-webpack-quick-start/issues/6" TITLE : debugging from vscode BODY : hi - was able to start without debugging with the vanilla project but not able to debug vscode, windows 10 - kept seeing: cannot connect to runtime process, timeout after 10000 ms - reason: cannot connect to the target: connect econnrefused.... . followed by a random port number. this was fixed by adding 'protocol: legacy ' to the windows configuration in launch.json based on a suggestion from a www search - i have no idea why it made a difference!!
