 URL : "https://github.com/androidthings/contrib-drivers/issues/81" TITLE : approval to contribute? BODY : hello, guys. i have written a driver for the max31865 rtd-to-digital converter. it is limited at this point in that you have to ask the device to make a measurement for you, but it works. i am currently adding code in order to take full advantage of the device's capabilities, including repeated automatic measurements at this point. i would like to contribute to this project and add that driver here. i followed the instructions here https://github.com/androidthings/contrib-drivers/blob/master/contributing.md and submitted the individual cla, but have yet to hear anything back. is there anything else i need to do before i can start contributing to the project? thanks. -mario
