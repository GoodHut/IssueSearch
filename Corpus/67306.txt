 URL : "https://github.com/LightsHope/server/issues/98" TITLE : phasing @ deeprun tram. BODY : the bug goes like this: - if you enter the tram from if side, you will only see the closest tram. the furthest one will be invisible and even if you see players coming on it, you don't see the tram itself and you will fall through the air if you jump where you know it is, but can't see it. - viceversa if you enter from sw side, you only see the furthest one. - also after some distance traveled on the tram you will become phased, you won't see other players properly, or npcs there is nessy , and on the arrival you will not see objects/npcs until you get off the tram. not gamebreaking but seriously breaks immersion.
