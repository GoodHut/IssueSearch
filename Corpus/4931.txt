 URL : "https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/issues/1510" TITLE : huge file size BODY : i've been using fpdf for some time now and i'm to generate insurance policy documents for our customers at 509kb in file size. the document itself has a full-size front cover background image and then a second-page containing text about their policy. i've recreated this using dompdf but the outputted file-size is now 5,647kb - much larger than before. everything is the same and the background image that i'm using on the pst is only 444kb so i'm not quite sure how it's being produced that large. both my documents with dpdf and dompdf are 300dpi. any thoughts?
