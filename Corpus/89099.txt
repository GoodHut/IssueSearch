 URL : "https://github.com/erstrom/linux-ath/issues/4" TITLE : please list modifications BODY : hi! trying to combine your changes with a kernel with other unrelated patches. tried to copy the drivers/wireless/ath10k directory from your source tree. it does load the ath10k_usb module and the device is recognized but it cannot be brought up and multiple usb errors are logged in dmesg. have you patched anything outside the said directory? if so i would be glad if you post the changed files. thanks!
