BODY : mod version: dynamicsurroundings-1.12.2-3.4.7.2 forge version: 14.23.1.2556 link to crash log if applicable : description: i start the game up, all sounds work just fine, but when i go into a world, and while its settling down after loadup, all of a sudden the sounds just stop and all i hear is an ambient bird noise. even when i click into another window, it should mute but it keeps playing. i previously had ambience and mixtune in the pack but i removed them, and the issue didnt go away. also, it may not by you mod, but something else is causing me to have no fall damage and the difficulty keeps changing back to peaceful. here is a full log: fml-client-latest.log https://github.com/orecruncher/dynamicsurroundings/files/1545039/fml-client-latest.log also when i look at the log now, i see a repeating line of muting sounds and right before that, i see this line: 10:59:42 main/warn dsurround/ : unable to locate team.chisel.api.ifacade.getfacade is this a chisel incompatibility?
