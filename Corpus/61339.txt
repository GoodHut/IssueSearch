 URL : "https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/GeolocatorPlugin/issues/113" TITLE : api key's configuration BODY : hi james. i'm mexican and a bad writer of english, so be patient please and try to understand what i want to explain. specifically, are 3 questions: 1. in this plugin, you use the commons free web services of some providers like google, bing maps or another one? 2. if you use any web services, i suppose that you’re using api keys to build queries and consume the web services? 3. if you’re using some api key, it’s possible to change the api key or made it configurable? i hope you can help me with these doubts. regards.
