 URL : "https://github.com/serge-rider/dbeaver/issues/1534" TITLE : is it possible to log BODY : i occasionally use dbeaver in transactional mode to manually edit table data. it is very useful to be able to modify multiple rows in multiple tables and then commit all the changes simultaneously. however, although i have enabled query manager logging to file, i cannot see the actual changes made in the log. here is an example log excerpt after updating a number of rows and committing: !entry org.jkiss.dbeaver.core 0 201 2017-04-06 11:21:37.381 !message commit !entry org.jkiss.dbeaver.core 1 206 2017-04-06 11:28:42.991 !message select x. from <redacted> x where <redacted> in <redacted> !subentry 1 org.jkiss.dbeaver.core 1 0 2017-04-06 11:28:43.055 !message success 19 !entry org.jkiss.dbeaver.core 0 203 2017-04-06 11:28:39.808 !message commit !entry org.jkiss.dbeaver.core 0 207 2017-04-06 11:29:36.427 !message commit !entry org.jkiss.dbeaver.core 0 217 2017-04-06 11:31:01.897 !message commit as you can see, only the commits are shown. is there any way to make dbeaver log the content of the update queries too, so i can keep a record of the data which was manually changed?
