 URL : "https://github.com/ether-camp/ethereum-sandbox/issues/57" TITLE : expose personal api BODY : in order to test a dapp in ethereum studio realistically it would be good to support the full rpc api. currently web3.personal.unlockaccount sender, password, 120 ; results in error: method not found . this is most likely because the sandbox node is started without exposing the personal api.
