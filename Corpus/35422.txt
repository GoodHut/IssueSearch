 URL : "https://github.com/synfig/synfig/issues/427" TITLE : duplicating a canvas BODY : synfig version & platform : linux 1.3.4 issue description : duplicating a canvas along with its valuebase nodes is currently not possible. duplicating the corresponding group layer and re-exporting it results in a separate copy, except for the valuebase nodes that stay tied to the original canvas.
