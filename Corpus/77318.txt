 URL : "https://github.com/phetsims/sun/issues/290" TITLE : mutability of view nodes BODY : the biggest pain point during development of the last two sims has by far been common view components not supporting mutable properties or resizing content. examples include: - accordionbox not being able to resize based on content - radiobuttongroup not being able to re-layout when item nodes change size - radiobuttongroup's colors can't be changed - rectangularpushbutton/booleanroundtogglebutton/resetbutton's colors can't be changed - numberpicker's colors can't be changed - numberspinner's range couldn't be changed just refactored to a property today - shadedspherenode's colors can't be changed - passing in enabledproperty not supported by buttonmodel, so when buttons get recreated due to a color change extra code is required. - keypad layout or button visibility changes not possible i've been working around these by having to rebuild these components usually with mutableoptionsnode or contortions to compute the ideal size of the accordion/radiobuttongroup content before creation. this breaks down when i want to, for example, change a numberpicker's color during a pointer press, as recreating would presumably interrupt the press anticipated need in area model . i'd like to propose: 1. new common components should have this type of mutation as the default with a {property}, getter/setter, whatever for options, unless it doesn't make sense i.e. no one would want this, i'll buy jo a six-pack of beer if he needs to mutate this . 2. the above examples get fixed to include mutability and the option to resize, by default off for compatibility . i'm willing to do so if @ariel-phet says i have the time.
