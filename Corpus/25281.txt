 URL : "https://github.com/stephanenicolas/toothpick/issues/271" TITLE : what is smoothie ? BODY : is smoothe the name of a sample project or is it part of the library? it's very confusing. for example: https://github.com/stephanenicolas/toothpick/blob/master/smoothie-sample/src/main/java/com/example/smoothie/simpleapp.java how does this class live in com.example.smoothie package and depend on import toothpick.smoothie.module.smoothieapplicationmodule ?
