 URL : "https://github.com/dzufferey/psync/issues/8" TITLE : replace pickling by kryo BODY : unfortunately, scala pickling seems dead see https://github.com/scala/pickling/issues/452 and psync serialization heavily relies on it. an alternative to pickling is kryo https://github.com/esotericsoftware/kryo . i started to experiment with it. right now it only works for primitive types. i still need to figure out how to deal with classes.
