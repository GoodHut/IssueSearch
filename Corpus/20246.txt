 URL : "https://github.com/go-gorp/gorp/issues/353" TITLE : call with iterator BODY : gorp pulls all the records at once and provides no way of handling as you go it would be nice if you could pass a function block to gorp that would be invoked when a new row was fetched for the data by gorp. usage could be something like this type foo struct { bar string } func send writer io.writer { err := gorp.selectfunc func a foo { fmt.fprint writer,a.bar } , query string, args ... interface{} } this way the entire dataset does not need to be loaded into memory in order to process a row of data.
