 URL : "https://github.com/wojtpl2/ExtendedXmlSerializer/issues/109" TITLE : fluent api configuration BODY : your new fluent api isn't really fluent api. eg: c new configurationcontainer .configuretype<testclasswithencrypteddata> .member p => p.salary .encrypt .owner.configuration .configuretype<testclassprimitivetypesnullable> .member p=>p.propchar .encrypt .owner.configuration .useencryptionalgorithm .create ; in my last api it was easier to do this: c new configurationcontainer .configuretype<testclasswithencrypteddata> .member p => p.salary .encrypt .configuretype<testclassprimitivetypesnullable> .member p=>p.propchar .encrypt .useencryptionalgorithm .create ; in your solution all functions are public eg: configuration.find<encryptionextension> ; or configuration.add<object> <-- you are really able to call this in my only functions to configuration were public. all functions to internal use were internal. in your solution all function are public. you can get my last api and you can check: git checkout bca8b59a8f04e181a72b636d26597e1fc942738f for me if you type . in fluent api you should be able to call all functions from your level and all higher level. what do you think? i wanted to do this but it is very difficult to change in your solution.
