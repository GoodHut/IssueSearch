 URL : "https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/issues/75" TITLE : how to run the examples? BODY : as far as i know we have to first init a clean rn project and then add react-navigation via yarn or npm to the new project. if i got it right, we then have to navigate in the new project folder to node_modules/react_navigation and do the steps described here: https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/tree/master/examples/navigationplayground cd react-navigation npm install cd examples/navigationplayground npm install cd ../.. react-native start cd examples/navigationplayground react-native run-ios ignore packager starting error react-native run-android ignore packager starting error but if i do this, i get: 'android project not found' even with two separate shells. how do we run the examples on the correct way? am i the only one?
