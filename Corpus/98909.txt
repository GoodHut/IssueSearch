 URL : "https://github.com/millette/dat-shell/issues/11" TITLE : ln should work as expected BODY : currently, ln builds on mkfifo to create a fs fifo. in dat-shell, we can currently ln a-file-inside-dat.txt ~/filesystem-file.txt and from another terminal: tail ~/filesystem-file.txt cp ~/filesystem-file.txt somewhere.txt but unfortunately, neither mplayer nor vlc will play a video file linked in a such a way.
