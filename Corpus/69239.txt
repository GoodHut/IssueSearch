 URL : "https://github.com/guardianproject/phoneypot/issues/38" TITLE : support external camera BODY : i can think of multiple situations where one might want to make use of an external https://www.amazon.com/fredi-wireless-android-detection-support/dp/b06xymghpg/ camera https://www.amazon.com/sokos-waterproof-inspection-compatible-smartphones/dp/b01eq872o8/ or mic for their phoneypot. especially that some of these cameras already do have led lights. i haven't tested this myself but are they supported out of the box, if they're compatible with android? or do you need to add support for that?
