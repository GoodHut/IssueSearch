 URL : "https://github.com/teamtnt/tntsearch/issues/123" TITLE : can't search isolated word BODY : i just noticed strange thing. i am using laravel 5.4 with tntsearch which works great. have index files with relation added like that in my model file public function tosearchablearray { $a = $this->toarray ; $tags = $this->tags ->get 'name' ->map function $tag { return $tag 'name' ; } ; $a 'tags' = implode ' ', $tags->toarray ; return $a; } in scout.php i have that config: 'tntsearch' => 'storage' => storage_path , 'fuzziness' => env 'tntsearch_fuzziness', false , 'fuzzy' => 'prefix_length' => 2, 'max_expansions' => 50, 'distance' => 2 , 'asyoutype' => false, 'searchboolean' => env 'tntsearch_boolean', true , , and the problem is: every tag relation to model searches fine, when boolean search is off, but when i turned it on i can't search for isolated tag. is that some kind of keyword, that we can not use? also is there any way to read the whole content of .index file?
