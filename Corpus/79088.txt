 URL : "https://github.com/lbl-srg/soep/issues/21" TITLE : revise fmi specification BODY : @tsnouidui : i merged your text to the master. can you please read it once again and clean up the file. for example, there is wording like in listing 5.2, d2 /dt2 depends on the event indicator. -- a variable is missing, and i don't quite now what this means to say. you need to say what index refers to in higherorder index= 5 i guess that is the index of the state variable, but it is not clear. let's be explicit to avoid misunderstanding. we wrote now that we will say that z=aâˆ’x is the event indicator , but there are still several locations where it says event indicator function . we should be consistent in the terminology to make it easier for others to understand.
