 URL : "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27067" TITLE : maintain a nuget package BODY : describe the feature maintain a nuget https://www.nuget.org/ package. justification : i'm using es as part of my open source project. the setup of this project requires the presence of es. in order for the setup instruction to be simpler i decided to store the binaries of es as part of my repository which is a bad practice - i'm doing this since i write in c and can't use java package managers such as maven. i'm planning on migrating all my 3rd party packages to nuget but i prefer that the owners of the packages will maintain the nuget package instead of me... any thoughts are welcome.
