 URL : "https://github.com/opensourcepos/opensourcepos/issues/1625" TITLE : intellij phpstorm licenses BODY : just to let people in the team know that i have a little surprise as like last year . don't know how many of you use jetbrains ide for development but i've gotten a couple of licenses for the work we're doing on this project. just ping me if you're interested, they're one year valid and work for most of their products. specifically for php i use phpstorm which works pretty well imho
