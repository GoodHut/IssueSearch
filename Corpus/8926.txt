BODY : i'm testing the speed-up of cifar-20 on tf and pytorch. in tf, typically it can converge within 80k steps, which is 80k batches, and when we set batch-size-128, that should be around ~205 epochs in pytorch. one interesting thing is, in tf i can finish 80k steps in about 6 hours. but in pytorch, running 200 epochs took me around 13 hours. and this will expand to around 20 hours if i want to test 300 epochs. i thought pytorch should be much faster than tf. does anyone knows the solution to this? btw. i'm using ec2 g2.2xlarge .
