 URL : "https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper/issues/701" TITLE : book crash fixed? BODY : so, it looks like there's a guy with some sort of crash on my server, looking through the logs i found stuff that lead me to books, i quickly googled and found this: https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/hacked-client-that-freezes-server.235060/ post-2372858 and i'm wondering if this is fixed or will be fixed in a future version. i'm using 1.8.8 = 443 currently.
