 URL : "https://github.com/GeoScripting-WUR/Intro2Linux/issues/7" TITLE : additional notes on bash BODY : some points on bash that came up: - make it more clear what the shebang line means - point out that an error about interpreter /bin/bash^m is due to line endings, scripts copied from windows do not run as-is on linux and vice versa - variable assignments in bash must not have spaces on either sides of the = sign - some useful points for the assignment: - means a comment - echo prints things in the console, but can also be used in creative ways with file creation etc. - wget and curl , unzip - script arguments: $@ , $1 , $2 , ... - pipes can be used to avoid temporary files
