 URL : "https://github.com/openoakland/TrashTalk/issues/116" TITLE : see click fix integration BODY : i see the value of someone posting a report on scf and then being able to organize a cleanup to do something about it. but i'm not seeing where that information about trashtalk cleanups is displayed at scf so that users of scf become aware that something is being done. so maybe that's something we want to work towards? to sum that up: - allow users of scf to click a link to organize a trashtalk cleanup event. - allow users of trashtalk to post a report to scf that's related to an event. if i'm misunderstanding what we're doing with this feature, help me out. i've started planning the integration with see click fix. - add seeclickfix integration - update links to scf on the forms/pages
