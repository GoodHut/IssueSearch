 URL : "https://github.com/RoboCup-SSL/ssl-rules/issues/9" TITLE : double touch clarification BODY : in the last years, slightly touching the ball twice, without significantly moving it was penalized with a double touch. from my point of view, the rule should mainly enforce a pass to enhance the gameplay, but not punish inaccurate movement. i would suggest to define a double touch more precisely, e.g. the ball has to be >50mm away from the touching robot between two intermediate touches. this has the following advantages: more fluent gameplay due to less stoppages, especially for new teams an autoreferee can not detect slight touches and would profit from a clear definition of double touch. the rules currently state: for both direct and indirect free kicks, the ball must be stationary when the kick is taken and the kicker does not touch the ball a second time until it has touched another robot. free-kicks.tex:6
