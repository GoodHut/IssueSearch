 URL : "https://github.com/quasar-analytics/quasar/issues/2800" TITLE : reenable spark in master BODY : this entails fixing the following three things: - propagate the stupid context classloader stuff through to whatever netty is doing - ensure that no other areas are similarly problematic - make the sparkcore project publish two assembly jars during publication: with and without the spark dependency + also make the spark assembly jars match the naming convention of the other connectors while we're at it once all of this is done, we can reenable spark publication in build.sbt as well as in scripts/publishjar .
