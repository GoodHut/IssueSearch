 URL : "https://github.com/HackerExperience/Infrastructure/issues/40" TITLE : use the new iocage BODY : default iocage supplied by pkg is the iocage_legacy version. in addition to the odd behavior mentioned at 39, sometimes server restarts overwrite the resolv.conf and totally ignores the resolver='nameserver 8.8.8.8;nameserver 8.8.4.4' entry. if these behaviors persist on the new version we should probably file a bug on upstream.
