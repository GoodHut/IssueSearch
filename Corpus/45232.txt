 URL : "https://github.com/jbox-web/redmine_git_hosting/issues/688" TITLE : hooks url returns 404 BODY : sorry, i didn't find any information on the web regarding this topic so i open an issue. i installed redmine_git_hosting today as documentated on the website. server/ software configuration is ubuntu 14.04 lts with ruby 2.1.3 and redmine 3.2. redmine is served by puma which is proxied by an apache2 webserver, as other tools are running on that server as well. well everything seems to work - i installed the hooks via gui link in the configuration section and the symlinks are added to the git repositories via gitolite. config test is all green. but when i push something the post-receive hooks are not called. so i tried to debug this and started with a call of the hooks url in my web browser, which results in a 404. called: https://hostname/githooks/post-receive/redmine that should not be the case?! any idea?
