 URL : "https://github.com/CleverCloud/issues-helper/issues/1" TITLE : editing issues in $editor BODY : i'd like to work on a feature that would allow the edition of the issue to be in $editor , allowing for bigger issues. right now, i would like to propose a file like git commit messages templates. something along the lines of issue title <blank line> issue body i am not sure how to handle labels/tags though. delimiter -separated words on the second line ? a hashtag system ?
