 URL : "https://github.com/Aviana/YaHT/issues/5" TITLE : multi-shot cast bar bug BODY : hey there! i love your addon, it's the only one that actually tracks the autos without bugging or anything, but i encountered this bug on the lightbringer realm on light's hope. if i log on fresh and use my multi-shot i assume this happens with aimed shot too, cant confirm because i don't have it it will say nothing on the cast bar. but after i cast anything, dismiss pet, hearthstone, even mining, it will show the last used spell that has a cast on the cast bar during multi-shot cast. hope to hear from you! ! multi_shot_bug https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34176960/33510643-254a46cc-d717-11e7-875c-e865b2d5eb80.png
