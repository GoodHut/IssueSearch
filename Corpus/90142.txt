 URL : "https://github.com/blueimp/nightwatch/issues/3" TITLE : running tests in parallel BODY : hi, i am running into issues running tests in parallel. if i updated the test_workers param to true in the nightwatch.json and run docker-compose run --rm nightwatch both sample tests i have configured to run fail immediately, without starting the tests. i have looked at the docker containers and as much logs as possible but i have found no relevant information. i have gotten tests running in parallel outside of docker, so wondering if you have any advice on how to run tests across a number of workers within the docker container? thanks, eric
