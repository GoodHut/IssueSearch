 URL : "https://github.com/tenex/rails-assets/issues/396" TITLE : slow and backlogged? BODY : i noticed bundle update was taking many seconds to do the fetching gem metadata from https://rails-assets.org/... etc steps. checking the site i see a lot of pending builds and pending reindex for various versions of mozilla--pdfjs-dist x.x.xxx , i think pdfjs is rather huge so maybe that's clogging up the system? dunno how much monitoring you have, maybe there's no problem.
