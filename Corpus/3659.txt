 URL : "https://github.com/Xiphe/Password-Generator-for-zsh/issues/1" TITLE : symbols ' and BODY : hi! im using your plugin a lot and i like it, the only problem i have is, i keep on running into quotes errors in some cases like mysql . i would love to have symbol pw's without quotes. i was wondering if you could implement some kind of symbol-exclude flag where i can exclude the quotes, or some a symbol flag where you can pass your own symbols. maybe even considering removing quotes from symbols list, because it can lead to some escaping errors in some cases like building a sql query? bg dni
