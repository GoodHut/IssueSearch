 URL : "https://github.com/FACN3/umm-el-fahem/issues/43" TITLE : let vs const BODY : you are using let a lot throughout your project. however in some cases here https://github.com/facn3/umm-el-fahem/blob/master/src/handler.js l65 and here https://github.com/facn3/umm-el-fahem/blob/master/src/handler.js l113 for example you could just use const. i don't think the variable is reassigned therefore it should be a const.
