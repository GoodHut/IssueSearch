 URL : "https://github.com/sysgears/spin.js/issues/12" TITLE : custom webpack plugin BODY : to be honest spin.js works very well and most of it comes out of the box. it frees up a lot of build configuration time, but what if we want to overwrite the out of the box webpack configuration or add new webpack plugin. for example like i was referring in 10 which needs css plugin. i do see you have plugins option, was there any example how to use it. will this be the way to add custom webpack plugins based on our needs? i don't feel like i need any additional plugins other than that comes from out of the box from spin.js right now but want to make sure this is supported as well.
