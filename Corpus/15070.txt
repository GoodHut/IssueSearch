 URL : "https://github.com/coturn/coturn/issues/95" TITLE : coturn sleep mode BODY : we have a webrtc video communication solution. thers is actually less traffic on the system because this is a new software and we don't have much customers at the moment. if i start a video call the video quality is very bad for the first minute, after that time the quality is stabilized. now my question is, is there a sleep mode in coturn? if there is no traffic coturn turns in sleep mode and awakes if new traffic is incoming? and therefore i get a poor quality for the first time? is the any parameter to turn of the sleep time? thank you chris
