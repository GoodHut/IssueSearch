 URL : "https://github.com/marbl/metagenomeScope/issues/6" TITLE : add tutorial to readme BODY : _from @fedarko on august 4, 2016 20:53_ explaining the workflow for collate.py and for the viewer interface. ~~also—if we're still doing it—should mention that negative nodes are prefixed with 'c', for complement e.g. +3, -3 --> 3, c3 due to graphviz not liking '-' in node names.~~ _copied from original issue: fedarko/metagenomescope 30_
