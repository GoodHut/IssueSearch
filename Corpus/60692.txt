 URL : "https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-python/issues/45" TITLE : add calibration utility BODY : the pslab unit's analog and digital features must be calibrated in order to make it accurate. the ads1115 16-bit adc http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ads1113.pdf is a 4-channel, 0-3.3v adc that can be interfaced via i2c . typical initial accuracy of the internal voltage reference 0.01% and data rates higher than 500sps are possible. it is also cost effective. therefore, it appears to be most suited to calibrate individual pslab devices. tasks - add i2c communication library for ads1115 - include methods for reading single ended , and differential channels - include selection of voltage range and voltage reference - add qt based ui . features : - calibrate ch1, ch2, ch3 & pv1, pv2, pv3 using ads1115. generate cubic interpolation functions for each - calibrate pcs using a measured load resistor, and calibrated analog channel. generate interpolation function - calibrate cap using precision capacitors - write all calibration constants into flash memory after assigning a timestamp - store raw calibration data in a client-side folder
