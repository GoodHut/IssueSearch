 URL : "https://github.com/dsyer/spring-boot-thin-launcher/issues/6" TITLE : readme out of date. BODY : hi, this is a wonderful idea to keep the artefact as small as possible. unfortunately the documentation in the readme seems to be not up to date. the instructions on how to configure maven https://github.com/dsyer/spring-boot-thin-launcher maven ends in a failed build. and it seems that module-layout is not supported anymore https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/8008 ? furthermore a properties file 'thin.properties' is mentioned multiple times. but i cant find such a properties file generated in the jars build. maybe this could be clarified? regards j√∂rg
