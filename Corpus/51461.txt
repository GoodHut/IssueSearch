 URL : "https://github.com/techannihilation/TA/issues/281" TITLE : anti nuke rocket fails BODY : anti nuke does not fly high enough after it got launched, and it crashes into hills sometimes, when it flys towards enemys nuke. happens only if you build anti nuke close to the hill but players treat it like a bug and get angry. make vertical start last longer and make rocket a bit faster to balance this?
