 URL : "https://github.com/TeamFRM/TAIGA/issues/98" TITLE : new trait: decompression BODY : in contrast to compression, decompression obviously decompresses blocks and items to gain different items. blocks that would conform to this would be obsidian to stone, netherrack to lava, prismarine to water while also gaining pris. crystals and shards , hardened clay into clay blocks, and hardened ice into ice or snow. i'm sure other people could come up with more conversions, but that's all i have for now.
