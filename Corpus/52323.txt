 URL : "https://github.com/mail-in-a-box/mailinabox/issues/1200" TITLE : checking ipv6 notation BODY : hi, i think this is a bug, isnt it? this domain should resolve to your box's ip address aaaa 2a01:xxxx:0191:64d0:0000:0000:0000:0004 if you would like the box to serve webmail or a website on this domain. the domain currently resolves to 2a01:xxxx:191:64d0::4 in public dns. it may take several hours for public dns to update after a change. this problem may result from other issues listed here. it´s the same ipv6 address but mail in a box isn´t recognize it.
