 URL : "https://github.com/lucasoptimizely/jolo-converter/issues/1" TITLE : difficult to debug BODY : this package throws errors that are not really intelligible, making it virtually impossible to debug very simple issues eg, typos/syntax errors . this could be because it's throwing strings instead of errors - that might make it now give a stack trace? not sure what the exact reason is but the current situation is untenable. @wangjoshuah
