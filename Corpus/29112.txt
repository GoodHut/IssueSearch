BODY : hi there. i was excited to download cursive today, and while it is clearly a well-made tool, there are some issues that i'm having trouble getting around. for example, when using the repl, any time i enter text, it appears below the repl panel, which definitely kills the user experience for me for reference, this is on a windows 10 machine . i also see that there are 790 open issues at the moment, and no code in the repo, so it's not like i can personally confirm when the last code was committed. unfortunately, it's looking like alot of fundamental clojure tools have just been more or less abandoned. this and light table, the only two good clojure editors i can find, seem to have no maintainers, and since i'm not really willing to learn emacs just so i can do some basic learning projects, i'll probably end up abandoning the language. am i wrong? is this ide maintained?
