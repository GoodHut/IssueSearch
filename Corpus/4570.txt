 URL : "https://github.com/breunigs/frank/issues/34" TITLE : dump debug log BODY : it would be cool, if frank had a command to dump a debug log of the last 10 minutes or so or a timeframe that could be specified , so that bugs can be inspected. there's not always someone with enough access and knowledge in the channel, so if a bug occurs, the logs sometimes just scroll away and it's difficult to find them. if anyone could trigger a log-dump for later, that would probably be easier. if this is done, pay attention to not allow dos-attacks; only keep a limited number of dumps and also limit the time frame the dumps will contain. and the log-dump shouldn't be world-readable, i guess.
