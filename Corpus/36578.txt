 URL : "https://github.com/webmiddle/webmiddle/issues/4" TITLE : html page navigation BODY : add a way to navigate html pages, instead of just treating them as plain text resources. types of navigations: - follow links - submit forms a way to do this could be to create an apposite service that accepts html resources and exposes a set of properties to interact with them. the service will execute the proper http calls depending on the type of navigation for following links, submitting forms, etc. and then will return the new html resource.
