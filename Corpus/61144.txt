 URL : "https://github.com/fire-eggs/FamilyLines/issues/42" TITLE : adjust the zoom control BODY : <b>notonyournelly codeplex </b> <br />the zoom control needs to be tweaked. issues include: the quotfull zoom inquot size is for demo purpose only: it serves no practical purpose. zoom step is too large at around quotactual sizequot. need slightly finer control. quotzoom to fitquot would be nice to have. adjust the zoom range and slider step values to be a little more user friendly. consider adding quotzoom to fitquot and quotzoom 100%quot mechanisms menu or gadgets .
