 URL : "https://github.com/AVsitter/AVsitter/issues/12" TITLE : rlv picking channel 0? BODY : someone posted this in the group: > here comes the weirdness: in any item i equip with the latest avsitter2 + rlv plugin, whatever button i press gets chatted out in local chat under my name, as if i've typed it out. this also happens in the untouched examples they include. this obviously means some dialog is picking channel 0, but i couldn't reproduce it. i'm unclear about the meaning of item i equip with the latest avsitter2 + rlv plugin . not sure if the items are props and equipping them means attaching them, or by equipping the op meant to add the scripts to an unscripted furniture piece. either way, i still can't reproduce this issue with the examples. if someone can give me some reproduction steps, i can take a look.
