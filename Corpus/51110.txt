 URL : "https://github.com/twisted/mantissa/issues/65" TITLE : add reverse proxy mode BODY : this probably shouldn't be active all the time, but it would be something to activate when running behind a reverse proxy, in order to set the request protocol / host / port correctly based on x-forwarded-proto and host so that url generation happens correctly. we could have a flag on siteconfiguration that activate this, along with code in the site that calls sethost based on the incoming request headers.
