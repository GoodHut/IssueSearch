 URL : "https://github.com/simplaio/simpla/issues/77" TITLE : move storage to adapter BODY : <!-- thanks for reporting an issue! remember, an issue isn't the place for support requests or 'how to' questions. use stack overflow or join us on slack https://slack.simpla.io instead --> i'm submitting a - bug report - x feature request description right now simpla is tightly coupled to using github as a backend. instead, we should split both auth and storage into adapters. under this setup the auth adapter would handle everything to do with user management, rather than just authenticating an access token with github, and the storage adapter would just check with the auth adapter whether a change can be written, and then go ahead and write that change to where it's configured to. public api would stay relatively unchanged js simpla.init { storage: new simplagithub { repo: 'username/repo' } , auth: new simplanetlify { site: 'mysite' } , ... } ;
