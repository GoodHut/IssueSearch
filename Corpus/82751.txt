 URL : "https://github.com/catamphetamine/react-phone-number-input/issues/93" TITLE : apply template when known BODY : one of the things i'd like this component to do is as soon as it has a template to use, it applies it. one of the things i notice with some countries is that no phone number template e.g. selecting united kingdom from the list and then typing '555' doesn't result in a space between the first two and the third digit. this is despite the fact that the as_you_type class has a partially populated template value that would be useful. is there a reason why the template doesn't apply when i select from the menu but does apply when i type the +44?
