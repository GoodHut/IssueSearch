 URL : "https://github.com/marbl/parsnp/issues/31" TITLE : sequence headers in .xmfa BODY : does anyone know how to interpret the sequence headers in the .xmfa file? for example, take the following: >28:462049-462515 - cluster8 s134:p5601 i understand that 28 indicates the genome, 462049-462515 the coordinates, - the strand, and cluster8 the lcb. but what about s134:p5601 ? what does this indicate? i already read about the format here and couldn't find the answer: http://darlinglab.org/mauve/user-guide/files.html thanks!
