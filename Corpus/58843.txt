 URL : "https://github.com/clearcontainers/runtime/issues/292" TITLE : support containerd 1.0 BODY : docker is planning to switch their stack from the current 0.2.4 containerd to a completely new containerd 1.0 https://containerd.io/ implementation https://github.com/containerd/containerd . there are many architectural changes with this new containerd implementations, and we may be impacted by mostly 2 of them: - a new grpc interface for the shim. containerd no longer calls directly into containerd-shim but talks to a grpc socket instead. by default containerd 1.0 ships with a canonical implementation containerd-shim for this grpc interface but we should eventually implement it as part of our own shim implementation and get rid of one layer from our docker based container stack. - a strong bound to runc . containerd heavily relies on the latest and greatest runc cli which is not specified anywhere. it takes several runc specific assumptions as well. we will have to implement most of the missing runc options on order to safely work with containerd 1.0. i put together a quick gist to run cc 3.0 with test the latest containerd code: https://gist.github.com/sameo/fa32cfe4f7a74d9eea74982bb1f0100d.
