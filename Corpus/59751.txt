 URL : "https://github.com/matthistuff/buffer-node/issues/2" TITLE : use callback interface BODY : currently it is possible because your version of promise dependency provide . nodeify method for that: js api.info.configuration .nodeify callback function callback err, response { console.log arguments } but the point is, you are using request dependency that use a callback style, then you convert the callback style into a promise and later you convert the promise into callback . wtf. better approach for handle cb or promise is: - if a function is provider as last argument in the callback, then return callback style. - otherwise, return a promise. i made this behavior before in others libraries. check this line https://github.com/kikobeats/json-future/blob/master/lib/index.js l39 , for example.
