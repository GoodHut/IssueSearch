BODY : hi, i am wondering if it is possible to use this purchasable ti sensing patch: http://www.ti.com/lit/an/sloa212a/sloa212a.pdf for my understanding it is possible to attach a battery and using a rf430frl152h instead of a rf430frl153h should make no difference, am i right? thank you very much in advance! cheers, manuel
