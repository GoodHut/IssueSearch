 URL : "https://github.com/domino14/Webolith/issues/253" TITLE : socket robustness issues BODY : it seems that the front end does not always get socket info from the backend. this looks like someone guesses a word and then they have to guess it again in order for it to register. there are two things going on here: - lastguesscorrectness defaults to true until it is set by handleguessresponse . we should fix the lastguess behavior - the backend got the data but the front-end did not get the back-end's command to mark it correct so handleguessresponse possibly did not get called . the frontend should try confirming that the back-end got the response, or viceversa. searching for event=guess-not-correct in the logs shows a surprising number of hits. however, many of these could just be people guessing a word they've already guessed and forgotten about. { log : info 2017-10-16 11:54:46,108 socket_consumers.py::ws_message:190 got a message from plasticene: {\ room\ :\ 1220671\ ,\ type\ :\ guess\ ,\ contents\ :{\ guess\ :\ par\ goes\ }} , stream : stderr , time : 2017-10-16t11:54:46.109083555z } { log : info 2017-10-16 11:54:49,510 socket_consumers.py::ws_message:190 got a message from plasticene: {\ room\ :\ 1220671\ ,\ type\ :\ guess\ ,\ contents\ :{\ guess\ :\ par\ goes\ }} , stream : stderr , time : 2017-10-16t11:54:49.51028214z } { log : info 2017-10-16 11:54:49,516 game.py::guess:872 event=guess-not-correct guess=pargoes , stream : stderr , time : 2017-10-16t11:54:49.517223087z }
