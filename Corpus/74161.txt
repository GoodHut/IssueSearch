 URL : "https://github.com/Inventory-Tweaks/inventory-tweaks/issues/509" TITLE : dupe bug with ctrl-click BODY : playing current 20171012 ver of ftb beyond 1.10 mcp 9.19 fml 8.0.99.99 forge 12.18.3.2422 actuallyadditions 1.10.2-r105 jei 3.14.7.419 invtweaks 1.61-58-a1fd884 normal operation: using ctrl+click on a vanilla inventory will transfer 1 item from a stack to/from the player's inventory. ctrl+leftclick drops the 1 item on an existing stack in the destination inventory. ctrl+rightclick creates a new stack for each 1 item transferred. if ctrl+clicking with no gui open, it will transfer 1 item between the hotbar and the player's main inventory. ctrl+clicking with an aa machine gui open tested with farmer, canola press and coal gen results in jei's spawn item functionality being triggered even though spawn mode is currently disabled . a ctrl+rightclick spawns a single item. a crtl+leftclick spawns the difference between the partial stack being clicked, and the max stack size. tested with coal and canola. originally, i discovered this with actuallyadditions machines. just now, i have also gotten this result when trying to ctrl-click a tico hammer into the tool forge. x-posting to jei git. https://github.com/mezz/justenoughitems/issues/1024 cheers!
