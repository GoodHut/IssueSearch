 URL : "https://github.com/project-dune/dune/issues/14" TITLE : create osdi'12 tag BODY : hi, i noticed that dune project does not have a tag related to osdi'12. i would like to suggest the creation of osdi'12 tag for keeping the results published on that conference replicable. maybe the current state of master reflects it. i believe this can benefit the project since it is possible to manage the new contributions as an evolution from the original idea.
