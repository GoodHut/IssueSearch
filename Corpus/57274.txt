 URL : "https://github.com/Silverquark/i3PlusPlus/issues/10" TITLE : printing speed setting BODY : all of the printing settings fan, bed temp, extruder temp work except the printing speed. i've tried running it from 10% to 200% and there is no perceived change in x/y speed during the print job. the odd thing was that the extrusion speed seemed to be effected by the setting. at lower speeds the nozzle under extrudes and at higher speed settings the extruder would over extrude. its as if the x and y and maybe z speeds are unchanged, but the e speeds are.
