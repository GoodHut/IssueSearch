 URL : "https://github.com/jdsteinbach/frontrangefrontend/issues/1" TITLE : a better logo BODY : i made a logo that's meh . it creates some mountain shapes with some < characters - combining the two main ideas: the front range of the rocky mountains and front-end development. you can see it in the header: https://frontrangefrontend.com i would love for someone with design skills to try a logo that looks good. here are the goals: 1. visually communicate mountains & code. 2. use existing color scheme from site. 3. incorporating initials/name is nice, but not necessary see 4 . 4. needs a version that looks good in a square/circle crop the current logo kind of only works in landscape, looks bad on twitter https://twitter.com/frontrangefe . 5. an ai file or svg would be the ideal final format. i don't expect a perfect logo in one try: happy to spend time talking about concepts & answering follow-up questions. i also appreciate the hacktoberfest volunteer help, so i'm not going to bog you down in endless revisions/nitpicks.
