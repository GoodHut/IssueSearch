 URL : "https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/2537" TITLE : z_sendmany usability bug BODY : describe the issue this is a usability bug. currently, you have to use z_sendmany to send from a t-address. that's inconsistent. particularly when you use getnewaddress to get a t-address and z_getnewaddress to get a z-address. it follows that you should use sendmany to send from a t-address and z_sendmany to send from a z-address. the first time anyone uses z, they try using sendmany and get an obscure error message, meaning that people think they've lost their coins. can you reliably reproduce the issue? if so, please list the steps to reproduce below: 1. try to use sendmany to send from a t-address. expected behaviour sendmany should send from a t-address to a t-address actual behaviour + errors no transaction is made because it's currently set to only send via z_sendmany . the version of zcash you were using: v1.0.10-1
