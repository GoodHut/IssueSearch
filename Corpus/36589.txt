 URL : "https://github.com/cascobay/cascobay/issues/23" TITLE : https map load error BODY : when accessing site through https https://cascobay.github.io/cascobay/ , the map fails to fully load. ! screen shot 2017-04-22 at 1 34 38 pm https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5316367/25306690/78502d12-2760-11e7-8881-09bf01b97b33.png . there are 3 mixed content error messages. the app is requesting the following urls over http: - http://cdn.leafletjs.com/leaflet/v0.7.7/leaflet.css - http://www.cascobay.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/focb-logo_final-300x78.png - http://i2.wp.com/www.cascobay.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/cropped-focb-profile-pic_final.jpg?fit=192%2c192 this throws an error when the app itself is being accessed by https. ensuring these urls are using https requests should resolve this issue.
