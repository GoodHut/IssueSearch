 URL : "https://github.com/Komodo/KomodoEdit/issues/3277" TITLE : ko11 collects some bloat BODY : komodo ide, version 11.0.0, build 90668, platform linux-x86_64. built on tue sep 19 16:11:12 2017. it's hard to tell a concrete repro case. basically doing a day's job, have 30+ files open, various types, mostly python. do a lot of debugging with from dbgp.client import brk; brk '127.0.0.1' , like 50 sessions started in a row. do editing... run some shell via toolbox/command, e.g. git gui blame --line=%l %f etc. after a few hours i end up with a randomly unresponsive ide, like moving the cursor takes seconds, ctrl+i, incremental search panel to appear takes seconds. it definitely slows down, to a point of being pita. closing ko takes 10+ seconds, ubuntu complains whether it should force close it. after restarting ko, all is back to normal.
