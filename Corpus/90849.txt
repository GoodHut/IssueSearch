 URL : "https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternengine-node-mustache/issues/15" TITLE : stylemodifiers not reset? BODY : i am using pattern lab node v2.11.0 on mac , using the webpack configuration. expected behavior when i include a pattern twice with different style modifiers, the patterns should be rendered with those style modifier differences. actual behavior when i include a pattern twice with different style modifiers, the pattern that is rendered first will overwrite all stylemodifiers of the second pattern that is rendered. steps to reproduce difficult to reproduce. what i have is a component called skew i call the like this: handlebars {{> components-skew }} in a very different place, i call it like this. handlebars {{> components-skew:inx-card__image-title|inx-card-skew--alpha|inx-card-skew--end image: false }} as soon i add the second include, the first include will render with the exact same stylemodifiers
