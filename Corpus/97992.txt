 URL : "https://github.com/Maultasche/ShipWar/issues/26" TITLE : implement an admin service BODY : implement an admin service that can be used for administering the system - externally available, but only allows admin users to use it - can make calls to the game admin service - can make calls to the user management service - i need to define exactly what this will do, but it should contain everything needed for an admin user to monitor what's going on and make any necessary changes. issue 25 should already be complete. we could do this earlier, but we'd probably have to refactor it along the way as things change. unless there's a big need for it earlier on, we can implement it after the main game features are complete.
