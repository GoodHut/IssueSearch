BODY : > i'm running: > > - which parity version? : version parity/v1.8.2-beta-1b6588c-20171025/x86_64-linux-gnu/rustc1.21.0 > - which operating system? : linux > - how installed? : via installer binaries > - are you fully synchronized? : no > - did you try to restart the node? : yes i have 40 gb vps and want to run parity to process payment for both eth and erc20 tokens . however when i run parity with following commands, blockchain size fills 40 gb: parity --pruning fast what is the minimum hardware requirements to process payments for eth and erc20 tokens? i know for erc20 i need full blockchain state for filter changes, but i wonder if a pruned node can work for me.
