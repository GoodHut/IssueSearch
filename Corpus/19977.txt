 URL : "https://github.com/OpenShot/openshot-qt/issues/832" TITLE : audio doesn't work BODY : windows 10 64 bits with latest version of openshot though the problem was present on the last version also. whenever i try to use the video preview of mp4 files, the audio doesn't work. in fact, the audio doesn't work in general in openshot. i can see that it is producing audio but it doesn't sound at all.
