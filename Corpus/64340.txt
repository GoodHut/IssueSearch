 URL : "https://github.com/cs136/seashell/issues/784" TITLE : full screen editor mode BODY : looks like this was never implemented in the ui overhaul. monaco does not seem to have a built-in implementation of this either. should do this to address instructor's concerns, pasted below: i just logged in and in terms of the interface, it seems to have gone back to using up a lot of space at the top of the screen. remember that for use in the classroom we really want to eliminate all of that extra white space at the top. that extra space costs us about 2-3 lines of code that wonâ€™t fit on the screen.
