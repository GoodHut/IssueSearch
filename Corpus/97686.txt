 URL : "https://github.com/rougier/gl-bezier/issues/1" TITLE : how is this code licensed? BODY : first of all, thanks for the great work here! i'd like to use some of it as a base for some work on https://github.com/paperjs/paper.js mainly for https://github.com/paperjs/paper.js/issues/1235 right now , but wanted to clear the license question first. paper.js is distributed under the mit license. would there be a conflict if some of the code was ported over?
