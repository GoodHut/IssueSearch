 URL : "https://github.com/operatorequals/covertutils/issues/10" TITLE : dual window mode BODY : this is a feature request and not an issue with the code. dual window mode is using 2 or more terminals to control the agent, one for sending commands and one for receiving output via tail -f of a log for example. this would prevent the intrusions and prompt overwrites caused by printing output to the same terminal and would make queuing commands for slower stealthier c2 channels much easier. for even more granularity it would be nice to have the option in the default shells to have different windows for true output being the responses for the commands sent to the agent , a debug window for tracking chunks/messages and garbage recv'd , and then the command input window that would contain whatever info is programed into the prompt.
