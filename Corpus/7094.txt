 URL : "https://github.com/StarcounterApps/Registration/issues/11" TITLE : delete this app BODY : this is one of the apps that have been laying around for a long time without any improvement. the only changes that have been made have been related to maintaining the app so that it can run and not use deprecated features. we can also see that on the current issues, 3 and 8, which are only related to maintaining. the functionality of this app is also overlapped by useradmin, which is an app that is used and has improved over time. i would suggest killing this app to avoid spending more time on maintaining. it would also help to keep this repository neat. cc @warpech @miyconst
