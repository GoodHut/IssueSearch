 URL : "https://github.com/blogifierdotnet/Blogifier/issues/69" TITLE : fix postbuild task BODY : executing xbuild requires that the build host has xbuild available during the build otherwise the entire build will fail. this is easily overcome by using the msbuild copy task. i already have the fix for this and making the api more intuitive: cs services.addblogifier databaseoptions, configuration ; app.useblogifier env ; // instead of configuration.initservices services, databaseoptions, configuration ; configuration.initapplication app, env ; i'm happy to submit a pr, just need to know if you want the pr based on dev or master
