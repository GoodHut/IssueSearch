 URL : "https://github.com/p4lang/p4-spec/issues/378" TITLE : psa traffic class BODY : wondering if it would make sense to introduce a traffic class type in psa and have the pre and buffering engine send_to_port/clone methods take a traffic class parameter as input. in several use cases, the controller may want the switch to assign different priorities to packets. i believe given the diversity of scheduling policies and the difficulty of modeling a generic scheduler , we should not try to define a full-blown scheduler extern in psa. but the ability to define the traffic class and the reference implementation bmv2 implementing a strict priority scheduler, for example, might be a good middle ground. what do others think?
