 URL : "https://github.com/freebroccolo/vscode-reasonml/issues/58" TITLE : no definition found ... BODY : i'm not entirely sure this is an issue with vscode-reason, but i'm also not sure where else to look. i am starting a project with the reason-react-example code found here https://github.com/chenglou/reason-react-example . one of the files looks like this: module pagereason = { include reactre.component.jsprops; type props = {message: string, extragreeting: option string}; let name = pagereason ; let render {props} => { let greeting = switch props.extragreeting { | none => how are you? | some g => g }; <div> <mybannerre show=true message= props.message ^ ^ greeting /> </div> }; / extragreeting is optional, which means the js side might pass in a null or undefined / type jsprops = js.t {. message : string, extragreeting : js.null_undefined string}; let jspropstoreasonprops = some fun jsprops => { message: jsprops message, extragreeting: js.null_undefined.to_opt jsprops extragreeting } ; }; include reactre.createcomponent pagereason; let createelement ::message ::extragreeting=? => wrapprops {message, extragreeting}; i am trying to understand where the js variable is coming from, what it does etc. but jump to definition is not working on it, instead it says no definition found. this is also true of the mybannerre component, which is in a sibling file. any help would be appreciated. thank you!!
