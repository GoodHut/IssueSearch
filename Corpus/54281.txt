 URL : "https://github.com/atmelcorp/atmel-software-package/issues/46" TITLE : flashing 8g emmc fails BODY : the failure occurs due to an integer overflow bug in samba_applets/sdmmc/main. there is a code path where mem_size in pages is calculated by expanding a value in k to bytes. this is done with uint32_t types and overflows for parts greater than 4g, resulting in an artificially small image size. i have a proposed fix that has solved my problem, though it may not be the best long term solution. regardless, i will submit a pr for reference.
