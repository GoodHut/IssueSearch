 URL : "https://github.com/wholesale-design-system/components/issues/47" TITLE : usage section of readme BODY : usage section of readme says: > run gulp for building / watcher > gulp test for test / watcher _i think it's explicitly implied that i have to run also npm install which in my opinion should also be documented _ after doing following: $ npm install $ gulp gulp fails with following output: 14:42:39 using gulpfile ~/dev/js/components/gulpfile.js 14:42:39 task 'default' is not in your gulpfile 14:42:39 please check the documentation for proper gulpfile formatting
