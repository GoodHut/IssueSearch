 URL : "https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/CRUD/issues/467" TITLE : datatables + lots of data BODY : i'm testing out displaying not all at once about 15k+ items; from what i can tell, backpack/crud is attempting to fetch all 15k+ items so that it can feed it to the jquery datatables plugin. whilst that plugin claims that client side should be able to handle up to 10k items it does say that waiting up front can be intolerably long. see https://datatables.net/manual/data/. it seems that i've been waiting about 5 minutes and counting i have my php script execution time set to about 30 mins but obviously this is somewhat...not usable. i'm wondering if there should be some configuration logic which goes: if it looks like it might return more than some configurable/hard coded number of rows then use server side processing; else use client side processing. or use server side processing all the time? i'm on ^3.2 of laravel-backpack/crud.
