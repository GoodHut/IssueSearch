 URL : "https://github.com/redpanda1234/barnes-rust/issues/17" TITLE : writeup .pdf in git repo BODY : git repos are meant primarily for source code; storing binary pdfs in git repos is not very great >: . consider building your .tex with travis-ci and offloading these files to a website for a more user-friendly experience. also, your write-up currently lacks substance and is a little boring to read.
