 URL : "https://github.com/corradio/electricitymap/issues/240" TITLE : reference for co2e values BODY : unless i am missing something, i couldn't find a reference to the co2e/kwh factors without digging in to the readme file, but the electricity supply data is well referenced within the viewer. could i suggest including a link to the wiki page that contains the factors within the viewer?
