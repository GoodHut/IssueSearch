 URL : "https://github.com/pablohpsilva/vuejs-component-style-guide/issues/3" TITLE : use <script> & etc BODY : i hope you're kiddin with this recommendation. nowadays most ides got nice defaults for <script> and, hey, html5 went towards simplification, not exausting developers by endless useless xmlns and other stuff. for example webstorm insists that you'll use type= text/babel for script tag to correctly interpret es6 skipping defaults . but it only means that this ide is buggy and we'll need to force their devs to fix this bug. there are many ides on the market, and you have a freedom to choose the right one. anyway, thank you for sharing this doc. our team has internal document on component styling for vue.js, part of it is comparable with your proposal, but definitely you have a worth things that we missed. i also should say that it would be nice to take 1.0 into account.
