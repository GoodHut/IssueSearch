 URL : "https://github.com/deanshub/pivot2/issues/35" TITLE : sort by multiple columns BODY : as a viewer , i want to be able to sort the pivot by multiple columns at the same time, so i can better control the pivot display and present the data that interests me the most at the top/bottom. ! image https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4380713/22514021/a3d5b70c-e8a6-11e6-864f-a6482c7b86c0.png - i want to be able to determine the first column to sort by - i should be able to choose the items - available sort options: 1. ascending 2. descending 3. no sort data in its original order - right clicking the pivot column title should open the column menu items, including the 'sort' menu, which will open the 3 sub-menu options.
