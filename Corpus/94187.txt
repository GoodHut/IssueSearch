kirk and other managers would like to be able to download all mdfs for all stations in a given month. currently, to download an mdf you have to go to the send mdf page and then download each mdf individually. it would be very helpful if there was a button similar to the export interceptee photos that would allow you to select a month for the desired mdfs.
