 URL : "https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs/issues/11260" TITLE : in progress issue labels BODY : as of writing this, there are 735 open issues on the cdnjs repo with the majority of them being requests to add/update libraries. the problem finding issues to work on is particularly difficult right now as the label in progress is not used proactively to label issues which are currently work in progress. due to this, a contributor needs to open up the issue on a new page and check if a pr has already been made and then decide if he can work on that issue or not. proposed solution and advantages if one of the maintainers would be kind enough to do so, we can create a system where a label of in progress is added as soon as the issue is mentioned in a pull request. this has the added advantage of making it faster to discover issues which aren't being worked on. now, all a new contributor needs to do is use the following criterion and find a new issue to work on without opening up the issue on a new page and check manually â€” doesn't have label in progress and has a label like request to add/update library . as simple as that. cc @peterdavehello
