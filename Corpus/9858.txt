 URL : "https://github.com/xiangzhou/GEMMA/issues/46" TITLE : add loco support BODY : we should add leave one chromosome out support to gemma. from what i can tell from the source code this is not particularly hard because gemma already tracks chromosome information. we need to recompute the kinship matrix for n chromosomes leaving one out and then rerun the lmm and run gemma n+1 times and present a result file with n+1 scores. i think this should be an internal feature of gemma and one would like to save the precomputed kinship matrices for rerunning with covariates etc.
