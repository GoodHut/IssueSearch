 URL : "https://github.com/elementary/calendar/issues/28" TITLE : ship high contrast icons BODY : it appears that the high contrast theme doesn't contain icons for quite a few actions and several are missing for apps. we should create a package that suppliments the existing highcontrast theme. for apps, we should probably ship the icon with the app itself like we already do with their hicolor icon. launchpad details: lp1310134 https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1310134 daniel fore - 2014-04-20 00:07:13 +0000
