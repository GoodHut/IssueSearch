 URL : "https://github.com/AliTVTeam/AliTV-perl-interface/issues/148" TITLE : re-add the --self option BODY : in early versions of alitv there was a --self option that allowed easy comparison of a genome against itself. it took advantage of the self option of lastz . a user reported to me that this option was useful and convenient. therefore i suggest re-adding this feature. what do you think @greatfireball ?
