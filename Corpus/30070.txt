 URL : "https://github.com/Nolanus/ng2-page-scroll/issues/160" TITLE : no scroll animation BODY : hi, i have installed the ng2-page-scroll into my angular 2 app and configured everything like you described. to scroll i am using the service. if i trigger the scroll it switches to the anchor region immediately without animation. i have no output in the console of the browser. i have tested the app in chrome and safari. import { component, inject } from 'angular/core'; import { document } from 'angular/platform-browser'; import { pagescrollconfig, pagescrollservice, pagescrollinstance } from 'ng2-page-scroll'; constructor private pagescrollservice: pagescrollservice, @inject document private document: any { } public scrolltocontact : void { let pagescrollinstance: pagescrollinstance = pagescrollinstance.simpleinstance this.document, ' contact' ; this.pagescrollservice.start pagescrollinstance ; }; after some debugging i figured out that the scroll finished before the first call of setinterval. i set a breakpoint to stopnow and it was hit after the scroll was completed. pagescrollinstance.timer = setinterval function _pagescrollinstance { // take the current time var currenttime = new date .gettime ; // determine the new scroll position var newscrollposition; var stopnow = false; my contact component in which the anchor is located is separated from the menu component where my scroll logic is implemented. any advice?
