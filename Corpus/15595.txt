 URL : "https://github.com/jagi/meteor-astronomy/issues/601" TITLE : events not firing BODY : for some reason, the only events i can get to fire are the init events. here's what my code looks like: javascript // in a server method import {team} from '../teams'; const leagueteams = team.find { leagues: { $in: league._id } } ; leagueteams.foreach team => { //does a bunch of stuff team.save } ; // in teams.js import { class } from 'meteor/jagi:astronomy'; const teams = class.create { name: 'team', collection: teams, fields: { // a bunch of fields }, events: { afterinit e { const team = e.currenttarget; console.log 'init', team ; }, beforesave e { console.log 'before save', e.currenttarget ; }, beforeinsert { console.log 'inserted' ; }, beforeupdate { console.log 'updated' ; }, aftersave { console.log 'after save' ; }, }, } export {team}; the only one that fires is init. any idea why? the collection is a scorpius collection with simple-schema attached overkill i know , so perhaps that's related? i'm having a tough time implementing a calculated field.
