 URL : "https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/6836" TITLE : how about updating luajit? BODY : this is not an issue. i wanted to make a pull request, but i saw that the link https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/c1026ff4b3b6500c06d5a2233214addbb41936cb/third-party/cmakelists.txt l96 point to internal luajit repo https://github.com/neovim/deps , consisting of sources https://github.com/neovim/deps/tree/master/src/luajit and a raw tarball file. since luajit-2.0.5 is out https://luajit.org/changes.html , i suggest to migrate.
