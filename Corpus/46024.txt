 URL : "https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp/issues/2187" TITLE : kind of infinite loop BODY : i found an infinite loop bug that happens on some specific pages and it causes crash after some short period of time executed like: http://www.quackit.com/html/codes/html_close_window_code.cfm https://www.codeproject.com/news.aspx?ntag=19837497577736552&_z=9716591 and there is more probably, i noticed it happens when page has many items on it but not really sure yet what causing this. page loads and loadingstatechanged event with args.isloading parameter after loading page is set to false. it continue firing it forever along with quick focus change from new browser back to any open random tab, also saw very quick change between forms and it blinks and it happens on clear form without any events attached. if window is closed when that loop is active, whole program crashes, but if user navigate to etc. google browser returns to working state and form can be closed safely or used again. i am unable to focus to any other open/minimised app during this event.
