 URL : "https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/issues/1895" TITLE : minimum ios version BODY : i wonder what is the minimum ios version to be able to run jitsi meet? if i want to change, for example, to support the lower ios version, where should i change? i ask this because i see the app deployment target is set to 9.0, but my friend who has ios 10 cannot run the app. does it has to do with build settings>base sdk ? because now it is set to latest ios 10.3 . if so, how do i change the base sdk? thank you
