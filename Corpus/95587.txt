BODY : the script seems to refresh the dialog box every second or tick, and clicking the 'delay portal' button doesn't seem to do anything. it just pops up again or more accurately, never goes away . after ten seconds of frantically clicking delay and cancel, the autoportal goes through anyways. the btc version worked normally when i was using it yesterday, so something's up with this fork.
