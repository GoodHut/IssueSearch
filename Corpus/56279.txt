 URL : "https://github.com/SchusterLab/quantum-optimal-control/issues/5" TITLE : module and class names BODY : as per pep 8 https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ package-and-module-names module names should be lowercase with multi-word names separated by underscores ie. this_is_a_correct_module_name . many modules have class style naming such as tensorflowstate.py . i believe that modules and classes should be renamed to agree with pep 8, which will make code more consistent and readable.
