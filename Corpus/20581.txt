 URL : "https://github.com/philipperemy/tensorflow-phased-lstm/issues/4" TITLE : computation of phi BODY : hi philippe, thank you very much for your implementation, it is really helpful. i was going through the code and found that your computation of phi differs from the equation of the paper, since you compute tf.mod twice. current code: def phi times, s, tau : return tf.div tf.mod tf.mod times - s, tau + tau, tau , tau implementation following equation 6 in the paper: def phi times, s, tau : return tf.div tf.mod times - s, tau , tau is there any reason why you did this modification? or is it an error? thanks, victor
