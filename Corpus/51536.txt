 URL : "https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues/8030" TITLE : array is getting reset BODY : i have been trying to figure out why the jetpack_relatedposts_filter_exclude_post_ids filter is not working for me when i pass an array of multiple post ids, yet it does work for me when i pass an array with a single post id. i discovered that the excluded_post_ids array is getting reset each time, so only the last post id is being passed to the filter. my fix is to comment out this line and now i am able to pass an array of many post ids to prevent them from appearing in related posts. https://github.com/automattic/jetpack/blob/f95fc1a8a7779909f05ff81b359e6b4287dd7d17/modules/related-posts/jetpack-related-posts.php l777
