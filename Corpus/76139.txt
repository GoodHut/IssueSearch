 URL : "https://github.com/skv-headless/react-native-scrollable-tab-view/issues/769" TITLE : initial page shows blank BODY : when i force an initial page to something other than the first page it is rendering blank. scrolling to other tabs will render data and then going back to that initial forced page renders the data correctly. using: react : 16.0.0-alpha.12 , react-native : https://github.com/expo/react-native/archive/sdk-21.0.2.tar.gz , any insights into fixing this would be great.
