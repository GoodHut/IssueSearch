 URL : "https://github.com/cooper/wikifier/issues/42" TITLE : category list pages BODY : right now you can view a category with the category post compilation. this is a page where every page associated with a category is displayed at once. if necessary, it is split up into multiple pages. optionally the category page can have a specified title and main page which appears at the top of the first page, regardless of the ordering otherwise. currently the only ordering, i think, is with the newest posts at the top based on @page.created . this category post compilation is mostly intended for use on blog-like sites, where categories are used as tags. i want to add another type of category page which, instead of displaying the page content, only lists the pages associated with the category, as category: pages on media wiki do. this new category page, like the existing ones, would show the main page of the category at the top. the main page likely would contain an explanation of what the contents of the category are. currently the root.category option is used for category post compilation. this is used for the ~category link type. so i'd need to consider how to make links to category page listings.
