 URL : "https://github.com/pimoroni/rp_usbdisplay/issues/14" TITLE : raspi zero w support BODY : hello - followed this tutorial with the latest image of raspian on a working raspi zero. when i go for the sudo depmod command i get this output: depmod: error: failed to load symbols from /lib/modules/4.4.50+/kernel/drivers/video/rp_usbdisplay.ko: invalid argument after that all is lost. do we have support for the raspi zero models yet? i didn't see any disclaimers that the a processors weren't covered with this display. thanks! ben
