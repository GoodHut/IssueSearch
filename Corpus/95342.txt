 URL : "https://github.com/humhub/humhub/issues/2718" TITLE : cron job on ovh's servers. BODY : hello. managing cron tasks on ovh servers is disastrous and does not allow you to use the settings. is it possible to have a command type cronhourly.php and crondaily.php to work around this problem please? or if not, would you have a workaround? thank you in advance for your feedback. regards, sam
