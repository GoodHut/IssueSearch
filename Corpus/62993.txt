 URL : "https://github.com/Nethereum/Nethereum/issues/115" TITLE : dapp options for quorum BODY : hello, i am trying to post offline transactions to a quorum chain setup in azure. i can see that a vm is created with a public ip address which runs the 7 node geth instances. can you please suggest how i can use nethereum from another server to post offline transactions? does this require geth installed on the other node? if geth is running in my local domain as an observer how do i get this node to post offline transactions to the quorum network? many thanks.
