 URL : "https://github.com/lodash/lodash/issues/3411" TITLE : tonumber null returns 0 BODY : the _tonumber_ function returns nan if given undefined or a string that doesn't parse as a number. and, as expected, tonumber 1 and tonumber 0 return true and false respectively. however, i was extremely surprised to find out that tonumber null returns 0 . in my understanding, null means no value provided , which is quite distinct from the value zero. for example, if you're working with the value of a currency field in an api response, you might expect the value to be a valid number or a number as a string or null. i might use tonumber cashamount to make sure i was working with a number value before doing arithmetic. this could be extremely problematic for obvious reasons. is this the intended behaviour of the function? and, if so, why? if not, i'm happy to submit a pr fixing it.
