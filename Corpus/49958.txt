 URL : "https://github.com/PRUNERS/FLiT/issues/30" TITLE : use the new schmoo.py BODY : the schmoo plot logic has been copied into an external python file instead of a stored routine. this requires less permissions and the output file will be owned by the user rather than the postgres account. this can be important if the user is different from the admin who setup the tool. also, it is for ease of use, and does not require the python module that allows access to python within a postgres stored procedure. the downside to this is that it would not be contained in a single transaction. but the schmoo.py algorithm can be simplified to only require one query to the database so that it is in a single transaction and perform logic in python rather than in the database.
