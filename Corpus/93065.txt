 URL : "https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-admin/issues/436" TITLE : add config options to docs BODY : while writing 435 i noticed that, while jekyll admin has a dedicated page for its documentation https://jekyll.github.io/jekyll-admin/ , this page does not have a page covering what config settings can be used in _config.yml . readme.md provides a sample config for hiding links. it is not clear if this is the complete set of config options currently available since readmes often only show a brief overview, reserving the complete extent of features for the docs . even if hidden_links is currently the only option for jekyll admin that you can use in _config.yml , having a dedicated config page in the docs would make it easier for users to verify.
