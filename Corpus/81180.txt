BODY : hi, here a pseudo code of what i'm doing to initialized the chat: swift smooch.initwith sktsettings apptoken: <my app token> if let lcurrent = sktuser.current { lcurrent.firstname = lfirstname lcurrent.lastname = llastname lcurrent.email = lemail smooch.show } lfirstname , llastname and lemail are variables initialized with the application info. i don't need to register users on smooch. but the support just needs to know with which user they are discussing. but when i set the user info the chat displayed the message could not connect to server . this gives the impression that we are not connected. since there are no other messages afterwards we do not know if the chat is finally connected.
