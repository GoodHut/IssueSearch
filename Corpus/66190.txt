 URL : "https://github.com/angular/material2/issues/2762" TITLE : md-select default value BODY : bug, feature request, or proposal: when using formbuilder default value passed to formbuilder does not show as selected in md-select. what is the expected behavior? if i select value in formbuilder its name and value should appear as selected option of md-select. what is the current behavior? placeholder is displayed instead. what are the steps to reproduce? typescript: this.editform = this.formbuilder.group { projectid: this.task.project._id } ; or: this.editform = this.formbuilder.group { projectid: new formcontrol {value: this.task.project._id}, validators.required } ; html: <form layout= column formgroup = editform ngsubmit = savetask task ><md-select formcontrolname= projectid name= project placeholder= {{'form.project' | translate }} ><md-option ngfor= let project of projects | async value = project._id >{{project.name}}</md-option></md-select><select formcontrolname= projectid name= project ><option ngfor= let project of projects | async value = project._id >{{project.name}}</option></select></form> standard html works, md does't what is the use-case or motivation for changing an existing behavior? edit forms. lets have a class with 20 attributes each of them can be changed using one form. you don't want to refill all these attributes if you want to change just one. which versions of angular, material, os, browsers are affected? angular 2.2.1 material 2.0.0-beta.1 win 10 vivaldi firefox tested but probably all affected is there anything else we should know?
