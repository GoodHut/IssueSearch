 URL : "https://github.com/SamVerschueren/listr/issues/59" TITLE : better parameter handling BODY : for the longest time, i was debugging an issue which was finally fixed by replacing: new listr { title, task }, { title, task } with new listr { title, task }, { title, task } notice the difference? listr wasn't doing anything in the first instance, i couldn't think of anything better to say than it doesn't work , no output, no errors, nothing, just a no-op... and so it took so long to debug.
