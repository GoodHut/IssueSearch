 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/cordova-plugin-code-push/issues/204" TITLE : question about plugins BODY : since code-push doesn't update native code like plugins, then, if you release a new version of an app with a new plugin, and then code-push some changes to production, is there a way to make sure that it only reaches only the new version? otherwise it seems like if you use any plugin code, it will break all older versions of the app.
