 URL : "https://github.com/futurepress/epub.js/issues/615" TITLE : toc not sourced correctly BODY : the other day i download the new epub reader livre and released that the toc levels are not displayed correctly for all books this issue is also described here https://github.com/livrereader/livre/issues/20 . i then cloned the epub.js repo and adjusted the simple example to load the two books listed below: 1. beginning scala apress 2. learning pentaho c-tools packtpub for the first one the toc levels are shown correctly in livre, whereas for the second one everything is in the top level. the main difference i could see when testing this with the plain epub.js setup is that for the second book when you call gettoc , for each element the subitems array is empty. then i extracted the toc file from the epub file and compared them, but couldn't find anything immediately obvious other than that one is using an xml namespace whereas the other one isn't . please let me know if i should provide these files i won't be able to provide the epub file since these are bought books, but i am happy to share the internal toc file .
