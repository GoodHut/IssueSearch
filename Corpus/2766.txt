 URL : "https://github.com/mattjj/pyhsmm/issues/84" TITLE : doi for code? BODY : thanks for sharing your amazing library. we will be using it in an article, and in addition to citing the johnson 2013 article we would also like to cite the code itself. just adding https://github.com/mattjj/pyhsmm is an option, but it may be nicer if there was a doi, see how to https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/ have you considered adding a doi? thanks, vincent
