 URL : "https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/4075" TITLE : better commands for themes BODY : hi, would it be possible to add new commands or update the old commands to work better with themes? right now to create a new theme, you first need to create a new site with hugo new site and then inside that site, you can create a new theme with hugo new theme . this is fine if you're making a site, but if you're making a standalone theme which you intend to share on https://themes.gohugo.io then you also need an examplesite directory inside your theme directory so it's a bit redundant to have a site inside a theme inside another site so i was thinking why not eliminate the site at the top? this is what i've been doing and to run the theme, i am using the following alias: alias hugo-serve-theme= hugo serve --source=examplesite --themesdir=../.. it would be really nice if this was built into hugo it could be called something like hugo serve theme and also if the hugo new theme command was updated such that if it is called inside a directory that isn't a site then it should create an empty theme with an empty site in the examplesite folder. i think this would encourage people to create more standalone themes meant to be used by multiple sites and shared on https://themes.gohugo.io instead of creating local themes used by only one site.
