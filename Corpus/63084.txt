 URL : "https://github.com/iNecas/foreman_maintain/issues/12" TITLE : define order for checks BODY : define which check executes in what order. maybe an extra metadata or a configuration file to list down the checks in numerical order. mostly beneficial for users/customers. _pros_: 1. categorize the type of checks. 2. can be customized by users. 3. easy to go with an offline checklist. _cons_: 1. extra configuration apart from existing foreman configs not sure how many are there 2. user intervention results in educating the users/cu. this could be a good to have feature.
