 URL : "https://github.com/sequelpro/sequelpro/issues/2731" TITLE : mysql connection overhaul BODY : redesign threading architecture to reduce crashes and edge case bugs, and gracefully handle slow and unreliable connections. a layer of abstraction needs to be added to the model that the ui can talk to on the main thread and always receive an immediate response, while server communication happens on a background operation queue - and the ui is updated once new data is available.
