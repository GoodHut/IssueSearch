 URL : "https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-js-helpers/issues/46" TITLE : logout - azure ad? BODY : following advice from 41 on logout, i implemented logout of azure ad using this code: function logout { window.location.replace https://login.microsoftonline.com/ + tenant + /oauth2/logout?post_logout_redirect_uri= + encodeuricomponent location.origin + location.pathname ; } this takes me to the azure ad logout page and seems to be doing logoff... then i'm redirected to the post_logout_redirect_uri, which is my main page from spa office web addins, and the following calls are made again: authenticator.endpoints.registerazureadauth ... authenticator.authenticate officehelpers.defaultendpoints.azuread this brings up the azure ad login dialog, which immediately closes and reauthenticates with same user... so i'm unable to login with a different user, and entering a loop of login/logout... am i missing something here? do i need to also clear cookies or localstorage or sessionstorage or else? where are the tokens saved? can i delete them from my code? thanks
