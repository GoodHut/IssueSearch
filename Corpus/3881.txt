 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/xaml-standard/issues/147" TITLE : .net core xaml BODY : very good project, thanks for the unification. i hope that this might lead to a new universal .net core xaml in future xaml standard versions. also, all the frameworks that are getting into this, be easily open-sourced, to have other developers lend a hand and speed development, and increase the number of features. regards.
