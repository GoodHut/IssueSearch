 URL : "https://github.com/dweidenfeld/plexdrive/issues/273" TITLE : stuck in setup loop BODY : i ran plexdrive for the first time but inadvertently transposed the client id & client secret when responding to the prompts. the url generated is then invalid. the problem is that re-running plexdrive i don't get prompted for the client id or client secret again i just get prompted with the bogus url & asked to paste the authorization code that i should have obtained from the correct url. i can't find any way out of this loop. there is not yet a config file. where is the token that indicates to plexdrive that setup hasn't been completed? how do i reset so that i can run plexdrive config from the start?
