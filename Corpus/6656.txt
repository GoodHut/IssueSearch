 URL : "https://github.com/HenokZewdie/ResumeServlet/issues/1" TITLE : arraylist to db BODY : converting the arraylist into string and store in the database using iterator or for loop is possible. but mr. anton told me that its not recommended. my new approach is get the auto increment personid immediately after the insert statement then hold as a session variable the will insert education, experiance and skill using the sessionpersonid. insert into tbl where personid = sessionpersonid
