 URL : "https://github.com/itemir/thundersec/issues/31" TITLE : too many mails are marked BODY : hello, if the second hop is an smpt with spf the first ip should be ignored. the tools is screaming spam here and there because the dailin ip was somehow somewhere some day listed years ago. of course dailins are bad. but we mostly use them and are misused by others. spamhaus, slurb, baracuda and spamcop are really bad/not managed sources. a mail was marked as junk because of 1 attempt in 2003 for this one dailin ip. by the way, our domain has spf and they are mostly marked. something is not right in this extension. michael
