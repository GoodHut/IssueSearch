 URL : "https://github.com/frol/docker-alpine-gcc/issues/1" TITLE : g++ no longer included BODY : if you're going to separate g++ into its own image, you need to tell the community before you do so. our company was going to deploy with this image. we were using g++ with this image, and all of a sudden our tests started failing, and we didn't know why. i had to come to this github page, and by chance saw the commit message on the readme. there would have been no other way that i know of to know that you were removing g++ from this image.
