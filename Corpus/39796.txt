 URL : "https://github.com/haxetink/tink_web/issues/47" TITLE : strange typing error BODY : haxe interface api { @:post public function post body:{id:string} :promise<{var id default, never :string;}>; } this is throwing me some incompatible accessor error. something about never should be default . what i guess is that somewhere in tink_macro doesn't distinguish the two types. maybe somewhere around directtype.
