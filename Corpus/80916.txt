 URL : "https://github.com/MattClarkson/CMakeCatchTemplate/issues/16" TITLE : use vtks opengl2 backend BODY : i want to test this out specifically for mac. 1. according to https://blog.kitware.com/new-opengl-rendering-in-vtk/, this was merged on june 20, 2014, so we would need at least vtk version 6.3. in vtk 6.3, both opengl and opengl2 backends should be present. 2. at ucl, im currently using qt 5.4.2 for mitk based projects, using a fork of mitk 2015.5.2. but qt changed their opengl significantly in 5.5, and mitk/master now has a minimum qt 5.6. so, the target it qt 5.6 or newer. 3. when i first compiled this project with qt 5.6, i got issues on mac, similar to: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/7606, and further googling suggests we may need to specify a minimum mac sdk or xtools version.
