 URL : "https://github.com/BIDeveloperExtensions/bideveloperextensions/issues/16" TITLE : cannot remove bidshelper BODY : hi, i installed the bidshelper vs add-on for vs2015 and it started causing my vs to lock up every time i right-clicked in solution explorer. so, i attempted to remove it first using the extensions manager which didn't remove it completely then actually trying to hunt down all the different components and manually deleting them. there are apparently still some components left on my machine and they are still causing vs to screw up. this is the case even after i've done a complete reinstall of vs. please advise exactly where you install all these components and how you register them with vs so i can truly remove your software from my computer. thank you. -yl
