 URL : "https://github.com/gpodder/gpodder/issues/331" TITLE : unknown podcast from xxxx BODY : i was having big problems when using gpodder alongside antennapod where feeds were becoming duplicated https://github.com/antennapod/antennapod/issues/2267 . i tracked this down to the bbc changing their urls and thus gpodder assuming that these were new podcasts: http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p002vsnk/episodes/downloads.rss became http://podcasts.files.bbci.co.uk/p002vsnk.rss the former simply redirects to the latter now. i have been through most of my podcasts which used the old format and resubscribed using the new url. however, all of the new urls result in an 'unknown podcast from xxxx' on gpodder.net whilst antennapod can interpret the feeds perfectly, titles and images etc. ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2161844/28489990-78562408-6f02-11e7-941b-44e238e23438.png i've seen this bug mentioned in antennapod here https://github.com/antennapod/antennapod/issues/771 and it was stated that: > we take the title from the rss/atom feed, not from gpodder.net itself. we do not sync any feed information apart from the feed's/episode's url which are used as identifiers with this being the case, what is antennapod doing that gpodder.net is not which enables it to recognise the title and image? i'm happy to send you anything that might help identify the issue, as a donator i am just keen to see this awesome project succeed.
