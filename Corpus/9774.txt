 URL : "https://github.com/gotev/android-upload-service/issues/227" TITLE : add doze support BODY : doze mode in some cases will override partial wake locks/network requests and enter doze even when the service performing the network request is running in a foreground service. specifically a foreground service can enter doze mode if the activity is also in the foreground. you can read about this issue: https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=193802 c14 and https://commonsware.com/blog/2015/11/18/another-doze-edge-case-foreground.html sounds like google's recommendation is to run the foreground service in a different process. there is an exhaustive thread discussing the issue in detail at https://plus.google.com/+androiddevelopers/posts/94jckmg4jff. specifically the posts by dianne hackborn.
