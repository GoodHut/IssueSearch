 URL : "https://github.com/EMGD-Community/intel-binaries-linux/issues/45" TITLE : installing emgd on debian? BODY : with issue 33 being mistakenly asked and then closed the issue being resolved by the user realizing the psb_gfx driver served his needs , i was wondering myself whether it's possible to use emgd on debian. i see that there's a folder ./debian , which seems to contain files like control and rules which are known for being used for compilation of debian packages, but are there any usage instructions, precompiled packages, or has anyone even used them? i'd be interested in testing this out, see if i can't revitalize this ao751h netbook with a fresh stretch desktop installation..
