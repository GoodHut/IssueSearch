 URL : "https://github.com/openthread/openthread/issues/1516" TITLE : rfc: coap option update BODY : i've found few issues with coap option handling, so i plan on pr'ing few changes, but before that i would like some input on it. chages would be as follows: - add otcoapheadergetfirstoption - this allows for the application to do it's processing e.g. query options . - remove otcoapheadergetcurrentoption - it becomes redundant. - in server::processreceivedmessage, in option parsing change default unknown option behavior from exitnow , to break i.e. continue parsing options . this is the second change needed to allow for the application to parse options. my primary concern is with the default behavior in processreceivedmessage. was it chosen for any particular reason?
