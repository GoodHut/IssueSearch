 URL : "https://github.com/FTSRG/ingraph/issues/249" TITLE : add eager operations BODY : we have so many constraints in some queries that optimizing the min full is unfeasible. look at this https://github.com/ftsrg/ingraph/blob/master/sre/test/ingraph/sre/queries/connectedsegments_test.clj . some of them are satisfied only by operations that are trivial. as costs are based on cardinality, this means that the op will never modify cardinality. currently these are : bindconstant, property. bindconstant will be dealt with in another way see 248 , but in general instead of the usual cost-based optimization they could be chosen as soon as they become available. this means that there will be less branching during planning. also, some other operations, that are not trivial should be changed to eager, to lessen the branching: genbinaryassertion and genunaryassertion
