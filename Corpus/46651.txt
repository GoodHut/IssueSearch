 URL : "https://github.com/PG85/OTGEdit/issues/3" TITLE : missing settings tabs BODY : i seem to be having an issue with the application where the tabs for world and biome settings are not showing up. i assume they're supposed to based on the cursory glance at your code, and that it's not because they haven't been implemented yet in 1.0.13. i can't get them to appear no matter the scale, and even reopening it doesn't help. i'm on windows 7, fairly old hardware, wouldn't be surprised if it's just me... screenshot attached. ! otgednotabs https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10701284/32985701-865fdd5e-cc7d-11e7-9458-dac90de12d86.png
