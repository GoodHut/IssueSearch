 URL : "https://github.com/stax76/staxrip/issues/201" TITLE : mp4box stopped working BODY : hello there i recently started using your program. today i found a bug i think . with default settings when you try to encode x265 in mp4 container mp4box gets error 0xc0000005 but when i remove tags from container options it works perfectly. as far as i know mp4 does not support tags in x265, that might be the reason it crashes.
