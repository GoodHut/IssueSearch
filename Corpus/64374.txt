 URL : "https://github.com/libp2p/go-peerstream/issues/5" TITLE : garbage collect streams BODY : currently, we only garbage collect streams when connections are closed or the stream is manually closed locally. we should either not track streams makes debugging hard , garbage collect them at some interval as we do with connections groan , or use a notification system work . we should also clean up the notifications interface as closedstream doesn't really make sense in a world with half-open streams.
