from: david nowak &lt;<pgh1velx7sto66y@jetable.net>&gt; in v8.2beta3, the command make html was generating html documentation with all the links. in v8.2beta4, only the links to the standard library are generated : bugzilla comment id: 2424

from: jean-marc notin &lt;<notin@lix.polytechnique.fr>&gt; i made some tests to reproduce the bug, but i did not experienced the problem you describe. it may be useful if you give us more information, e.g. the options you passed to coq_makefile when generating the makefile or the log of the execution of 'make html' to see the options passed to coqc and to coqdoc . bugzilla comment id: 2436

from: jean-marc notin &lt;<notin@lix.polytechnique.fr>&gt; the bug happens only with projects that contains subdirectories and without a -r option. in this case, there is a mismatch between the module name in the .glob file and the one guessed by coqdoc... i intend to fix it very soon; it should be available in the next beta|stable release of coq 8.2. in the meantime, you can use a -r option instead of -i to avoid the problem... bugzilla comment id: 7230

from: @_pirbo in coq trunk -i lives in the caml world and you should use -q if you want non recursive include of a directory of coq files.
coqdoc undertand -q and therefore i think this bug is finally closed.
