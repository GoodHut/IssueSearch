BODY : hi, firstly, great work on this. it seems to be an awesome project, and just what i was looking for but unfortunately i simply can't get it to work! i have followed the readme instructions a dozen times and i cannot get the pc to initialize the head unit. i feel that it is a driver issue that i'm having. the last time i tried, i uninstalled then changed the drivers with the unit initilazed via the tts4 software. this seemed to work correctly. i followed all the instructions but the gui said -trainer not found and the green light wouldn't come on on the head unit. is it possible that avg is interfering with my programme? iv'e had lots of virus warnings about the folder that antifier is held in? ! imag0410 1 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34662086/34127469-29be5a60-e435-11e7-8298-f97a154368f3.jpg i hope i'm doing something daft?! thanks in advance andy
