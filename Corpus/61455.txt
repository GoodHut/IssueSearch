 URL : "https://github.com/jakubgarfield/Bonobo-Git-Server/issues/767" TITLE : auditing feature broken BODY : the push audit feature isn't working. i'm certain this is due to the removal of the unity decorator extension by 985a98e2328ff02d8c8829dccb43883fef79b1bd @redx2501 . this causes none of the other igitservice implementations to work because they're meant decorate each other and thus gives the auditing code no chance to be executed at all. apparently the decorator caused a bit of trouble before, as stated by this comment https://github.com/jakubgarfield/bonobo-git-server/blob/master/bonobo.git.server/global.asax.cs l132-l140 , but even though it was removed, the comment and implementation there wasn't changed. so i wonder if it was actually intended to remove the decorator? is there a purposed replacement for it? if not, i'd suggest to revert that commit to get the auditing functionality back.
