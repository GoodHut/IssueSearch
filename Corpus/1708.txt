 URL : "https://github.com/linode/python-linode-api/issues/78" TITLE : dns and rdns BODY : if i create dns record with domain.create_record and then try to set rdns property for ip address i get 400: no match was found for '<my domain name here>'. reverse dns must have a matching forward entry.; i think it may be because dns records are not replicated yet. it is not clear how long to wait for replication. maybe you will check against internal dns database first while validating rdns? or maybe if dns record is created for existing server rdns will be created automatically?
