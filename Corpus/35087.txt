 URL : "https://github.com/vincentmorneau/material-apex/issues/305" TITLE : datepicker in dialog BODY : i know it's a long shot due to absolute positioning but is it possible to have datepicker appear outside of a dialog at least modal . the main issue is the size, as i have dialogs smaller than datepicker.
