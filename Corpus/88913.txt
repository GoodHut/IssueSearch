 URL : "https://github.com/tgomilar/paroller.js/issues/1" TITLE : paroller install question BODY : paroller seems to be exactly what i have been looking for. i am having trouble installing/getting to work. i've enqueued the script and see it in my page source. i understand i have to add the data attributes to the element. i can see them when in inspect the front end. where you offer the via javascript method of usage, is that in addition to via data-attribute both js and data-attribute are needed or is using js an alternative to using data-attribute on the element in cases where a data attribute can't be added via html ? step 3 of your install guide confuses me. thx for help.
