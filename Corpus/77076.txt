 URL : "https://github.com/ScalaWilliam/ActionFPS/issues/283" TITLE : mix team for tournaments BODY : we need to be able to accept mixed teams for tournaments, this would probably double the number of participant. for example : w00p are not available to play this week but i want to play, subjective is available so we create a team. but since we are not an official clan we can't play. how can we do this ?
