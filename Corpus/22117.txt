 URL : "https://github.com/mbunkus/mkvtoolnix/issues/2168" TITLE : improper shut down BODY : when i'm using mkvtoolnix gui, and the app is left open then the computer is shut down/rebooted or the app is otherwise improperly closed, when it is reopened it will redo completed tasks. i don't know if it keeping the settings that were used for the completed task so i abort the job and redo it manually again. running on windows 10 pro, build 1709 x64, did the same thing on 1703 x64. to recreate it should be pretty straight forward complete a job leave app open reboot computer open app
