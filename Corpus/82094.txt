 URL : "https://github.com/gimoh/docker-pureftpd/issues/6" TITLE : add explizit ftp over tls BODY : is it possible to add certificate-files including intermediate certificate and to turn on ftp over tls as the only possibility to access the container additionally to virtual-users-only? that would be great, but i am not into alpine enough to try it without any hints and i was already fighting with https://github.com/stilliard/docker-pure-ftpd/issues/48 and the debian pureftpd-wrapper... with debian as base, there are some other obstacles it cannot be taken from the debian-packages and has to be build , so alpine seems to be the better choice here; but adding tls is easy on debian: copy ./ssl/pure-ftpd.pem /etc/ssl/private/pure-ftpd.pem turns on tls, but i think not only tls. i would like to force tls only, too. and a second question: if i'd like to pass -c 5, -c 5 and other options, do i have to add them to my docker-compose.yml in the environment-section or do i have to write an additional dockerfile for this image with a script that starts the pureftp-daemon in the container, which has to be copied into the container before? thanks a lot for your docker-image! sincerely, jochen
