 URL : "https://github.com/atmos/hubot-deploy/issues/127" TITLE : hubot not sending requests BODY : hi. i have deployed my hubot and my heaven app https://github.com/atmos/heaven in heroku. in slack, if i try to deploy a branch that does not exist or any other invalid data , hubot tells me about it. however, if the project specified is one of the projects inside apps, i got no feedback. look's like hubot is not sending any request... i think i probably did something wrong, but hubot shows me no errors in the logs
