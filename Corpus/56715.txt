 URL : "https://github.com/Skrylar/firebird/issues/1" TITLE : note to initial commit BODY : great effort to wrap the fbclient tried to compile with nim c ex01.nim on linux. ibase.h was not picked up initially but was ok when i gave it the full path {.passl: -lfbembed .} failed , after commenting out i get this: /data5/nimtests/firebird/examples/nimcache/ex01.o: in function nimmainmodule': ex01.c: .text+0x168 : undefined reference to isc_dsql_execute_immediate' ex01.c: .text+0x18e : undefined reference to isc_commit_transaction' ex01.c: .text+0x19d : undefined reference to isc_detach_database' collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status in firebird3 there is no libfbembed.so , i think embedded connections are via libengine12.so which is set in the configuration files. in case you continue this effort it might be best to connect with the firebird developers at https://www.firebirdsql.org https://www.firebirdsql.org via their developers mailing-list. i am sure they are able and happy to answer any current and upcoming questions. maybe some of this manuals will help too: https://www.firebirdsql.org/en/reference-manuals/ https://www.firebirdsql.org/en/reference-manuals/ my current solution https://github.com/qqtop/nimfirebird https://github.com/qqtop/nimfirebird is via the python driver , but in the long run a pure nim driver is the way to go. the firebird community is actually quite large and active in brasil,russia,germany and czech.
