 URL : "https://github.com/boltstack/boltstack/issues/1" TITLE : goals / roadmap BODY : needs work: these are the steps that are needed for a stable release to 1.0 obviously, this is not oss, so versioning sounds a bit funny. i would, however, like to somewhat version this org and it's repos. version 1.0 should support: backend - node | rest - node | graphql - go | rest - go | graphql - rust | rest - rust | graphql - c | .net | rest - c | .net | graphql frontend - react | redux | rxjs | consume a rest api - react | relay | rxjs | consume a graphql api - react | apollo | rxjs | consume a graphql api - angular | redux | rxjs | consume a rest api - angular | apollo | rxjs | consume a graphql api - vue | rest - vue | graphql native - swift mac/ios - android - react native ios/android - windows desktop extra: - master branch should always be the simplest version of that language/framework. this will typically be vanilla. - each version should live in a short and descriptive branch. - each backend should support 3 databases at minimum. - each backend should support both rest and graphql, where possible. - each backend should be agnostic of the frontend, and vice-versa, allowing developers to plug-and-play with any supported stack. - each frontend should consume a single ui/sass/scss/css framework. no need to write styles over and over again. - each repo should have a full suite of tests. - each repo should have proper docker setup that works across mac, windows, and linux. - each backend and frontend should be production-ready, including multi-stage environments. local, dev, staging, prod - we should probably make sure we are not in copyright violation.
