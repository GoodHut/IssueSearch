 URL : "https://github.com/MatrexsVigil/harvestcraft/issues/253" TITLE : incorrect variable name BODY : i noticed today that my translation of grapes did not appear though i had translated it into french in fr_fr.lang it seems that the variable name in the .lang files does not match the variable name used for all things related to grapes in the mod the fruit, the seed and the plant . in the .lang file it is written: item.gjerkitem.name item.gjerkseeditem.name item.gjerkjuiceitem.name item.gjerkjellyitem.name item.gjerksaladitem.name tile.pamgjerkcrop.name the last one should be tile.pamgrapecrop.name, but i'm not sure about the others.
