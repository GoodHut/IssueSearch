 URL : "https://github.com/mapbox/leaflet-omnivore/issues/103" TITLE : mapbox gl support BODY : hi, i have happily used mapbox and omnivore together on my personal site for a couple years. they make a fantastic pair and i was hoping to continue using omnivore while switching to mapbox gl. since omnivore is advertised as a glue library, i assumed its geojson output can be consumed by mapboxgl as well, but i can't quite figure out the incantation to get it working. i see some hardcoded references to l.geojson in omnivore when no additional args are given to the parsing function. since layer is something that can be passed in, i thought maybe i could override but nothing i tried seems to be working. code-wise, i'm basically using the omnivore example found here: https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/example/v1.0.0/omnivore-kml-tooltip/
