 URL : "https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/smart_open/issues/134" TITLE : streaming zipfile content BODY : i need to read or stream a zipfile content from the s3 bucket. my usual workflow was download the zipfile to my ec2 instance and then run a python script with the zipfile module to read its content without extracting the zipfile. however, i would like to start streaming directly from s3 to save disk space. do you think smart_open library can help me with my use case? thanks.
