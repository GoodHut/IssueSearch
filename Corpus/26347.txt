 URL : "https://github.com/NucleusPowered/Nucleus/issues/692" TITLE : api event additions BODY : it would be useful if the nucleus api added events for: - an extended banuserevent to be able to listen to nucleus' special bans like nameban and tempban - a muteuserevent to listen to mutes being set and expiring - a warnuserevent of course there's many more i could add to this list, but these are the most prevalent to my immediate integration needs : keep up the great work!
