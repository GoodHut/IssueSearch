 URL : "https://github.com/tutao/tutanota/issues/194" TITLE : u2f support for firefox BODY : the addition of u2f to the new tutanota client is really great. unfortunately it still does not seem to support firefox, even though firefox now has u2f support built-in. it would be great if the firefox support could be added. unfortunately i was not able to dig into the code and identify how this could be achieved. i would be willing to invest some time if i was given some directions. since this is security sensitive i would appreciate it however, if someone with more expertise would engage with this issue.
