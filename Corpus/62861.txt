 URL : "https://github.com/hydrosquall/SpheroTeam/issues/5" TITLE : create spheroteam class BODY : investigate whether a python class which wraps the spheromanager base class and extends it with the functionality in this library would improve the library's usability. it would wrap up the tracker and the camera objects so that those don't need to be managed separately, and it would store the variables that i have floating around offsets , traceablefilter , traceablecolor , teamcolors , etc inside the main object. this way someone could instantiate a team with the following commands, and be ready to focus purely on the team coordination problem! it would still let the individual robots be accessible via team._spheros , but it would encourage team-oriented thinking. will review of software architecture design principles to determine whether this would actually improve productivity- get some feedback from potential research collaborators before making the switch. python team = spheroteam configfile team.connect_team list of available bots team.initialize_camera cameraid' team.calibrate
