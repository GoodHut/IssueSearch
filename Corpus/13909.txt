 URL : "https://github.com/lcnetdev/marc2bibframe2/issues/54" TITLE : 856 item creation BODY : from @ntra00: i think there’s a problem with 856s. http://lx2.loc.gov:210/lcdb?query=rec.id=10063988&recordschema=bibframe2&maximumrecords=1 http://id.loc.gov/tools/bibframe/compare-id/full-ttl?find=10063988 http://id.loc.gov/tools/bibframe/compare-id/full-rdf?find=10063988 the work has an instance for the 856 856-22 . and it has an instance for the main instance, instance . the 856 instance embedded in the work has an item for itself, item856-22 on the main instance, there are 2 hasitems, item050-13 and and item for the 856 again. item856-22 i think that’s wrong, and the 856 item should only be on its own instance. i have not checked the spec. thanks,nate
