 URL : "https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/issues/2554" TITLE : piwik analytics support BODY : when using cbioportal on local intranet it doesn't make much sense and it can leak sensitive information to use google analytics. to avoid this we are using an open source alternative - piwik http://www.piwik.org which can be deployed locally. it would be nice if cbioportal supported piwik so that even intranet instances can have analytics.
