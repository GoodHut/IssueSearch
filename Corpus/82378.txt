 URL : "https://github.com/python-gitlab/python-gitlab/issues/390" TITLE : add support for subgroups BODY : gitlab 10.3 introduces functionality to get a groups subgroups https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/api/groups.html list-a-groups-s-subgroups . i would like to have this supported in the python api. this functionality is quite essential, because in gitlab 10.3, it now only lists the 'root' groups with gitlab.groups.list all_available=true , so using the python-gitlab api it is no longer possible to get access to subgroups if you don't know their exact names.
