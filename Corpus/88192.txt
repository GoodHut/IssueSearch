 URL : "https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/issues/1790" TITLE : move to python 3.5 or 3.6 BODY : it will happen eventually. the point of this bug is to determine what are the conditions on doing the transition. afaict this is a matter of needing to support lts releases and such. some distros and their versions: - ubuntu xenial, 3.5 - ubuntu trusty, 3.4. - debian jessie 3.4 - debian stretch 3.5 - rhel 6 ??? does not ship python 3 at all? - rhel 7 ??? - sles 11 ??? - sles 12 ??? i don't have a good grasp on what people actually need to support and for how long. please write your requirements below so we can make an informed decision as opposed to me saying debian sid should be stable enough for everybody .
