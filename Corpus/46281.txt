 URL : "https://github.com/JuliaParallel/ClusterManagers.jl/issues/72" TITLE : lsf manager with bsub BODY : hello, are there plans to write a manager for lsf/bsub? if so, would it be able to use the infiniband transport for example. i managed to hack a bsub submission to print out its hostnames and then use the sshmanager in julia to connect to those. my experience on these fronts is limited, and have had trouble connecting :all_to_all if the nodes happen to be on different racks. i tried to mimic the qsub.jl with very limited success : cheers!
