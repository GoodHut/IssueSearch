 URL : "https://github.com/YousicianGit/UnityMenuSystem/issues/3" TITLE : hard coded menu navigation BODY : is there a good reason for hard-coding menu navigation into each menu type? for example the mainmenu class has: public void onoptionspressed { optionsmenu.show ; } however, allowing you to actually define which menu you want to go to using an argument would allow you to freely setup navigate to any menu you want in the editor, without having to create an explicit method for each navigation you need. something like this instead: public void goto menu menu { menu.show ; } are these explicit navigation methods just done to enforce a specific menu flow and prevent certain types of issues?
