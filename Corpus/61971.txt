 URL : "https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi/issues/404" TITLE : can not ssh into octopi BODY : i have been unable to ssh in from the beginning. whenever i had to do something directly on the pi i would just plug in a screen and keyboard to access the command line. whenever i try to ssh octopi.local or its ip address i get the following- user$ ssh octopi.local connection reset by fe80::1a7b:6a10:51d4:d0a5%en1 then if i try a few times it changes to this- user$ ssh octopi.local connection closed by fe80::1a7b:6a10:51d4:d0a5%en1 and the same if i use the ip. i have tried adding 'ssh' to the sd card but that did not help.
