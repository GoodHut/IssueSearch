 URL : "https://github.com/clearcontainers/proxy/issues/52" TITLE : add a logcontrol command BODY : it may be nice to control the amount of logging remotely maybe only if the proxy has been started with a debug option to avoid clients abusing of that facility and spam logs . controls could have filters to further select the container we're interested in. eg. { level : debug , containerid : xxxxxxxx } would only output debug messages for messages tagged with the provided containerid
