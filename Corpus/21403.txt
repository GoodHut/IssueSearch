 URL : "https://github.com/SparkDevNetwork/Rock/issues/2210" TITLE : feature site icons BODY : for a long time we've been wanting to add a property to the site model to allow for the easy configuration of a site icon aka favicon . there's a lot of different ways to do this so i thought before we implemented it we should get some input. i've played with a few wordpress themes and this is what they typically do. 1. allow you to upload a square image. 2. they then use that image to insert this markup into the head <link rel= icon href= http://server.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cropped-image-32x32.jpg sizes= 32x32 > i was thinking we'd do the same but add several different sizes using rock's image resizing capabilities. planning on supporting: - 16x16 - 32x32 - 57x57 - 144x144 - 152x152 having this markup seems to override the presence of the favicon.ico in the webserver root in my testing on chrome and ie @garrettjohnson @cabal95
