 URL : "https://github.com/boulis/Castalia/issues/6" TITLE : manual parameter names BODY : reported by inhwan kim <hwanud@gmail.com> in the forum. the recent manual from the website has a typo when describing the use of collision model. it says a user has to set the parameter like the below: .... setting the parameter sn.node .communication.radio.collisionmodel .... and goes on ... pg. 64 however, it is wrong and does not work, because the statement is case sensitive. i also tried to found why the setting does not work through this forum, but some of those answers used lower case for communication . of course, the first use of that parameter is correctly specified by using upper case for the communication on page 19. so someone's code is working and the others' not working. you can find the reason from the ned file for the node which can be found at src/node/node.ned . since it defines the module as communication by using upper case, we should follow the rule to make it correctly work. to sum up, if you want to use collisionmodel parameter of communication.radio submodule, please check communication is written upper case!
