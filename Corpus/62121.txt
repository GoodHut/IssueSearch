 URL : "https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb-server/issues/255" TITLE : cannot replicate _users BODY : i've been fighting this for hours now, still can't figure this out and cannot seem to find a solution on the internet anywhere...or anybody mentioning the same issue. i am running express-pouchdb on a vps. works great, all is fine, my appswork perfectly. this instance contains some databases, all is well. now i try to setup a local replica of the instance for debugging and testing. i can replicate all databases from the vps to my local node server, except for _users setup: running the latest express-pouchdb, express, pouchdb 6.3.4 _users, contains some users. no partymode, have config.json with admin credentials stored. myotherdb, has roles assigned for reading/writing. i can perfectly replicate all databases cors work, authentication works etc etc. but as soon as i try to replicate _users one way replication, no syncing , it returns an error, without details... i replicate with admin credentials { ok: false, start_time: 2017-07-24t08:26:24.454z, docs_read: 0, docs_written: 0, doc_write_failures: 0, errors: , status: 'aborting', end_time: 2017-07-24t08:26:24.970z, last_seq: 0 } i tried setting checkpoint: false, since: 1 if i do a https://myserver/_users/_all_docs , i can see the correct contents of my database. still no clue... i even tried it in a browser script...not working there either. i'm sure it has something to do with the fact that the _users db is some special db, with it's own working. any help would be greatly appreciated
