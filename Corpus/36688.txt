 URL : "https://github.com/luberda-molinet/FFImageLoading/issues/447" TITLE : image loading failed BODY : hi i am using ffimageloading in an android application. i want to show some images i download from the web in a viewpager. i have used the code that is given in the official documentation using viewpager with ffimageloading. if i wait for the first image to be downloaded everything works flawlessly. but if i scroll to another one before the first one gets loaded then it throws a dispatchexceptioninfo and every retry count, delay fails. i have tried changing the retrycount and retrydelay but it didn't work. do you have any idea what it might be wrong? i use the following code: public class carouselfragment : android.support.v4.app.fragment { private readonly string _image; public carouselfragment {} public carouselfragment string image { _image = image; } public override view oncreateview layoutinflater inflater, viewgroup container, bundle savedinstancestate { // use this to return your custom view for this fragment // return inflater.inflate resource.layout.yourfragment, container, false ; var rootview = inflater.inflate resource.layout.fragment_carousel, null, false ; var imgbackground = rootview.findviewbyid<imageviewasync> resource.id.imgcarousel ; imageservice.instance.loadurl _image, timespan.fromminutes 5 .retry 3, 200 .fadeanimation true, true .into imgbackground ; return rootview; } }
