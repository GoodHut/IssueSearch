 URL : "https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-phishing-detect/issues/487" TITLE : etherdelta is phishing? BODY : hey, when i tried to enter etherdelta i got denied acces by my metamask extension saying it tested positve on the ethereum phishing detector. i haven't been on etherdelta for a while so maybe i missed something but i have done trades on it a couple weeks ago and i have had no problems with it then. so is this a error of metamask or really phishing?
