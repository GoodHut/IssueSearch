 URL : "https://github.com/coreos/tectonic-installer/issues/1595" TITLE : terraform use case issue. BODY : versions tectonic version 1.6.7 terraform version 9.11 platform aws : what happened? using a pattern like: repro.zip https://github.com/coreos/tectonic-installer/files/1201510/repro.zip where we might use something like a jenkins flow to manage the lifecycle of the aws cluster this pattern relies on a container image to host all that's necessary to deploy tectonic in aws. the initial deployment works. when doing a destroy and then a recreate of the same we see that on the controllers there appears to be some sort of race. in which the apiserver is available and but we see failures like: what you expected to happen? how to reproduce it as minimally and precisely as possible ? anything else we need to know?
