BODY : it looks like we've found a bug in genomicsdb. we had a project with 26 replicates same sample in there twice among another ~1000 samples. therefore we uniquified the names in the sample map that’s input to tiledb for those 26 samples i.e. converted them to project.sample instead of just sample -- but obviously the names in the gvcfs remained unaltered. when we look at the output vcf from genomicsdb, there's definitely a problem. these 52 samples are the first ones in the list and here's what we see: the first 26 samples the first occurrence of the replicates are fine. then the next 24 samples the second occurrence of the replicates are all “.:0,0” i.e. empty for all columns in the vcf. then the next 2 samples also second occurrences of replicates are fine. given that our batch size was 50 when importing into genomicsdb, this looks suspiciously like an error with the batching. so within a batch it looks like it’s not respecting the renaming somehow? @kgururaj
