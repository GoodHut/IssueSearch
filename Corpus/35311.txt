 URL : "https://github.com/camisatx/pySecMaster/issues/18" TITLE : dockerize the system BODY : there should be an option to use docker to containerize this system. using docker-compose, 2 containers should be built: - python container running all scripts - postgres container running database engine - volume to store database data the python container could then be run with arguments provided to it specifying which activities to run daily data, minute data, etc. . benefits: - make the system platform agnostic - insulate the software from the host system - allow for horizontal scaling of scrapers and database finally, this would allow for the future possibility of adding a web interface to the system by adding a suite of web focused containers django, nginx, redis, celery, rabbitmq .
