 URL : "https://github.com/SBU-BMI/quip_distro/issues/143" TITLE : enh: remove dupe code BODY : these 2 are basically the same, with a few differences: - js/annotationtools/toolbar.js - js/annotationtools_sc/toolbar_sc.js and this 1 appears to also be a copy of toolbar.js - js/annotationtoolslymph/toolbar_lymph.js so any time someone has to make a global change eg. tooltips , we have to make the same change in each of the 3 files. need to refactor.
