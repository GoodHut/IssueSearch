 URL : "https://github.com/Scille/umongo/issues/127" TITLE : dereferencing using motor BODY : hi there, i'm using umongo with the motor driver. i have the following documents: python from umongo import fields class community document : name = fields.stringfield brands = fields.listfield fields.referencefield 'brand' class brand document : name = fields.stringfield so using marshmellow with fields = 'id', 'name', 'brands' , whenever i do a get /communities, i get the brand id as a nested document in my response, which is fine as a default behaviour, but i'd like to be able to have the brands dereferenced. how would i go about doing that, considering i can't use .fetch in the get_attribute method of the serializer since it's a generator because of motor. so instead of this: javascript { id : 5a0c31d9d0fba69956a4cab0 , name : some community , brands : 5a0d5f2dd0fba6b738bc2da8 } i want: javascript { id : 5a0c31d9d0fba69956a4cab0 , name : some community , brands : { 5a0d5f2dd0fba6b738bc2da8 , name : some brand } } thanks!
