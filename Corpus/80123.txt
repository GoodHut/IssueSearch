 URL : "https://github.com/tomncooper/CSC8101-Documentation/issues/7" TITLE : task 6 - neo4j user id's BODY : task 6 asks us to use the demonstration movie db in neo4j. however user nodes don't have a property 'id'. when querying for the id of a user, or creating a new user node, should we be using/setting the internal id of the node, as there is no 'id' property? e.g. using the id function . thanks
