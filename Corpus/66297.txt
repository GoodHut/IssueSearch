 URL : "https://github.com/gre/gl-transition-libs/issues/22" TITLE : minimize the glsl code? BODY : we should also export to npm glsl minified version of the code that we would use for prod , it needs to be tested the same way it is with the non minified and it also needs to be used by everything except the gl-transitions editor . i think it will just be another entry point with a .min suffix in the filename. gl-transitions.min.json, gl-transitions.min.js,... but also the lib index.js probably should be the min by default and there are non min versions?
