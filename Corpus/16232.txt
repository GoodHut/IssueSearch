 URL : "https://github.com/rejax/TTT-EasyScoreboard/issues/25" TITLE : icons not working BODY : i found a few threads on facepunch but due to their age, i figured i would post here instead. i'm on the dev team for popular vanilla ttt server. we were asked if we could add a second column to the scoreboard, but when we started that we remembered the easyscoreboard had those neat built-in icons! long story short, i was testing on our dev server but could only get them to show up temporarily given the steam id and without any sort of set name color. entry that did work: ezs.ranks steam_x:x:xxxxxxxxx = { namecolor = rainbow , icon = badge , admin = false } entry that doesn't work: ezs.ranks superadmin = { name = owner , color = rainbow , icon = badge admin = true } are icons broken? do they only work individually? do you want my full config file? any guidance would be greatly appreciated.
