 URL : "https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/1458" TITLE : 405 method not allowed BODY : i have enabled cors on my server, but every time i have attempted to run a post method from the swagger editor installed using git clone, nmp install, npm start , the preflight options request returns a 405 method not allowed error. i have tried changing the response headers multiple times, and found the only thing that worked was to use fiddler to change the preflight request from an options request to a post request. i have not been able to figure out a way to get the options preflight request to return an ok http status code. can anyone help? thanks
