 URL : "https://github.com/cchandler/certificate_authority/issues/50" TITLE : can't require in jruby BODY : i'm currently developing against the master branch, as it's the only that runs in ruby 2.3 and greater without warnings. i've encountered this problem when running the ssl tests against the latest jruby: https://github.com/jruby/jruby-openssl/issues/24 this has been recently fixed, but not yet released check the discrepancy between report date and fix date : https://github.com/jruby/jruby-openssl/pull/124 i'd like to argue for autoloading the handlers in this gem, instead of requiring them. it will have the following advantages: better on-boot memory utilization only require what you use don't break if openssl side-feature isn't implemented by the distribution. the last one is obviously the important : as long as the components are thread-safe, autoloading shouldn't be an issue. what do you think?
