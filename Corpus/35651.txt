 URL : "https://github.com/brentsimmons/JSONFeed/issues/91" TITLE : event calendar items BODY : one thing i see lacking in rss is the ability to have items that advise about future events. for instance, i want to syndicate the swimming meet event calendar for my sporting organisation, so that individual clubs could include the calendar of upcoming events on their site. with rss i could do so by putting the upcoming date in the title of the item. however i'd like to be more semantic about it. i'd suggest just adding a 'eventdate' optional field to item. this would then allow implementations to feature future events.
