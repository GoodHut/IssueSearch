 URL : "https://github.com/aardappel/treesheets/issues/80" TITLE : printing and transparency BODY : i'm having issues with printing both to paper and pdf. it seems the png alpha channel is not rendered correctly. for instance the tutorial document has the nested style for tables but when printed the corner lines have black boxes. the same happens with every other icon available in the program. i'm using windows 10 with the latest updates. additionally when saving html with styles it doesn't save the images, unfortunately making treesheets unusable for a production environment. can anyone else confirm this issue? thanks.
