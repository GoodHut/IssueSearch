 URL : "https://github.com/akiran/react-slick/issues/627" TITLE : changelog and versioning BODY : hello, thank you for this great port. i have two questions: versioning which versioning scheme does this project follow? semantic versioning? http://semver.org/ . i am asking because it's not quite clear to me if a version update from i.e. 0.14.5 to 0.14.6 is a big change or not. if i check the commit history i can't see a clear pattern which defines when a version is bumped. can you maybe clarify that? changelog also where can i find the changelog? unfortunately i cannot finde a changelog.md or anything similar. thanks so much.
