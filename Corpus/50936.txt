 URL : "https://github.com/mlibrary/cozy-sun-bear/issues/44" TITLE : add full-screen widget BODY : as a user, i want to enlarge the size of the epub viewer to the full size of my screen and still maintain some of the tools in the application. - when a user clicks the full-size icon the epub viewer fills the height and width of the users screen - a new toolbar menu is presented to the user - a method to close out of full-screen mode is presented to the user - clicking close full-screen mode returns the viewer to the browser and maintains the current state of where the user was in the epub - uses the fullscreen-enter icon via <span class= oi data-glyph= fullscreen-enter ></span> for the full screen widget - uses the fullscreen-exit icon via <span class= oi data-glyph= fullscreen-exit ></span> to return to the epub viewer to its initial size this ticket requires the following items first: - a mockup of the epub viewer/reader and its menu in full screen mode
