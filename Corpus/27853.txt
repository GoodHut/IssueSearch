 URL : "https://github.com/asteris-llc/converge/issues/628" TITLE : enforce shell flags BODY : motivation in my use case i'd like to setup shell flags across all tasks as to avoid specifying the flags in every task. given the following tasks hcl task download { check = ... apply = <<eof set -e ... eof hcl task extract { check = ... apply = <<eof set -e ... eof hcl task deploy { check = ... apply = <<eof set -e ... } proposal taking the same implementation from terraform: hcl config { interpreter = /bin/bash flags = -e } anything in config would apply globally to all tasks.
