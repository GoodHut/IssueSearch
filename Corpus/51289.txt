 URL : "https://github.com/IBM-Security/isam-ansible-roles/issues/43" TITLE : addition of new stanza BODY : sometime it is necessary to add some stanza to isam rp configuration files for junction related settings or cred attributes setup as it is described in the isam federation cookbook. so we have developed a specialized role for dealing with the addition of non-existing stanza to isam rp configuration files called add_reverseproxy_conf_stanza using stanza.py . but i wonder if instead we should not extend the implementation of the existing add_reverseproxy_conf role to have it detect automatically if entries/values pairs are to be added/updated for stanza that are not yet defined, and proceed with adding those automatically. similarly, the update_reverseproxy_conf could be updated similarly. extending the roles such as add_reverseproxy_conf as opposed to provide a new one would help limit the proliferation of small utilities roles and help playbook developer get the job done more easily. should update_reverseproxy_conf deserve the same treatment? what are your thoughts?
