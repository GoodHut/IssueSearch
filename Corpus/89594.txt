 URL : "https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/dotfiles/issues/5" TITLE : rbenv folder overwritten? BODY : hi @mikemcquaid, it seems like the condition below: if -l $homefile && ! -d $dotfile then ln -sfv $dirfile $homefile else rm -rv $homefile ln -sv $dirfile $homefile fi will attempt to rm -rv the ~/.rbenv folder if the script is run a second time. not sure if you were going for idempotency in this script, but apart from this, i've been able to run the setup script multiple times to update dependencies and symlinks. feel free to close if you don't care about idempotency for this project.
