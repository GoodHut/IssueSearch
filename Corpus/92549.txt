 URL : "https://github.com/AccelerateHS/accelerate/issues/372" TITLE : your library is excellent BODY : utterly fantastic. just rewrote a simple monte carlo computation and got a greater than thousandfold speedup over my own crappy versions in matlab and python. annoyances with type inference aside, everything was well-designed and did what was needed. admittedly, part of the problem with my old code was that i'm just not a skilled parallel programmer. the types you've designed are an extremely useful tool for thinking though -- so even if not all of that thousandfold speedup is due to the technical merits of accelerate, i think it should still get the credit. this might not be strictly appropriate for a github issue, but i wanted to let you guys know!
