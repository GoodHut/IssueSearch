 URL : "https://github.com/computerminds/cm_config_tools/issues/27" TITLE : remove reverting command? BODY : config_update now has its own drush command for reverting config. it's not quite as 'nice', because there's one for a single revert, another for multiple reverts, and neither will work for config that is yet to import they have a separate command for that . i think because of that, we'll keep ours, as it's useful in update hooks to just blindly apply config changes regardless of whether it existed before or not. so i'll immediately close this issue, but it at least exists to document my thought process ;-
