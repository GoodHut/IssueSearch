 URL : "https://github.com/ebizmarts/magento2-magemonkey/issues/52" TITLE : concatenation of fields BODY : hi, situation - how did you get there? i am integrating this plugin for my company. in our mailchimp integration we have some fields that are concatenated lastname firstname because of that we can't use this plugin because it can't handle this situation . problem - what went wrong? nothing really... possible solution - how should it be? it would be really awesome if you could type something like this: lastname + firstname in the backoffice field mapping of magento to mailchimp. this should then result in concatenation of the first and lastname in mailchimp.
