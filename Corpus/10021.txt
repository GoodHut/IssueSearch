 URL : "https://github.com/taksan/native-tray-adapter/issues/4" TITLE : adding a license BODY : could you please add a license file to this repo? without one you technically still hold all rights wich makes it really hard to use in any kind of commercial environment... and if you intentionally want to hold all rights you could just state that in the license too :wink: altough i wonder why you made this project open source then...
