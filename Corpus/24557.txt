 URL : "https://github.com/tmenier/Flurl/issues/201" TITLE : support operator / BODY : it would be a cool feature if url would support overloading the / operator: public static url operator / url url, object path { return url.appendpathsegment path ; } this would allow to write following code: url baseurl = http://someurl var otherurl = baseurl / segment1 / segment2 .... @gitfool what do you think?
