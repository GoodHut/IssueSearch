 URL : "https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl/issues/567" TITLE : windows genkey error BODY : hello, i wanted to open up an issue following this discussion about people in a windows env https://discourse.julialang.org/t/documenter-jl-travis-genkeys-which-which-error-on-windows/5881/6 . i have made some progress but i stil have not gotten everything working correctly. i am not sure how much of this is able to be corrected in the codebase vs just adding to documentation outlining the process for windows more specifically. i found this windows specific issue already open https://github.com/juliadocs/documenter.jl/issues/444 but i was not sure exactly how what i am running into fits with this. see the above linked discourse post for steps taken so far: so far i have 1. travis.genkeys is not working workaround: generate keys manually from gitshell using ssh-keygen and manually copy and paste strings to travis and github. secondary problem: travis requires escaping characters so i had to manually add backslashes to the string? not sure if this is necessary? i also see .documenter.pub mentioned in various threads, do i need to create a file named that and move the physical .pub file anywhere? i am now stuck on travis hanging on a passphrase on linux as mentioned in this issue https://github.com/juliadocs/documenter.jl/issues/429 and completing the build successfully on mac but not deploying the documentation. i have added the documenter debug keyword as well. here https://travis-ci.org/crghilardi/forestbiometrics.jl is the link to my most recent attempt. in conclusion: what can i do to get around the passphrase error and get the documents building? is there any way to improve the windows genkey/deploy experience? if not, i can put a more detailed write up together outlining what i had to do once i actually figure out how to get it working. thank you for your help
