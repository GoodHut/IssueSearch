 URL : "https://github.com/MukurtuCMS/mukurtucms/issues/104" TITLE : links from source field BODY : it would be great if the source field was able to recognize a url link, so that source could be entered as http://mysource.com/sourcename and then user could just click and see the source. this kind of this works in the cultural narrative field, for example, but not currently in source.
