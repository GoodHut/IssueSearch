 URL : "https://github.com/dbpedia/ontology-tracker/issues/24" TITLE : check output of maven BODY : hi @gcpdev and @joernhees , the output looks still weird: https://travis-ci.org/dbpedia/ontology-tracker the most irritating thing is the filenotfoundexception java.io.filenotfoundexception: /dbo.tests.shapes.ttl no such file or directory java.io.filenotfoundexception: manual/nulldummy/dummy.tests.manual.ttl no such file or directory also there are unneccessary java exception traces java.lang.assertionerror: each owl:class should not have two or more superclasses: i understand that these tests should fail, but printing the stacktrace is not necessary. could you fix that? @gcpdev could you remove all code you are experimenting on from master and move it in a dev branch like the dummy.test.manual.ttl @joernhees invited you as a dbpedia maintainer. congratulations. thanks, sebastian
