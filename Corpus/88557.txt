 URL : "https://github.com/pbakondy/cordova-plugin-speechrecognition/issues/48" TITLE : not recognizing the words BODY : i try to show the recognized words with this code: // handle results function startrecognition { window.plugins.speechrecognition.startlistening function result { // show results in the console console.log result ; }, function err { console.error err ; }, { language: de-de , showpopup: true } ; } but the only result i get is: ongoing speech recognition why is it not showing the words i speak after that? has it perhaps to do with the matches? is there an example? how is the right code to show the spoken results into the console.log?
