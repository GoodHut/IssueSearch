 URL : "https://github.com/google/gousb/issues/8" TITLE : hot plug support BODY : any interest in the participants from kylelemons/gousb 9 @zagrodzki , @nkovacs, et al reviving the work on the hotplug event support in this version? my own golang/c skills are woefully inadequate to help in anything much besides testing and moral support, but i would be very interested in this feature for a project i'm flailing around with.
