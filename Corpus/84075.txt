 URL : "https://github.com/BBN-Q/Quince/issues/4" TITLE : corrupt data in qsettings BODY : while dealing with 3, i have frequently run into a problem where the position data in qsettings gets corrupted. consequently, i've been doing this a lot: python from qtpy.qtcore import qsettings settings = qsettings bbn , quince settings.clear settings.sync it would be better to track down where this error is actually thrown and handle it more gracefully.
