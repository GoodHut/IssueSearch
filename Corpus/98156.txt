 URL : "https://github.com/scenarioo/pizza-delivery/issues/20" TITLE : improve scenarioo reporter BODY : some findings from junit5 refactoring to be addressed in both versions junit4 and junit5 of the example: 1. exception information stacktrace should be attached to scenarioo report on test failure. 2. webdriver is initialized to listen for all interactions for each use case - shouldnt the listener only start to report during test execution such that a test could do some test preparation without reporting it? ? currenty it looks a bit weird this initialization is only done once per test class. in junit5 there is a special hook for beforetestexecution that could be used for that. 3. scenariooeventlistener: better rename to scenarioostepreporter or even webdriverstepreporter? 4. usecasecontext: i think we should rename this to scenriooreportercontext or something similar, since it holds more than just the use case ideas for junit5 only: maybe it would be better to not handle that as a singleton through the context holder but directly hold it inside the reporter ?? also we should later change it to use more of the junit 5 context info - see class extensioncontext e.g. displayname! 5. further ideas for junit 5 only: support tag annotation from junit5
