 URL : "https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/5025" TITLE : fix the hide/show helpers BODY : see docs: http://materializecss.com/helpers.html the helpers classes seem counter-intuitive and incomplete. some points i noticed: - .show is missing - med vs medium inconsistency. i suggest simply using s m and l in accordance with the grid system naming, resulting in show-on-m hide-on-l-only etc its ok to borrow some ideas from http://getbootstrap.com/css/ helper-classes . the table they display on that help page instantly tells me what class to use. on materialize's help page it takes me some time to determine which one i exactly need. in addition, some classes doesnt seem to work or im using it incorrectly? , please check this fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/gcqddbkn/ the show-on-small in this example is also visible on large and medium
