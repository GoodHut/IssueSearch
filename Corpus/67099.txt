 URL : "https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper/issues/1259" TITLE : optionally show results BODY : when i run customize-face , there are no swiper options, until i press tab . on other hand, when i run swiper , i see a lot of results with no input or tab keystroke. how can i switch this behavior: show results for customize-face immediately, and for swiper after some input and tab ?
