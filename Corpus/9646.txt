 URL : "https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow/issues/334" TITLE : about the recall BODY : i have trained my own dataset for 25000 steps, but found the recall is not satisified, only 60% somehow. and the lowest loss moving average loss is about 1.5,. can not decrease anymore. i wonder does anyone compared this tensorflow version with the original darnet version? can darkflow get an counterpart recall or accuracy with the original darknet version yolo2??
