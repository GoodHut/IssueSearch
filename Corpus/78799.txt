 URL : "https://github.com/archiverjs/node-archiver/issues/287" TITLE : release an update to npm BODY : in working with archiver i noticed the documentation references changes to .directory that are not released in latest npm module v2.0.3 the latest release still uses function onwalkpath filepath, stats when do you plan to release another version? i want to use the newer glob options described in the docs to create a zip archive that excludes the node_modules directory.
