 URL : "https://github.com/MikeKSmith/rspeaksnonmem/issues/17" TITLE : a couple addon thoughts BODY : 1. may want to consider replacing the system call with https://github.com/jeroen/sys this could also provide a nice way to background longer runs while keeping short runs linked. further, if you wanted to use this in a shiny app without completely blocking the interface, you could poll the pid from the app while the running to monitor status. 2. use options+config-file for setting up info about nonmem/psn/perl, let it check on package startup for information, then users can override with additional options or other settings. eg look in $home/rspeaksnonmem.yaml/toml/json, psn_location = ... nm_version = ... etc.. 3. provide a queue abstraction it they have more runs than threads and don't want to submit as a single job https://github.com/gaborcsardi/liteq though that would probably be a bit of work and may be beyond the scope and desired effort.
