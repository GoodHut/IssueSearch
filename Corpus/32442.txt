 URL : "https://github.com/dowjones/react-dropdown-tree-select/issues/31" TITLE : use as subcomponent BODY : when using the component as a subcomponent componentwillreceiveprops of dropdowntreeselect will be called for every setstate in the parent component which rebuilds everything using data prop even if data has not changed and even if it is a const variable . this means i have to update data otherwise all selections are cleared on every componentwillreceiveprops . since i don't want to manage the selections myself i changed componentwillreceiveprops to check if the data prop has changed and ignore it otherwise. this is however very ugly and more of a hack since the prop and the actual tree diverge this way -> i use data prop as the initial tree see fork https://github.com/h0rm/react-dropdown-tree-select/commit/15fe836eeb1084d5d3b0b8e0ab82bf7106991fe4 . my only idea to solve this would be to return the updated tree on onchange . this way the parent component can still decide to change the selections and the data prop and the actual selections are always in sync. however, this still means that on every componentwillreceiveprops everything is recreated not sure what this means for the performance . any thoughts on this? did i miss something really obvious?
