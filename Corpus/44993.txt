 URL : "https://github.com/pixlsus/raw/issues/27" TITLE : github caches shields BODY : if we open the source code for https://github.com/darktable-org/rawspeed/blob/develop/readme.md we can see: html <img src= https://camo.githubusercontent.com/<blurb1>/<blurb2> alt= raw.pixls.us - the free raw sample archive data-canonical-src= https://raw.pixls.us/button-cameras.php style= max-width:100%; > so it caches them. perhaps some header can be outputted to decrease the cache time?
