 URL : "https://github.com/yuku-t/textcomplete/issues/129" TITLE : minor ie11 incompatibility BODY : hello, when i use the textcomplete widget, it works fine in ie11, but upon closing the widget, throws this js error: object doesn't support property or method 'find' i traced the error to the getactiveitem function. array.find is not supported by older versions of ie. i believe a shim is necessary. the js error does not appear to have any detrimental effect on the user.
