 URL : "https://github.com/PowerShell/PSPrivateGallery/issues/32" TITLE : unable to delete modules BODY : logging an issue following discussion with angel calvo. my customer is trying the ps private gallery and is unable to delete modules after they are published. i understand a cmdlet is missing it's referenced as a to do in the code , we have tried removing all references from the database but the modules still persist. in the absence of a cmdlet can we have some guidance for in-publishing modules through the database directly? thanks
