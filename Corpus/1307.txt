 URL : "https://github.com/ntop/n2n/issues/3" TITLE : port 0 bug. BODY : i have been using n2n for some time. occasionally i got this issue, i could not find information about it. in supernode, a registering node is like this: registered new node public_ip= 2 11.22.33.44:12345 private_ip=0.0.0.0:12345 mac=11:22:33:44:55:66 community=my_community of course ip and mac are fakes, just examples. but some times the node registers itself as: registered new node public_ip= 2 11.22.33.44:0 private_ip=0.0.0.0:12345 mac=11:22:33:44:55:66 community=my_community notice the ip port is 0 zero . when this happens the log gets filled with warnings like this: warning: sendto sent=-1 attempted_to_send=84 invalid argument sorry i did not have time to trace this bug to the source code, hope it helps.
