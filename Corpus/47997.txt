 URL : "https://github.com/lepo-project/lepo/issues/86" TITLE : redesign sticky panel BODY : - as the panel overlaps with the content, part of the content is hidden. - even if there are no stickies or the panel is shown in mini mode, the panel overlaps with the content - since it is a panel of original design, it is difficult to unify it with ui of notes and bookmarks to be introduced in the future.
