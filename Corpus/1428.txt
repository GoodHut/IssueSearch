BODY : on build https://jenkins.ceph.com/job/ceph-docker-prs-ceph_ansible-kraken-xenial_cluster/179/console, we fail because of the following packages have unmet dependencies: nfs-ganesha-fsal : depends: glusterfs-common >= 3.8.8 but it is not going to be installed: unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages the packages are coming from a ppa. is it safe to build our containers against a ppa which is pretty unsupported ? can't we find a more reliable stream of package ?
