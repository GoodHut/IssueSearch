 URL : "https://github.com/mlaursen/react-md/issues/639" TITLE : slack channel is down BODY : https://react-md.herokuapp.com/ i am seeking clarification about how scss is applied to react components and ultimately the dom elements . i think webpack builds it into a global scss file. so selector specificity is still an important consideration. i could add css modules which as far as i can tell is just a way of creating high specificity of global rules through dynamic class names. alternately, i could use shadow dom to avoid global styles, but it isn't supported fully by browser's yet. there is a polyfill, but it appears to be challenging to add that to webpack. is that all correct?
