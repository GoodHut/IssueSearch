 URL : "https://github.com/nextras/orm/issues/213" TITLE : order by null first/last BODY : currently, orm doesn't unify null first/last behavior. in postgre there is different behavior than in mysql. what should be property fix? i would suggest: - let icollection::asc be internally asc_null_last and icollection::desc be internally desc_null_last - introduce new constants icollection::asc_null_first and icollection::desc_null_first. note: http://stackoverflow.com/a/8174026/859688 @jantvrdik what do you think?
