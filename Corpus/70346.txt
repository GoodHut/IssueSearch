 URL : "https://github.com/maelstrom2001/ArcticFox/issues/239" TITLE : vaporshark switchbox rx BODY : please make a patch for the vaporshark switchbox rx, it is the same board as the vaporflask lite which works very well with articfox. i can even get the native vaporflask lite firmware to work on it with the editor; however, i cannot get any of the articfox versions to work. they all appear to upload but then do not work at all...no screen display, nothing...so i have to put back on the vaporflask lite firmware since vaporshark doesn't have any firmware available yet. thanks much for all your hard work!!!
