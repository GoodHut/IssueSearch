 URL : "https://github.com/OpenAF/nAttrMon/issues/8" TITLE : mute plugs BODY : there are some plugs, notably output plugs, that are trigger by external events like http queries . so there isn't a need to update the internal plug info at a constant rate but rather they should query the internal channels for the requested info. therefore some plugs could initialize but don't need to be executed every x time.
