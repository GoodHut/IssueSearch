 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/issues/1677" TITLE : msbuild nuget package BODY : please provide an msbuild nuget package. it would help immensely with versatility and reliability of build scripts. not having a nuget package causes problems in things like cake scripts which obtain tooling from nuget without affecting the rest of the machine. it becomes difficult to cleanly locate msbuild 1377 . people e.g. cake resort to searching the default sku paths, which requires you to install vs2017. installing vs2017 is bloat for many people. i know that https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/ build-tools-for-visual-studio-2017-rc exists but the problem is that it affects the whole build server, not just a single isolated build. currently in order to take advantage of the new cps .csproj format or c 7 language features, i have do a machine-affecting installation. even if this build tools package worked with cake build scripts, it's not something we'd be very able or willing to experiment with on our build server the way we could if it was a no-install package that could be extracted. i can't think of a single downside to the nuget approach. /cc @onovotny @devlead
