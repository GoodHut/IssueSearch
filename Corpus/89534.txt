 URL : "https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/212" TITLE : question: importing files BODY : i am using the imports construct to import some files. i am calling the compiler from a number of different working directories, and noticed that the path is considered to be relative to this working directory. is it possible to add the directory of the .ksy script that loads the import as a directory to search as well, to allow calling this script from different working directories?
