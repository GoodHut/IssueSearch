 URL : "https://github.com/mrphlip/lrrbot/issues/270" TITLE : show info in the calendar BODY : i don't know if this is something you want to integrate into lrrbot, but as part of the new upcoming streams/events setup, we are planning on having adding the game and description for show to the google calendar. the current plan is to put the info into the description field in google calendar in the format: <game name> <description> with the game name set to - for shows that either don't have a game like checkpoint or watch + play or for which the game hasn't been chosen yet. i'm making an xsplit plugin that will pull the info from the calendar and format it into a page that streamers can use to promote the next streams. theoretically that info will be in e calendar and publicly accessible if you want to use it for the lrrbot !next command
