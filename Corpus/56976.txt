 URL : "https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/issues/1422" TITLE : parse bits to booleans BODY : querying bit type returns 0 instead of false or 0 . i don't see any reasons to have string results instead of booleans. i have read these but i don't think these problems are present here: https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/issues/339 https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/issues/378 can this be fixed?
