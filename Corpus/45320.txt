 URL : "https://github.com/rogeliog/jest-runner-mocha/issues/7" TITLE : how to resolve paths? BODY : i haven't found a way to resolve paths with the mocha runner. using this config: js { jest : { runner : jest-runner-mocha , modulenamemapper : { ^src/ . : <rootdir>/src/$1 }, testmatch : <rootdir>/tests/ / .test.js }, jest-runner-mocha : { clioptions : { compiler : node_modules/babel-register } } } ...and a module at <rootdir>/src/add.js , this test fails with cannot find module src/add.js : js import { expect } from 'chai'; import add from 'src/add'; it 'should add numbers', => { expect add 3, 3 .to.equal 6 ; } ; it does succeed when i remove the runner config option from jest , so i'm guessing that the mocha runner doesn't have a way to use jest's module resolution settings. i also tried doing node_path=./src yarn jest , but that didn't work, either. is there a recommended way to configure module paths? this would help a great deal with incremental migration.
