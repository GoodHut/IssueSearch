 URL : "https://github.com/RedHatSatellite/satellite-clone/issues/272" TITLE : don't disable rex BODY : disabling rex can cause errors as seen in the bz below. there is really no clean way to remove a plugin in satellite. we actually can keep rex enabled and not worry about talking to existing clients as ssh keys are regenerated on install so are invalidated for existing clients. https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1514383
