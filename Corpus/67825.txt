 URL : "https://github.com/ecederstrand/exchangelib/issues/256" TITLE : query room availability BODY : hello i was wondering if there is any way to call the getuseravailability from within the library, or at least pass the request through the library. i have to be able to query a rooms availability but without impersonation access, i currently can't and granting an account impersonation access is not what i want to do for security reasons.
