 URL : "https://github.com/ShotgunNinja/Kerbalism/issues/97" TITLE : signal ground stations BODY : as an enhancement for the signals system, being able to specify geographic points on kerbin that can receive dsn comms would be nice. it could be that if the user chooses not to define any ground stations the whole of kerbin is used as it is currently. additionally rovers/aircraft in visual range of a ground station could transmit data there directly rather than through an orbiting satellite relay.
