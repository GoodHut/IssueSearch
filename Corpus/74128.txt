 URL : "https://github.com/spaam/svtplay-dl/issues/545" TITLE : downloads are crap files BODY : i've had a problem several times downloading from svtplay where the downloaded movies files are crappy versions of the original video. these contain a grey image and have no sound you can't see anything in it . sometimes it will just be small movies maybe 10 mb and sometimes they are the same size as the original would be. it has never been a permanent problem though. it seems like you can always download the correct version 24 hours after the original upload. does anyone know if svt puts up different versions at different times? it is still a problem though because i need to get the movies as soon as they have been broadcast. interested in knowing if anyone else has had the same problem!
