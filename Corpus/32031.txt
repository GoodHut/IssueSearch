 URL : "https://github.com/in-toto/layout-web-tool/issues/33" TITLE : tie down data model BODY : currently there is no centrally defined data model for the app. form posted data is dumped to and retrieved from a mongodb collection by hardcoded keys in the app's views. @santiagotorres suggested to keep a data model https://github.com/in-toto/layout-web-tool/pull/14 discussion_r137062454 , which i think is a good idea. however, i would wait until the data model has become more stable c.f. https://github.com/in-toto/layout-web-tool/issues/29, https://github.com/in-toto/layout-web-tool/issues/25 .
