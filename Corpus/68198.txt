 URL : "https://github.com/pjhades/izzet/issues/15" TITLE : render article and page BODY : what i want to do is unifying article and page since they can be represented by the same data, we call it post. that being said, through the user interface we mention articles and pages but internally they will be implemented with the same data structure, namely, struct post . the only differences between an article and a page are: articles are generated in the directory structure formed with their timestamp, like ./2017/01/23/xxx.html , whereas pages each has its own generated html file articles are listed in the archive page
