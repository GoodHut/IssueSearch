 URL : "https://github.com/mosbth/cimage/issues/163" TITLE : load config file BODY : hi, i had some problems using an external config file imgd_config.php for imgd.php and i traced it down to this piece of code: php if is_file $configfile { $config = require $configfile; // triggers error 500 // require $configfile; // this works } elseif !isset $config { $config = array ; } $config = 1 afterwards - probably as an return that the file was read successfully,
