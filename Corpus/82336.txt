 URL : "https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/249" TITLE : add standard file backend BODY : standard file https://standardfile.org/models is supposed to be a very simple encrypted file store for notes, with an emphasis on simplicity of format and features. standard notes https://standardnotes.org is their current benchmark notes application, however, it lacks some of the nice-to-have features of boostnote. the two are similar enough, however, that it should be possible to make boostnote use standard file as a file store without too much difficulty.
