 URL : "https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues/4282" TITLE : flow nontermination issue BODY : js import react from react ; type t = a | b | c | d | e | f | g ; function enumfn : t {} export default react.createclass { proptypes: { mode: react.proptypes.oneof enumfn a , enumfn b , enumfn c , enumfn d , enumfn e , enumfn f , enumfn g , , }, } ; if i call flow coverage on this code it never terminates. it does terminate if you delete some of the oneof options so perhaps superlinear complexity is to blame. either way it causes flow to become nonresponsive and to hit 100% cpu for a long time. no https://flow.org/try/ link because it crashes the tab.
