 URL : "https://github.com/pyrosmiley/photoframe/issues/2" TITLE : schedule screen on/off BODY : allow for control of screen on/off from config file. since turning the whole thing on/off automatically isn't really an option without adding some hardware, it might make sense to just hijack the 'pwr' button on the screen driver with the rpi gpio. that'll at least let you toggle the screen on/off, since there's no need for it to be running overnight, and the power draw from the pi itself is _minimal_ at most. as far as i can tell right now, running a cron job would _technically_ work, but doesn't allow for any user-changed settings as far as on/off times. the less an end-user has to change mess with files, the better otherwise it won't be __mom-proof__, right? .
