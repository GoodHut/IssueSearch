 URL : "https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/issues/3993" TITLE : can't receive every toots BODY : hi, i recently had problems with my mastodon instance and i had to start over. i lost all the data. i'm not sure what happened and there's no way to recover it. good thing we were only two users on it with only one active me . i ended up with a brand new instance on v1.4.6 the old one was on v1.3.2 . so i recreate my account with the same name and the same domain and start refollowing people. thing is i don't receive toots or notifications from them. at first i thought i had a problem with syncing but, since yesterday, i received toots from the new people i'm following who were not followed before the incident . my guess is there is something about the remote instances not knowing i'm back or something like that been gone for about 10 days . plus, other instances previsouly connected to mine don't seem to get my toots unless i mention someone. and i don't receive the answers... if i delete a toot, the remote instances don't delete it... there is nothing in the logs, sidekiq is doing good. i tried something and created a new account on an instance i never heard about before. turns out it's the only instance in my authorized followers list and every kinds of operation follow, mention, toot, delete, ... in one way or the other is doing totally fine... do you guys have a workaround ? does this deserve a bug report ? is there a way to manually authorize instances/followers ? i bet the best solution would be to change the domain and start over again but i'm not sure it's a good solution on the long run.
