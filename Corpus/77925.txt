 URL : "https://github.com/sisl/ExprRules.jl/issues/6" TITLE : organization of packages BODY : i'd like to start adding other optimization algorithms to the exproptimization package. there are two fundamental capabilities that need to be implemented. 1. a probabilistic model that sits on top of the grammar, as in pcfgs. i.e., ce method uses this 1. sequentialization of the decisions of the tree to make it appear as an mdp. i.e., ge and mcts use this these functions are reusable pieces that may be common to multiple algorithms. where should we put them? some options: 1. into their own packages. 1. into exprrules 1. as submodules in exproptimization thoughts/preferences?
