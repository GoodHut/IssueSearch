 URL : "https://github.com/chriswingler/Intentionally-Buggy-Code/issues/1" TITLE : write buggy code BODY : add some code that _kind of_ works. it should make sense, given the scope of the project, but purposefully leave bugs in your commits for others to fix. pay it forward. keep these relatively simple to fix at first, since we're just starting out.
