 URL : "https://github.com/arkayenro/arkinventory/issues/959" TITLE : ignored pet journal open BODY : recently upgraded to the latest version and i see this arkinventory message. it seems to happen the first time i open the mounts/pet journal/toy box/etc. window using shift-p. i can't seem to make it show up afterwards. is this some sort of debugging message that's been added for new functionality?
