 URL : "https://github.com/turingschool-projects/1610-remember-9/issues/5" TITLE : create a new note BODY : at the bottom of the reminders.hbs template, there should be a button that routes the user to /reminders/new where users can create a new reminder. the new reminder should have inputs for the title, date, and notes. the new reminder should have a button for submitting the new note. pressing the button should submit a new reminder to the database and immediately displays in the reminders list. hot tip : there are no tests set up for this user story. so, youâ€™ll have to write an acceptance test.
