 URL : "https://github.com/AkashaProject/ipfs-connector/issues/8" TITLE : conditional dependencies ? BODY : the last version of ipfs-connector has js-ipfs as a dependency, even if i would like to use only go-ipfs. a nice thing would be to be able to choose the ipfs implementation. on a side note, this is currently a problem for me because of a error in one of the dependencies that ultimately pull react ! and break my app. i filed an issue there: https://github.com/ipld/js-ipld-eth-storage-trie/issues/3 └─┬ @akashaproject/ipfs-connector@1.8.2 └─┬ ipfs@0.23.1 └─┬ ipld-resolver@0.11.0 └─┬ ipld-eth-storage-trie@1.0.1 └─┬ aegir@9.4.0 └─┬ clean-documentation-theme@0.4.2 └── react@15.5.4
