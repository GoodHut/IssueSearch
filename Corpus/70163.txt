BODY : hi not sure what your intended audience is but the project references highcharts and that module is dual licensed restricted source the free gratis code is under cc-by-nc while you can buy a usage license if needed in a commercial project. maybe consider changing that module to something else to make it easier to use the project in a commercial setting. just a thought. see also: https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/4405 issuecomment-125124004 https://shop.highsoft.com/faq non-commercial-0
