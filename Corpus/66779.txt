 URL : "https://github.com/faye/websocket-driver-ruby/issues/52" TITLE : no client side examples BODY : i've been trying to get this up and running on the client side and thus far i've got this: ruby class ws attr_reader :url def initialize url @url = url @env = nil end def write data puts data end end driver = websocket::driver.client ws.new uri driver.add_extension permessagedeflate driver.set_header cookie , cookies driver.set_header origin , https://chat. {server}.com driver.on :open, -> e { puts were open: {e} } driver.on :message, -> e { puts gotta message: {e} } driver.on :close, -> e { puts goodbye! {e} } driver.on :error, -> e { puts gotta error: {e} } puts started? puts driver.start which will print something for the on :start event, but then will immediately print true and exit. would you mind putting together a really simple client side example for us to see?
