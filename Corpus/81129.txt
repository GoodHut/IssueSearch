 URL : "https://github.com/chrmarti/testissues/issues/7607" TITLE : virtual names on folders BODY : a lot of projects i work on have a subfolder named e.g _sw_, _trunk_ or _dsp_ which makes it inconveniant to have multiple folders open at once. proj1 doc sw <-- proj2 doc dsp <-- rel proj3 doc pw trunk <-- it's not very efficient to open projects at top level as this reveals too many hierarchical levels. would love some way of virtually renaming the opened folders.
