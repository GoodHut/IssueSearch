 URL : "https://github.com/coinbase/gdax-tt/issues/118" TITLE : bank wire status BODY : how do you verify the status of a bank wire in gdax? is there an api to see the status, or to match a wire and create a bot for events or change of status? if coinbase can't provide adequate support or any at all , can a bot be used to bypass waiting for hours to get connected to a representative and wait in limbo for funds that are neither here nor there?
