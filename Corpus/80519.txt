 URL : "https://github.com/UCATLAS/xAODAnaHelpers/issues/891" TITLE : typo w/ jet constituents BODY : a tiny bug was just pointed out to me in the jet constituents code -- https://github.com/ucatlas/xaodanahelpers/blob/f14adc3284ec611e873f5db0aa8e416e45c872cc/root/jetcontainer.cxx l1335 pt is filled instead of phi here. i'll fix it this afternoon when i get a chance and make sure this is the only place it occurs ... just making a note of it here to keep track.
