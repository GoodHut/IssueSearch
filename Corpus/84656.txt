 URL : "https://github.com/biojs/organisation/issues/8" TITLE : devops biojs.net is down! BODY : as rowland pointed out in the mailing list, the biojs.net page and the biojs.io registry are down. both were deployed to heroku, where i can't access the account. i'm assuming it's been deactivated, possibly for missing the payments. i will take a look into solutions as soon as i can. that will mostly involve: investigate reason for heroku deactivation investigate possibly alternative solutions for hosting reactivate heroku or deploy alternative. any help is appreciated. @biojs/core
