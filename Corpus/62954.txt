 URL : "https://github.com/katzwebservices/Contact-Form-7-Newsletter/issues/86" TITLE : custom field name issue BODY : hello, i've been using your plugin and found that it works really well except when it comes to labelled custom fields. when a form field cf7 is mapped to a custom field ccf on a form and the form is submitted, that field's data cf7 is sent through to constant contact as custom field 1 . now when managing contacts, it's often advised to rename the custom fields within constant contact. e.g. _if i rename custom field 1 to project name on constant contact, all contacts' custom field data is updated with the new label name._ this is great and makes list management much easier - it also helps with salesforce integration. the problem arises when a new form submission is made after the renaming. the new submission now creates another custom field in constant contact called custom field 1 - _the field we previously renamed_. now my list data is going to be fragmented and old list members will have conflicting field labels with new list members, not to mention, it seems like i'm using more custom fields than i actually intended to. i'm happy to assist with the coding but i'd like feedback on this first, is this expected behaviour ? should we allow users to name fields in the form settings? is this a constant contact api limitation?
