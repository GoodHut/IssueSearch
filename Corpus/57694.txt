 URL : "https://github.com/cassidoo/todometer/issues/54" TITLE : reduce large repo size BODY : i just cloned the repo and found out that it has a size around 150mb! that's a huge size for a github repo. so i figured out that something is wrong. by running some commands found out that the main large size is created by git holding a link to some files in the history that are removed from the current repo. most of those files had extensions such as .dmg , .exe or .nupkg . removing the link to them in the history would do no harm and will result in small repo size. i safely cleaned them on my local fork and the size is reduced from 150mb to about 130kb. i'd be happy to send a pr and discuss the changes in details.
