 URL : "https://github.com/mustafaturan/authable/issues/37" TITLE : dos possibility in oauth2 BODY : in lib/authable/oauth2.ex string.to_atom is called twice on user submitted input the grant_type parameter . this can easily be used for a denial-of-service attack by a malicious user. they would just need to send different grant_types until the atom table is exhausted. see https://blog.pryin.io/how-to-dos-your-elixir-app-with-twitter-and-atoms/ for an example of how this could work. one possible fix would be to use string.to_existing_atom instead, which would raise an argumenterror if the grant_type is unknown.
