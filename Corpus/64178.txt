 URL : "https://github.com/setempler/miscset/issues/18" TITLE : fix sort for data.table BODY : this works: sort data.frame a=3:1 but this doesn't: sort data.table a=3:1 error in .data.table x, , by, drop = f : j the 2nd argument inside ... is a single symbol but column name 'by' is not found. perhaps you intended dt ,..by or dt ,by,with=false . this difference to data.frame is deliberate and explained in faq 1.1.
