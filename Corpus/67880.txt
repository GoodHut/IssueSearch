 URL : "https://github.com/jderose9/dash-to-panel/issues/50" TITLE : quick access to options BODY : instead of going to tweak tool, finding dash to panel extension and then open preferences, can be a preferences menu option when we right click the 9-dot button? or if someone has disabled it, when we right click somewhere in the empty panel space? i think though that the best way is just by right click on 9-dots, rather anywhere on the panel. so if someone has disabled that, perhaps not getting that option is okay
