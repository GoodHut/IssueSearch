 URL : "https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/2749" TITLE : support desktop shortcuts BODY : it would be great to have support for saving the link of a web page into a shortcut. i would like to store most of my bookmarks in shortcuts that i can put in any folder and open them with a file manager. at this point i could do this by storing mhtml files which i find to be great feature , but shortcuts would be a more desirable alternative here. such functionality is common among other browsers. as to the implementation, one could add a command like: download --shortcut ... or download --desktop . similar to the behavior of the actual download command, a file save dialog should be prompted. the shortcut should have such a content: desktop entry version=1.0 type=link url=<url> icon=text-html
