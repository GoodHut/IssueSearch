 URL : "https://github.com/pornganizer/PGV4/issues/118" TITLE : scene released date BODY : this was mentioned in discord though i would put it here. for the scene released date when i add in a date it doesn't save to the database. currently i can add the date to the database myself with db browser and it will show in pg fine. it may be something to with me being in the uk and the format is being weird if i do mm/dd/yyyy the date field in pg just goes blank. if i do dd/mm/yyyy it show up in pg but in mm/dd/yyyy format the same goes if i do it in yyyy/mm/dd either way i do it it doesn't save to the database. p.s the dob for the stars works fine, and saves to the database. for that i use dd/mm/yyyy format.
