 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt-adafruit/issues/448" TITLE : home -> editor experience BODY : now that we have a shiney home screen, we need to polish a bit the transition to the editor: - home -> tutorial. works a bit slow - home -> example. the example snippet should not be rendered in the side docs. - home -> project. this does not work well for adafruit as the project requires making stuff. i propose to be able to open those in our docs instead of in the editor. - home -> learn.adafruit.com: works.
