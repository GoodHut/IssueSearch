 URL : "https://github.com/cryogen/throneteki/issues/1444" TITLE : asking for advice BODY : hello, first of all, i want to congratulate you for your magnific work with throneteki/theironthrone. when i first saw jinteki.net, i wanted to adapt it to got, but i could understand neither clojure nor the basic structure of a rules-enforced card game server... and because of that i'm writing this now. i'm willing to do a web to play star wars destiny. i tried to take a look at your code, but i'm totally lost and i don't know where to start looking and where to start coding. so i want to ask you for some guidelines about where to start and what are the foundations of nodejs backend for a web-base card game i have no doubts about the frontend . thank you so much in advance, and thanks again for the theironthrone :
