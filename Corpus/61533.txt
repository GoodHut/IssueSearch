 URL : "https://github.com/pantheon-systems/documentation/issues/2879" TITLE : backups tool doc update BODY : re: backups tool https://pantheon.io/docs/backups/ priority low : issue description: users that run backup and migrate use them so to integrate to external repositories like amazon s3. it lets them trigger backup and migrate and save directory to s3. but this makes their /tmp bloat and cause platform issues. customer would like to use the access backup script, but we didn't mention how they can run it. they don't have external servers just to run a bash script for backup. suggested resolution need to make comment here about not using backup and migrate, and if possible relate to /tmp folder issue. also, provide a recommendation on how they can run the script, and what to do if they don't have a tool. consider ci or quicksilver references? proactive 88755
