 URL : "https://github.com/FLAMEGPU/FLAMEGPU/issues/124" TITLE : make on windows BODY : using the new makefiles for 1.5rc, it should be relatively simple to support windows builds via make , using a bash terminal emulator such as msys2 with a windows install of make ie make from gnuwin32 . required changes / differences for windows: + alternate host compiler per os / do not provide one on windows and let nvcc choose. + use .obj for object files, rather than .o + do not pass -std=c++11 or similar when on windows. + do not link using -l$ lib_dir on windows. + explicitly specify the location of xsltproc as ../../tools/xsltprocessor.exe + different order of arguments for xsltproc usage on windows, $ xsltproc $ xml_model_file $< $@ + do not specify ld_run_path on windows, dlls are provided next to the executable files.
