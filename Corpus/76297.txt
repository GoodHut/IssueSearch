BODY : started checking the project right now, so please consider my lack of background... i noticed that we have two rexfiles in the repository: rexfile rexfile.old is the old one still needed? i couldn't find anything with git log about, but it seems the new rexfile has all the things from the old one and more. can we get rid of it?
