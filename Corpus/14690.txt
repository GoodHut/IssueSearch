 URL : "https://github.com/SynBioDex/SBOL-Validator/issues/79" TITLE : bug report layout BODY : it would be nice to have a new line for every new bug report so it could be easier to see each componentdefintion error report. for example, insert a new line between two different componentdefinition and moduledefinition when comparing between the two files. i had a hard time seeing between the two sbol objects when all bug reports are displayed.
