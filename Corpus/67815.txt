 URL : "https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/hasplayer.js/issues/144" TITLE : q: dash.js hdcp support BODY : i reached out to the dash.js community but i discovered some commits you guys made when doing my research so i wanted to understand how you guys are handling hdcp with dash.js? i also discovered that when the shaka player determines a stream's key status is output-restricted it will skip that one and basically play the highest sd stream. are you guys handling it the same way or just throwing a message? i noticed that your protectionmodel_21jan2015.js isn't the same as http://vm2.dashif.org/dash.js/docs/jsdocs/protectionmodel_21jan2015.js.html which led me to believe you have some experience with this scenario. reference links: https://github.com/orange-opensource/hasplayer.js/blob/3a8c63215d7ab9014d41f8d05357da421ba49574/app/js/streaming/protection/protectionmodel_21jan2015.js l198 https://github.com/orange-opensource/hasplayer.js/commit/387ec61c46893a2161970349e594ea357cefbf49 thanks
