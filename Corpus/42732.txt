 URL : "https://github.com/cgrand/xforms/issues/11" TITLE : by-keys and assoc-in? BODY : hi @cgrand, sorry this is more of a question than an issue. i was wondering if it was possible to achieve something very close to what xforms/by-key already does but instead using a kfn that returns a vector and use those keys to assoc-in the accumulator? i.e. something like this clojure xforms/into {} xforms/by-keys juxt :a :b {:a 1 :b 1} {:a 1 :b 2} {:a 2 :b 1} {:a 2 :b 2} ;; => ;; {1 {1 {:a 1 :b 1} ;; 2 {:a 1 :b 2}} ;; 2 {1 {:a 2 :b 1} ;; 2 {:a2 :b 2}}} ;; i.e {<val of :a> {<val of :b> x}
