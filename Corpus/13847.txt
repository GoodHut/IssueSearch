 URL : "https://github.com/juliangarnier/anime/issues/246" TITLE : 2.2.0 reduce size BODY : i think you can reduce the size quite a bit by transpiling to es5 via https://buble.surge.sh/ and then running the result through closure: java -jar compiler.jar --language_in=ecmascript5_strict --language_out=ecmascript5 --js anime.es5.js --js_output_file anime.min.js it gets rid of a bunch of the $jscomp stuff from the output. did not test the functionality though. this repo has no tests?
