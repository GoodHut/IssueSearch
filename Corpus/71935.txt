 URL : "https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-server/issues/3500" TITLE : api & placeholder images BODY : in our new api-centric approach, how do we handle placeholder images based on category/topic/sub-topic ? 1. does the api response for an event itself returns a placeholder image url in the place of the background image if the background image doesn't exist ? 2. or, does the api response for an event return null for a non-existent image and we have a separate endpoint that provides all the placeholder images for each category and the frontend can use both to display the correct placeholder. @mariobehling @aviaryan @saptaks @shubham-padia @magdalenesuo your views ?
