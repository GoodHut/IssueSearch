 URL : "https://github.com/WhiteMagic/JoystickGremlin/issues/71" TITLE : merge axis rework BODY : first off thank you for the hard work, this software you have created is really great! the biggest issue i've come across is problems with merge axis. the first issue i've had has been with response curves and dead zones with merged axis. in this case unlike elsewhere response curves assigned to the physical devices axis do not get applied. also the vjoy response curves do not get applied but that is covered in a different issue 67 here on github. the second issue is merge axis' settings seem to reset to different devices and axi when loading gremlin. the last issue i've had with this and is the topic for this rework is that merge axis is a separate popup interface instead of an action applied to the physical devices axis. so here is a bad paint mockup of what i'm proposing: <img width= 860 alt= partialremap src= https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5723368/31590970-2ca3c444-b1d7-11e7-9fc9-8f2b4e185f33.png > basically get rid of the merge axis popup and add it as an action. this brings merge axis back into the established interface for input to action mapping. this also allows for response curves set for the physical device input to be respected.
