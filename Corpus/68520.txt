 URL : "https://github.com/ForNeVeR/Jabber-Net/issues/86" TITLE : sasl external mechanism BODY : hello. after openfire released a new version with fixed of-1173 https://issues.igniterealtime.org/browse/of-1173 , server started to offer external mechanism by default. which is not working in jabber-net. i've tried to move digest_md5 before external in /jabbernet/jabber/connection/sasl/saslprocessor.cs createprocessor but it is not working either: sent: <auth mechanism= digest-md5 xmlns= urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-sasl /> recv: < recv: challenge xmlns= urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-sasl >%hash%</challenge> error: jabbernet.jabber.connection.sasl.saslexception: missing qop directive is there any fast fix to change preffed sasl mechanism to digest-md5 in jabberclient? or maybe external mechanism fix?
