 URL : "https://github.com/robymus/wowza-letsencrypt-converter/issues/3" TITLE : enginemanager on https BODY : i got the frontend working within wowza with your converter script. thx for that. i was wondering though how you got the backend running on ssl? http://ip_address:8088/enginemanager/ >> http is ok. access ok https://ip_address/enginemanager/ >> https is ok. but shows only wowza license, no enginemanager login page. based on the wowza documentation i also have to change the manager: https://www.wowza.com/docs/how-to-connect-to-wowza-streaming-engine-manager-over-https just for example in the /usr/local/wowzastreamingengine/manager/bin/startmgr.sh you have to edit the line so it will pickup the https port. but as soon as i change that to the settings i think has to be set, the enginemanager doesnt want to start. cmd= $_execjava -dcom.wowza.wms.configurl=\ \ -dcom.wowza.wms.confighome=$wmsmgr_home -djava.io.tmpdir=$wmsmgr_home/temp -dlog4j.configuration=file://$wmsmgr_home/conf/winstone.properties -djava.net.pre feripv4stack=true -jar $wmsmgr_home/lib/wms-winstone-1.0.5-boot.jar --prefix=/enginemanager --defaultwebapp=/enginemanager --tempdirectory=$wmsmgr_home/temp --webroot=$wmsmgr_home/temp --warfile=$wmsmgr_home/lib/wmsmanager.war --httpport=8088 --httpsport=8090 --httpskeystore= $wmsmgr_home/conf/my_ssl.jks --httpskeystorepassword= secret --ajp13port=-1 --directorylistings=false changing the values with the quotes or without doesnt matter. i have the my_ssl.jks file copied to the /usr/local/wowzastreamingengine/manager/conf directory so it should be able to use it. my vhost.xml has https port on 443
