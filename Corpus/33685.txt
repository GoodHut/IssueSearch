 URL : "https://github.com/solus-project/brisk-menu/issues/24" TITLE : alternative to brisk BODY : @ikeydoherty @flexiondotorg would you consider this https://github.com/ukui/ukui-menu instead of brisk? i like the mate de a lot. the only reason i've never adopted it was the lack of a good startmenu. i think brisk is okay but the one developed by the kylin guys is better. seems there's a compatibility issue but nothing huge, probably. thanks for reading through.
