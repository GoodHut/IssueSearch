 URL : "https://github.com/tsherif/picogl.js/issues/23" TITLE : picogl with npm BODY : @tsherif picogl is awesome! i'm interested in using this from node/browserify. rather than including picogl from a script, i'd like to be able to do: javascript var picogl = require 'picogl' var app = picogl.createapp canvas i'm wondering if you'd be open to modularizing the code so that this usable from both npm and as a global script include. happy to send a pr for this if you'd be interested! great work on this library!
