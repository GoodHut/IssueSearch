 URL : "https://github.com/zerobias/telegram-mtproto/issues/127" TITLE : the connection hangs BODY : hi! i'm using jsonstrugage from the examples in which i store the authorization data. when i try to use a saved copy in a new connection, everything works fine. but if several hours have passed, the call of the api methods hangs. any api methods. and that do not require authorization. for example, help.getconfig. the application simply hangs on await client help.getconfig maybe there should be throw some error in this case? but nothing like this happens. i'm using telegram-mtproto ver 3.2.11
