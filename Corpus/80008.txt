 URL : "https://github.com/tunnelvisionlabs/goworks/issues/11" TITLE : support running 'go get' BODY : as long as the workspace is configured as described in how to write go code https://golang.org/doc/code.html organization , goworks will load dependencies already obtained from go get . it will also refresh if a user manually runs go get from a separate command line. however, there is no way for a user to invoke go get from within goworks itself.
