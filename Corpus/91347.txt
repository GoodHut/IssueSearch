 URL : "https://github.com/nunit/docs/issues/162" TITLE : theory without parameters BODY : i have code base working with nunit 2 that uses theory instead test in most cases as commonly boolean/enum variables added as a parameters to support multiple test cases. after moving to nunit 3 i realized only after certain amount of time that theory tests without parameters are just ignored and not executed as it was in nunit 2. they are just ignored and not shown as ignored in test window of vs. i vote for therories without parameters to be considere as usual tests. or test should provide same auto value filling for boolean/enums as theory does. this is very convenient to mark tests with single attribute and don't fear that some test would just dissapear from invocation list after removing parameter.
