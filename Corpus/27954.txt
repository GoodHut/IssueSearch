 URL : "https://github.com/MoOx/reduce-css-calc/issues/33" TITLE : error when building BODY : when trying to use this library within create-react-app and performing a yarn build , i'm getting the following error: ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177476/30378822-7a936e2c-9862-11e7-8fef-7829340f3a6a.png it looks to be caused by template literals here: ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177476/30378840-88edaad2-9862-11e7-8d4b-4205cdad66b5.png which are not being transpiled out. i was going to use the es6 src instead of dist but it's omitted from the npm package. i see the build target is for node 4+ https://github.com/moox/reduce-css-calc/blob/master/.babelrc and not browser. any chance of supporting a browser target or exposing the es6 for browser libraries. btw, version 1.3.0 works fine and is what i'm currently using my react-svg-text https://github.com/techniq/react-svg-text component
