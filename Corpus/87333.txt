 URL : "https://github.com/greenrobot/EventBus/issues/441" TITLE : kotlin integracion needed BODY : hi, i'm starting to migrate from java to kotlin, where i found a npe generator, here: kotlin @subscribe fun asynchronousresponse responseobject_asynchronousresponse: responseobject { helper.processasynchronousrequest responseobject_asynchronousresponse } problem fixed by doing this: kotlin @subscribe fun asynchronousresponse responseobject_asynchronousresponse: responseobject { val responseobject_asynchronousresponse2: responseobject = gsonsingleton.getinstance .objectfromjson gsonsingleton.getinstance .objecttojson responseobject_asynchronousresponse , responseobject::class.java as responseobject helper.processasynchronousrequest responseobject_asynchronousresponse2 } just wanted to document that, and also to check whether we can start migrating to kotlin. thank you for your time
