 URL : "https://github.com/liavt/MACE/issues/12" TITLE : does not work on mac BODY : the glfwpollevents function must be called from the main thread. windows should also only be created on the main thread . since the windowmodule class uses a thread callback to do the per frame rendering, this function is called from a secondary thread. on windows and linux this is not an issue, but on osx calling this function for another thread leads to an invalid pointer. for a full list of the threading limitations with glfw functions, go to the glfw website: http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/group__window.html ga5c336fddf2cbb5b92f65f10fb6043344
