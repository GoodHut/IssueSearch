 URL : "https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/issues/13307" TITLE : .org plan: renewal date BODY : from pnpgk-2uc-p2 : this is the first i’ve seen of this error, but my assumption is this is actually effecting all accounts possibly. this user was asking the old age old question of why the plan was renewing at 11 months. going through their entire account, in their ak dashboard, in bd, and in sa, it shows the renewal being 1/25/18, however in their /me/purchases it shows the date being 12/25/2017. maybe we are trying to give them an xmas present, but i have a feeling this is an error. i’ve included the react debug below: ! image https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1554855/25280797/8067275e-26ab-11e7-80b6-57abd1b2a96b.png and some clarification by @janm6k : i guess this is because we apply the wpcom renewal date logic plan renewals 1 months before expire date to jetpack plans, which renew on expire date.
