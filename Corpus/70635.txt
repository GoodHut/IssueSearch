 URL : "https://github.com/Runnerly/tokendealer/issues/1" TITLE : working directory issue BODY : hi! i'm following along with docker 101 in your excellent book, but the first build command doesn't seem to work as expected. the commands i run are: git clone git@github.com:runnerly/tokendealer.git cd tokendealer/docker docker build -t runnerly/python . the build will fail with the following message: step 6/17 : copy docker/circus.ini /app/circus.ini copy failed: stat /var/lib/docker/tmp/docker-builder884936692/docker/circus.ini: no such file or directory i can get those steps to work by removing 'docker' from the copy commands, but will then get other file errors later in the script. i'm on a mac if that makes any difference.
