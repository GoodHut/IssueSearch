BODY : for this you will have to dual boot into ubuntu xenial, that or vm it but im none too sure how vms will treat you. docker is an option to pseudo get ros but it will eventually have to happen so i advise you dual boot at this point. you're going to be going through the ros tutorials found here: http://wiki.ros.org/ros/tutorials you're going to need to go through until, intermediate: defining custom messages just like with opencv, you're going to make your own repository for rosplayground. the build process for ros is a bit different, you'll learn that in the tutorials, here you'll learn catkin, which is how items are built, it's essentially the cmake we know and love just tailored and boilerplated for ros.
