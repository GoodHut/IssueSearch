 URL : "https://github.com/cyklokoalicia/OpenSourceBikeShare/issues/124" TITLE : collecting weather data BODY : this is a side project i'm working on which might be helpful for users of the bike share system. it requires a bluetooth temperature and/or humidity beacon, which cost around 10 euro. these can be places below the bike saddle. then the gps of the user's phone is used to determine the location. the data can be used to recommend cool routes in summer.
