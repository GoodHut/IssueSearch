 URL : "https://github.com/krakphp/cargo/issues/15" TITLE : lazy register container BODY : we need to build a container that basically will cache all of the register commands and figure out exactly what a service provider loads into a container. then this container should have the ability to load a service provider lazily depending on the value. things to consider - what happens when multiple service providers define the same value. make sure to keep the order that the original service providers were. - this cache file needs to be able to be generated via a cli tool. - it needs to be able to work the same way in a dev or production mode app.
