 URL : "https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core/issues/130" TITLE : kafka improve testing BODY : two big issues with the current kafka test: - we should be getting more beans from the broker possibly from the clients as well , several of them can be seen via jconsole. unsure if the problem is related to the metric type $meter vs $gauge, etc . tests are passing because they've been disabled for now. get back to it. - add more flavors, at least 0.9.1, even if we have to backport fixes and roll our own container. had to ignore older kafka's for now because https://github.com/wurstmeister/kafka-docker container has some issues jmx_port exposition in the older versions, and some unknown problem bringing the cluster up in 0.8.2 .
