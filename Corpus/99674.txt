 URL : "https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/issues/482" TITLE : navigationoptions priority BODY : according to the docs, you can provide navigationoptions in three places: - static property on a screen - within a navigator 's routeconfigs - within a navigator 's staticnavigatorconfig with the priority being: > the navigationoptions from the screen will be merged key-by-key with the default options coming from the navigator. whenever both the navigator and screen define the same option e.g. header , the screen wins. and: javascript stacknavigator { // for each screen that you can navigate to, create a new entry like this: profile: { // optional: override the navigationoptions for the screen navigationoptions: { title: {state} => ${state.params.username}'s profile' , }, }, } ; i.e. routeconfigs > screen property > staticnagivatorconfig . this seems a bit unintuitive, since the paradigm is that things defined most closely to anything bind most tightly. my intuition is that a title defined as part of the screen's properties should have the highest priority, since the user is actively viewing the screen. i understand that the screen is technically embedded within the navigator, and therefore a title defined within the navigator itself would be the tightest binding and should therefore be the highest priority. but especially in the case of a stacknavigator , i tend to associate the title with the screen and not the navigator . in other words, my intuition is that navigationoptions defined as part of a screen should bind most tightly. do other people have this intuition as well?
