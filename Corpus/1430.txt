 URL : "https://github.com/veredrec/The-Magic-VASS/issues/63" TITLE : ux / ui fix BODY : i like how you display a 'fetching data' message to the user when requesting more data. however it's a bit annoying that it resizes the page every time. you might want to consider having the 'fetching data' message in a separate box, and / or keeping the size of the results div fixed so that the page doesn't change size on each update.
