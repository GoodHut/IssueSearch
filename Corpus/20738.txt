 URL : "https://github.com/angelozerr/tslint-language-service/issues/9" TITLE : create npm package BODY : using npm link is only a good solution during development. i would like to include this as a dev dependency in my package.json so everybody in the team uses the lint by default. it would be nice to add the project to a ci and configure it to do automatic deployments when a new tag is added.
