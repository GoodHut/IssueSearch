 URL : "https://github.com/intel-hpdd/rust-libzfs/issues/6" TITLE : create libzfs bindings BODY : create libzfs bindings so we can programmatically call into libzfs and fetch info about imported pools, datasets and vdevs. this issue has multiple parts: - create low level set of bindings around libzfs using bindgen. - create higher level rusty bindings around the generated libzfs-sys - update the existing nvpair rust crate to allow for fetching of nvpair / nvlist values. - wrap the libzfs lib again with neon so we can call into libzfs via node. - create bindings from libzfs-node to f via fable.
