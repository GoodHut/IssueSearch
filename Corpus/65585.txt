 URL : "https://github.com/bridgedotnet/Bridge/issues/3034" TITLE : issues with source maps BODY : i don't have a good repro of this yet everything seems ok in a small project , but source maps are behaving strangely in our main project. example, check out this code: ! sourcemaps https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1078012/29114484-6412cada-7cec-11e7-8ca8-5d2d05a51ae4.jpg line 78 and 79 are disabled for breakpoints, even though 76 and 77 are enabled. trying to add breakpoints by clicking on the line numbers has strange behaviour: - clicking line 67 puts a breakpoint on line 67 - clicking line 68 puts a breakpoint on line 69 - clicking line 70 puts a breakpoint on line 71 - clicking line 72 puts a breakpoint on line 82 - breaking on line 67 and then pressing step jumps to labeltext on line 82 additionally, i think that the source maps aren't working for related projects even when sourcemap is enabled both on the referencing and referenced project , since i only see the .cs files from the main app and not our components. i'll keep trying to get a small repro i can share, but if you have any tips for helping track it down in the meantime, let me know. if i can't get a repro i can share publicly, i might be able to share something privately for you to investigate.
