 URL : "https://github.com/Kwoth/NadekoBot/issues/1556" TITLE : issues with server mute BODY : .mute - will apply _server mute_ even when it said itself that it doesn't have the necessary permission to execute the command. the user has to be in a voice channel for this to happen. .voicemute - only works if the user is inside a voice channel i think this is intended .unmute and .voiceunmute - fails to remove _server mute_ if the user is outside of a voice channel. note that the user has to be server muted first. _tested this with the public bot_
