 URL : "https://github.com/jsxc/jsxc/issues/522" TITLE : hide disconnected users BODY : it seems that hiding disconnected users is not working. css class toggle is ok but the css is not matching the rosteritem. current roster item are: <li class= jsxc_rosteritem data-bid= ...... data-type= chat > <div class= jsxc_avatar jsxc_statusindicator jsxc_offline data-status= offline ... ... ... </li> so the jsxc_rosteritem is not hide with the css: jsxc_buddylist.jsxc_hideoffline .jsxc_rosteritem data-status='offline' { display: none; } as data-status= offline is never a part of jsxc_rosteritem but of its div child. data-status should be added to li parent items instead of div. cheers
