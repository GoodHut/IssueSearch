 URL : "https://github.com/senior7515/smf/issues/178" TITLE : rpc - xor map lookup test BODY : there are 2 main places in the hotpath that are lookup heavy. 1 method dispatch of the rpc framework. 2 in the wal path we do lookup of topic,partition tuples for every write. we need to make sure that those 2 paths are optimized. currently we use unordered_map. however other map datastructures are designed for lookups! - we do not do a lot of insertions - so it's ok if they are slow. however, the lookups have to be exceedingly fast. https://github.com/skarupke/flat_hash_map/blob/master/flat_hash_map.hpp i'm not convinced that if we stored the rpc methods in a std::vector + for loop it wouldn't be faster for example. this is blocked by the microbenchmark framework - i need to add the stuff for google-benchmark next.
