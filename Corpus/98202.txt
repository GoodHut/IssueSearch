 URL : "https://github.com/a8cteam51/onbeing/issues/5" TITLE : in-depth theme code review BODY : after we address the issues from the initial code audit 1 , we will do an in-depth review of the theme's code. some areas that will be addressed that i noted after doing a brief sweep of the theme files. - document headers are missing from theme files. - stylesheets and js need to be loaded inside functions.php, using the wordpress script enqueuing function. also, move inline js into separate files and load them using this same enqueuing function. - all functions, variables, and constants unique to this theme need prefixing to avoid namespacing conflicts. - make sure all variables and attributes are escaped before output to the screen.
