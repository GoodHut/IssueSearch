 URL : "https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/issues/393" TITLE : react example complexity BODY : this is a feature request for the react examples i guess. i'm learning react and i've just started to try and implement mdc-web. i'm using mdc-web v0.6.0 with react v15.4.1 ubuntu 16.04 vagrant box running on fedora 25 + firefox i've installed and run the react example 1 . it works perfectly straight out of the box, which is awesome. plus it gives a fully working state handling model using purecomponents and immutable as part of the example which is also great. what concerns me is that checkbox.js 2 is ~200 lines long excluding the licence comment . if it is 200 lines to implement a checkbox, how much coding does it take to implement a form with error handling? or beyond that an application. perhaps i'm just penalising the example because it gives a good level of detail of handling state, which most other examples don't do. so my questions would be: 1. is the level of complexity an issue with mcd-web or react or mcd-web + react 1. is the level of complexity going to grow exponentially as you add components 1 : https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/tree/master/framework-examples/react 2 : https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/blob/master/framework-examples/react/src/checkbox.js
