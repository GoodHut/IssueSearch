 URL : "https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1024" TITLE : parametermap ignores + BODY : hi. i came across a problem. i'm using akka-http to provide a simple rest-api that allows a user to sort the data s he wants. the following example shows how i want to provide it: /user?name=max&sort=+birthday . the important part is the parameter sort. the user should list all the parameters comma separated with a leading - or + . the concrete problem is that the + gets ignored. i'll show you the printed parametermap of the example call: > map name -> max, sort -> birthday it's hard to notice but instead of an leading + there is an whitespace. or better to see in this example: > users?name=max&sort=+birth+day > map name -> max, sort -> birth day did i something wrong or is it a bug? ps: i'm using the high-level api
