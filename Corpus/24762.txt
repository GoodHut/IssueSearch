 URL : "https://github.com/DDOCharPlanner/DDOCharPlannerV4/issues/42" TITLE : tier 5 lockout bug BODY : it's currently allowing me to take tier 5 in two trees simultaneously soul eater and tainted scholar . not sure if that's a result of having previously done a respec or not. however, when i put a point into a tier 5 ability in the 2nd tree, it does show the xs across the ones i've already taken in the 1st tree.
