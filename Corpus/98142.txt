 URL : "https://github.com/ZeroK-RTS/Chobby/issues/363" TITLE : improve lua download queue BODY : currently the head of the queue is told to be downloaded regardless of whether there is another download in progress. for vfs downloads this appends the download to the end of the vfs queue. this is problematic in the case where multiple high priority downloads are created, for example in a room with a few rapid map changes.
