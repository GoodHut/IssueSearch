 URL : "https://github.com/SleepyTrousers/EnderCore/issues/76" TITLE : a few ineffectual configs BODY : the following configs have no apparent effect. 1 fixbedsound=true described as changing the sound when walking on beds from stone to wool. instead it always sounds like wood. 2 fixpackedicetool=true described as allowing packed ice to be picked up with a pickaxe. i assume this means a pickaxe without silk touch. packed ice broke without dropping anything using a non-enchanted diamond pickaxe regardless of this config setting. special: slabtoblockrecipes=true no recipes added for red sandstone or purpur slabs. all other vanilla slabs appeared to work properly. minecraft 1.10.2 forge 12.18.3.2281 endercore 0.4.1.66-beta debug crash: https://gist.github.com/vt-14/d24ad83a4007c8c0aa644be5360e2c41 log: https://gist.github.com/vt-14/2311f14b9fb72771589a0f6713a03b9c
