 URL : "https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-bootloader/issues/203" TITLE : wiring up dns zone in gcp BODY : when bbl creates our dns zone it uses a different set of google's nameservers. this means every time we destroy the environment and re-run bbl up we then have to manually re-wire the nameservers we delegate to for that zone. this is kind of a limitation in gcp but i know for certain i can manage all of this using raw terraform. it would be nice if we had a solution that eliminates this manual step. @enocom
