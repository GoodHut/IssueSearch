 URL : "https://github.com/stefan-niedermann/nextcloud-notes/issues/162" TITLE : open password ! BODY : i realised that when i came back to setup page param√®tres in french i can click on the eye symbol and see my nextcloud password. no much people have access to my device, but i don't like they should have access so easily to my clear passwd. should the connexion be provide by nextcloud account when available. not sure android is very secure, but a bit less easy to access i hope.
