 URL : "https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/issues/2762" TITLE : docs: es6 installation BODY : the docs http://reactivex.io/rxjs/manual/installation.html say to install rxjs-es and import rxjs . this doesn't work as the import needs to match the npm module name. github suggests installing rxjs . which is correct? also, it might be worth clarifying this bit: > to import what you need and use it with proposed bind operator: does that apply if you import the full set of functionality or only if you import what you need? happy to pr this when i get time once i have clarification on the above.
