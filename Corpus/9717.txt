 URL : "https://github.com/tupleblog/tupleblog.github.io/issues/15" TITLE : add author pages BODY : in case reader want to look for the article written by specified author. i've tested looping through site.data.authors but it doesn't seem to work well. {% for item_hash in site.data.authors %} {% for item in item_hash %} <li>{{ item 0 }}</li> <li>{{ item 1 }}</li> {% endfor %} {% endfor %} this doesn't work either.
