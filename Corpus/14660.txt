 URL : "https://github.com/infinitered/ignite-ir-boilerplate-2016/issues/24" TITLE : branches vs repos BODY : how would you feel if used branches instead of repos to do our ignite-ir-boilerplate- forking? we'd get to keep history and have one place to manage. i believe having multiple repos might be a bit unwieldy. /cc @jamonholmgren @gantman @kevinvangelder @derekgreenberg @robinheinze
