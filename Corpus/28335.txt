 URL : "https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-javascript/issues/57" TITLE : forbidden 403 error BODY : hello, i am trying to access skills for a particular user which can be retrieved from https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/skills tested at https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer however, when i write a function in my react app for the same: getskills callback { this.client .api '/me/skills' .get err, res => { if !err { callback null, res ; } else this._handleerror err ; } ; } the response is always 403 forbidden . i have updated the application and delegated permissions and have logged in as a user. i am able to run simple get requests like https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me or get /users etc. is there something else that needs to be done to enable access to additional endpoints? thanks, abhi
