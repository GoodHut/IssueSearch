 URL : "https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/2079" TITLE : add support got glsl files BODY : related to 1517. right now the only option for using glsl shader files is to expose the shader as a string. many editors provide good extension support for writing shaders. using a javascript string means missing out on syntax coloring and other analysis by the editor. it would be much better to add default support for glsl files via the raw-loader.
