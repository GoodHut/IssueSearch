 URL : "https://github.com/daltoniam/Starscream/issues/366" TITLE : compile issue on xcode9b5 BODY : xcode 9 beta 5 swift 4 now complains if you put void as the function deceleration parameter list. in websocket.swift, you have: public var onconnect: void -> void ? and public var onpong: void -> void ? this triggers a warning, as well as errors below in the same file, where those two functions are called. the warnings and error go away if you remove the void like so: public var onconnect: -> void ? and public var onpong: -> void ?
