 URL : "https://github.com/capaj/require-globify/issues/31" TITLE : glob without resolving BODY : hi, i have a question about resolve . i just want globbed files. i thought, this will work: require './includes/ .js', {mode: 'expand'} ; but internally it will use default resolve functions path-reduce , strip-ext . if i dont want to use any resolving function i need to write my own resolve function, i.e: resolve: base,files =>files, or simply use empty array . require './includes/ .js', {mode: 'expand', resolve: } ; require './includes/ .js', {mode: 'expand', resolve: base,files =>files} ; my questions: 1 is empty array a hack? i think it should return defaults. 2 what is the correct approach to omit any resolving functions thanks in advance
