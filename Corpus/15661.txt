 URL : "https://github.com/jameswilddev/SprigganTS/issues/36" TITLE : fast numeric text BODY : there's quite a few places in games where you might need rapidly changing numeric text health, speed, etc. . currently this would cause a lot of resource waste as you would need to make and throw away a wrapping group every time it changed. it could be quite useful to have a numeric text class which creates and maintains a fixed set of sprites on its own, changing their frame and hiding/showing as appropriate.
