 URL : "https://github.com/wbsoft/frescobaldi/issues/914" TITLE : version of qt 5 BODY : is the requirement of qt >= 5.4 https://github.com/wbsoft/frescobaldi/blob/master/install l40 really a requirement or is frescobaldi simply not tested for qt5 < 5.4? the latest version of qt 5 that could be compiled on mac os 10.6 was 5.3.x. i'd like to have a working frescobaldi 3 also on mac os 10.6, but i don't want to ask the maintainer of macports' qt 5 to invest time in providing qt 5.3 if you already know that it wouldn't work.
