 URL : "https://github.com/bpmn-io/moddle-xml/issues/25" TITLE : use saxen for xml parsing BODY : we could consider replacing sax-js https://github.com/isaacs/sax-js with saxen https://github.com/nikku/saxen for xml parsing. compared to sax-js saxen is a faster, smaller sax-style parser that that handles certain issues, such as importing elementform=unqualified elements cf. https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-moddle/issues/38 in a more elegant way. in summary, switching to saxen would provide us with the following benefits: saving 20kb in bundle size speeding up import of huge xml files https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-moddle/blob/master/test/fixtures/bpmn/complex.bpmn by factor two simplifying namespace normalization carried out in reader ; saxen takes care of these things under the hood
