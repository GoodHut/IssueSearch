 URL : "https://github.com/serge-rider/dbeaver/issues/2078" TITLE : ctrl + o defect BODY : noticed two issues when pressing ctrl + o to open an sql file: 1. if there is nothing open in sql editor, pressing ctrl + o does not do anything. the open file dialog box does not pop up. 2. when pressing ctrl + o while a sql file is open, the contents of the chosen file in the dialog box will replace the contents of the sql file that was previously opened. i don't think this should be the case.
