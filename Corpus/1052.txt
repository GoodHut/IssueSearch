 URL : "https://github.com/FelschR/aspnetcore-identity-documentdb/issues/15" TITLE : flaky tests BODY : i noticed that the tests seem to have a timing issue. we saw this in one of our projects on ci but not our machines when testing with documentdb emulator. for us forcing the test runner onto a single thread allowed it to finish the tests in an exponentially quicker timeframe. cheers
