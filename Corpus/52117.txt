 URL : "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/2383" TITLE : cannot /unban an admin BODY : i might have come up with a way to paint myself in a corner. i accidentally banned a user from a private room, then in a misguided effort as per the known api-change related problems, no clients were able to unban him again to get him free again, granted him administrator privileges in that room. then, as i hadn't gotten anywhere, i started to look into the api and tried to unban the user via curl, using this call: curl -xpost -d '{ user_id : @user:matrix.org }' https://www.matrix.org/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/$channel:matrix.org/unban?access_token=$accesstoken this, unfortunately, returned an error code m_forbidden and the error message you cannot kick user @user:matrix.org. as this is supposedly the current api call to unban users, i am guessing that i cannot unban a fellow admin user although i am not entirely sure why the error message is talking about kicking the user , which, if correct, would raise the question as to how to unban an admin? or am i completely off-track here?
