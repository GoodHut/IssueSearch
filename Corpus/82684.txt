 URL : "https://github.com/tnozicka/openshift-acme/issues/12" TITLE : annotate route with error BODY : it'll be helpful to have the annotations added on the error status. eg when a cert is added we get. kubernetes.io/tls-acme.last-update-time: '2017-06-16t05:51:36z' if a renew fails or we can't authorise the domain, it would be nice to have a log of the error in the annotation so a user who doesn't have access to openshift-acme logs can at least see what could be wrong.
