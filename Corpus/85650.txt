 URL : "https://github.com/derv82/wifite2/issues/27" TITLE : fix & improve wep attacks BODY : i tried chopchop last night and it didn't work for me. the chopchop attack succeeded and generated a .xor which was forged into a replayable .cap file. but the script did not replay the .cap file. i'm worried other attacks are not working as-expected e.g. when no clients are connected . also, the output of chopchop was terrible -- only showing ivs . ideally the script would parse the output of aireplay-ng --chopchop , show the current % completed, and any errors/warnings output by the program.
