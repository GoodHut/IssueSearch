 URL : "https://github.com/ghuntley/ghuntley.github.io/issues/7" TITLE : 2.0.1 package doesn't work BODY : not sure if this is an issue with my project, but i recently pulled down 2.0.1 from nuget and there are no dlls in the package folder so it doesn't seem to work now. i can see the two files in the src folder and that's it. i have many other packages in this project. not sure why it's doing this.
