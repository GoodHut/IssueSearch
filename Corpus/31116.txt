 URL : "https://github.com/SCAII/SCAII/issues/14" TITLE : rpc modules in core BODY : we need to be able to create the ability to do rpc from core. this would minimally consist of: a new plugintype with rpcconfig , this would entail both a required ip and port . as well as an optional executable and argument list so people don't need to manually start things themselves . this should support module , agent , and backend . in the case of backend , the special functions like serialization will just be abstracted as a serializationrequest scaiipacket followed by a get_messages call. special care needs to be taken in case multiple messages get returned. may require some api change.
