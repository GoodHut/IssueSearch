BODY : i am wondering if this is going to be integrated into dgraph ? partly because i find dgraph awesome but also to see usage examples to get an idea of good approaches. i want to try out using go generate on top of this for some ideas. i want to try this out and help improve it, so i was wondering if it's worth making a basic roadmap ? for example the wal looks really interesting for doing data sync / reconciliation between many instances.
