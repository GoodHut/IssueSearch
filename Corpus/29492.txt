 URL : "https://github.com/ES-DOC/esdoc-docs/issues/238" TITLE : lumip solar forcing BODY : solar forcing means something different for land models than coupled models. coupled models require incoming solar at the top of the atmosphere. for land-only simulations, solar forcing at the surface comes from the meteorological forcing dataset gswp3 , which includes all the meteorological forcings required to run a land model, including temperature, precip, longwave downwelling radiation, specific humidity, wind, etc. you don't need to list them all as they come with the gswp3 meteorology forcing dataset.
