 URL : "https://github.com/snblitz/RaspberryPi-SmartWifi/issues/1" TITLE : http server crashes BODY : i have gotten this to work a few times, but the majority of the time the web server crashes and kills the perl process. this is the log: spawn webservice temporary failure in name resolution at /usr/share/perl5/http/server/simple.pm line 169. use of uninitialized value in subroutine entry at /usr/share/perl5/http/server/simple.pm line 422. bad arg length for socket::sockaddr_family, length is 0, should be at least 2 at /usr/share/perl5/http/server/simple.pm line 422. mywebserver: you can connect to your server at http://localhost:80/ the name resolution message doesn't _seem_ to be the issue; it doesn't crash anything and that message happens even when it works. the line 422 errors seem to happen on http requests and the process dies shortly after. any ideas?
