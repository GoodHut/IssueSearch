 URL : "https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/1983" TITLE : autoselect zones request BODY : one ha best practice when deploying at aws is to run clusters across azs. kops currently supports this by manually passing the azs you want to use through the --zones and --master-zones args. this requires that users manually determine which azs, which slows down installations and provides a potential for user error or confusion. we should definitely keep this mechanism in place, but i propose that we also add another mechanism where kops auto selects which zones to use. here's one idea for implementation: add these two args: --region and --zone-span . if --zone-span isn't present default it to 3. if --zones and --master-zones are both absent and --region is present, then automatically determine which zones to use. so --region us-east-1 --zone-span 3 would effectively yield something like the following under the covers: --zones=us-east-1b,us-east-1c,us-east-1d --master-zones=us-east-1b,us-east-1c,us-east-1d . not all aws users have access to all regions, so you'll need to query the aws. one such way is to use the cli as follows: aws ec2 describe-availability-zones and then parse the json such as with jq jq '.availabilityzones | . | .zonename' --raw-output .
