 URL : "https://github.com/rbuckton/reflect-metadata/issues/71" TITLE : types not reflecting BODY : using 2 different json serialization libraries i am having an issue regarding type order with angular 4: the 2 cases are documented here: https://github.com/shakilsiraj/json-object-mapper/issues/9 https://github.com/jf3096/json-typescript-mapper/issues/19 the main issue seems to be the types must be defined in a particular order in order to be recognized. is this ok behavior or is this a bug of the library. as i use the same object multiple places and sometimes have them nested the app i am working on needs it what would be the proper way of including them.
