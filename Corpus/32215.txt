 URL : "https://github.com/dotnet/wcf/issues/2132" TITLE : unable to load dlls BODY : despite several attempts, i can't seem to reference additional dll's or packages in this project. - i've focused mostly on the system.private.servicemodel csproj, but i've tried other csproj's and even the init-tools.msbuild script with no luck. - if i reference a dll by absolute path, relative path, forward slahes, backslashes, etc the compiler always complains that the dll could not be found. with other vanilla projects i can load these dll's without issue. - if i reference a package, the package reference seems to be completely skipped. the package is not downloaded into the packages/ folder and build errors related to the missing package remain unresolved. any ideas what i'm doing wrong?
