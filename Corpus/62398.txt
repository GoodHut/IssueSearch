 URL : "https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/526" TITLE : client timeout property BODY : hello, when i use this code: using var client = new imapclient { client.timeout = 5000; client.servercertificatevalidationcallback = s, c, h, e => true; client.connect mailbox.host, mailbox.serverportnumber, mailbox.usessl ; client.authenticationmechanisms.remove xoauth2 ; client.authenticate mailbox.user, mailbox.password ; var inbox = client.inbox; inbox.open folderaccess.readonly ; the client.connect still takes about two minutes to error out. i thought the timeout property of 5000 would change that to five seconds. any help that you can provide to make the timeout property work would be gratefully appreciated. thanks, tony
