 URL : "https://github.com/UnbounDev/node-strava-v3/issues/45" TITLE : include type information BODY : including type information with this library would make use of it by third party developers much easier. this would essentially mean converting this library to typescript and transpiling the ts files to js files which would be published to npm in the same way. the end user would not see any difference unless they wanted to use the types in which case life would be so much easier . would you accept a pull request for this change?
