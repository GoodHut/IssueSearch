 URL : "https://github.com/joey8williams/querybuddy/issues/1" TITLE : unneccessary input params BODY : isn't it possible to infer selectortype in most of these functions by using a w3c compliant regular expression against the selectorvalue ? or some derivative of how jquery determines how to query the dom based on string input? it seems like allowing a user to manually specify the selector type can lead to input divergence where a selector value cannot possibly match the provided selector type.
