 URL : "https://github.com/jpanther/Dectorio/issues/51" TITLE : better/old concrete style BODY : could you add alternative images for concrete to your mod? big tiles instead of small slates similar to the old ones but hopefully in hr . because the current concrete looks like it was placed by a lazy gardener quite a bit in the past. or like being ploughed up by a tank. the borders that were added in 0.16 look almost nice even when mixed with the old 0.15 concrete images, however there is too few contrast between both. i guess it would be sufficient to change the color of the main concrete image. i tried it myself using this code: lua data.raw.tile concrete .material_background.picture = __myconcrete__/graphics/terrain/concrete/concrete.png data.raw.tile concrete .hr_version.material_background.picture = __myconcrete__/graphics/terrain/concrete/hr-concrete.png data.raw.tile hazard-concrete-left .material_background.picture = __myconcrete__/graphics/terrain/hazard-concrete-left/concrete.png data.raw.tile hazard-concrete-left .hr_version.material_background.picture = __myconcrete__/graphics/hazard-concrete-left/concrete/hr-concrete.png data.raw.tile hazard-concrete-right .material_background.picture = __myconcrete__/graphics/terrain/hazard-concrete-right/concrete.png data.raw.tile hazard-concrete-right .hr_version.material_background.picture = __myconcrete__/graphics/terrain/hazard-concrete-right/hr-concrete.png and some slightly edited files from 0.15. ! concrete https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1579362/34122147-bc51df5a-e42b-11e7-9c95-712011edd7bd.png however they look blurry due to the zooming. my own attemps to create better looking/hr concrete went horribly wrong.
