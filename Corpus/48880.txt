 URL : "https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/2843" TITLE : sql: unify stat table BODY : to gather statistics optimizer uses sql_stat1 and sql_stat4 tables. in original sqlite code only stat1 table is active by default. sql_stat2/3/4 tables can be activated using compiler options. the proposal is to remove useless code for stat2 and stat3 tables. moreover, executing select query leads to inspection of stat1 and stat4 tables. stat4 contains a way more information about indexes and tables histogram data , so it could be profitable to unite stat1 and stat4 in one table in order to avoid excess select queries to stat1 table and decline time spending on analyze.
