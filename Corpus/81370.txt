BODY : first thank you for creating this package and making it easier and less verbose to implement state management. i wonder if it's possible to use redux-logger with repatch? i've tried to add redux-logger as middleware without success. javascript import store, { thunk } from 'repatch'; import { logger } from 'redux-logger'; export default new store { counter: 0, } .addmiddleware thunk .addmiddleware logger ; am i doing something wrong or is repatch not compatible with redux-logger?
