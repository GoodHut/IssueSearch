 URL : "https://github.com/syncloud/mail/issues/1" TITLE : mail not installing BODY : hello, i don't know if i should file an issue for such problem, not if i should do it here. my email app doesn't install from the app center. on my first attempt, the installing message kept turning for 10+minutes, so i went back to the main menu. now each time i go to the app center, if i click on install the installing icon only appears a few seconds, then back to install , but no email in app menu nor any error message. best regards, fb
