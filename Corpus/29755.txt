 URL : "https://github.com/dcourtois/premake-qt/issues/11" TITLE : moc parameter order BODY : i am using this extension as part of the total war build system, and i find that the order of the moc parameters is different from that suggested by the moc tool qt 5.7.0 . in a couple of situations this has proven to be non-trivial, resulting in non-building projects. i've made a simple fix to resolve this: is there something i have overlooked or would you be interested in a pull request?
