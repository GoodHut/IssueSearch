 URL : "https://github.com/intel-cloud/cosbench/issues/358" TITLE : build needs serious help BODY : the build.md is very unclear, and the whole process seems to rely on eclipse as the build system? that's pretty smelly. i tried to muddle through, but the instructions refer to functionality and options that don't seem to exist. i pivoted to using intellij and generated an ant build that seems to almost work? except it doesn't start up quite right. i think. either way, this should never have taken a day of my time.
