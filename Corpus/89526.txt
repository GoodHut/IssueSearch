 URL : "https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el/issues/78" TITLE : question straight is slow BODY : hi, i'm using straight on an android phone with termux . if my init load time was ~1 minute, now with straight is more then 10 ~900sec . i don't know if i'm doing something wrong, since it's building every package every time, even if i straight-freeze-version . in the init i'm calling the functions straight-declare-init-succeeded and straight-declare-init-finished, and since i was using use-package with almost all packages with :defer t , so i'm calling after the bootstrap straigh-use-package 'use-package with always-ensure = t my question is if the boot time is supposed to be that slower, or if it might be a problem with the find 1 call, or in general how to debug it. this package manager seems promising remember me a bit of nix https://nixos.org/nix/ and i hope to be able to use it at its full potential. thanks, nicol√≤
