 URL : "https://github.com/CVC4/CVC4/issues/1233" TITLE : minimal model cores BODY : it would be interesting to have the feature that prints only the core of a model, that is, a subset of the model values that can be extended arbitrarily, here is an example: declare-fun x int declare-fun y int declare-fun z int declare-fun f int int assert = f x 0 assert or > z 5 > y 5 check-sat by default we may get a model looking like this: model declare-fun x int 2 declare-fun y int 0 declare-fun z int 6 declare-fun f _x int int 0 this could be minimized to: model declare-fun z int 6 declare-fun f _x int int 0 notice that and = \ _x 0 x 0 or > 6 5 > y 5 rewrites to true for any x,y , which our rewriter would detect. hence the functionality of check-model + rewriter could be used to greedily minimize various for which the input still rewrites to true.
