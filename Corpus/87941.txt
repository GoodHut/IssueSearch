 URL : "https://github.com/FoldingAtHome/fah-issues/issues/1212" TITLE : microsoft disables opencl BODY : when ms updates video drivers, they overwrite existing drivers which forces opencl to be disabled. while this is a problem belonging to microsoft, fah does not provide a rational message telling the donor what to do about it. > fahcore 0x21 started > warning: fahcore returned an unknown error code which probably indicates that it crashed > warning:wu01:fs01:fahcore returned: unknown_enum -1073741515 = 0xc0000135 the error 0xc0000135 should be trapped and words to the effect of you need to install drivers that support opencl from your gpu's manufacturer or something like that. see https://foldingforum.org/viewtopic.php?f=96&t=30309 this is increasingly a problem since microsoft now forces updates that they consider critical and whenever they update the drivers, it crashes fah for any project that uses opencl. i have not tested this on linux and it should be. the open drivers supplied with most distros don't work for a similar reason although it probably gives a different unknown_enum code.
