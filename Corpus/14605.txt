 URL : "https://github.com/kchen29/GraphicsToMusicXML/issues/16" TITLE : beginnings of omr BODY : we should probably start at least a little on omr. commonly: 1. preprocess image 2. detect and remove staff lines to make easier the 3. detection and classification of music symbols. then we 4. integrate link the data. we can also 5. check for errors e.g. correct time sig - measure relation . preprocessing image: binarization no need for color rotation reduce noise gaussian filter staff line removal will we do this? : horizontal projection then filling in gaps music symbol detection and classification: we should try to detect for now: staff line measure barline time and key sig notes
