 URL : "https://github.com/edvin/tornadofx/issues/427" TITLE : onundock not called BODY : in the following case, onundock is not called: kotlin import tornadofx. class testview : view { override val root = label override fun ondock { println ondock called } override fun onundock { println onundock called } } assume the testview is the main window of the application. i want thus to detect when the window is closed. this for instance to save the size of the window as a preference.
