 URL : "https://github.com/xbmc/chorus2/issues/217" TITLE : support for music videos BODY : hi first up please excuse my lack of knowledge about kodi and chorus in general, i haven't been using either for long. i've noticed kodi i'm using 17 rc2 has awareness of music videos, as distinct from movies, tv shows and audio-only songs. this appears to extend to the api http://kodi.wiki/view/json-rpc_api/v6 videolibrary.getmusicvideos . in my use case i have about 6,000 music videos which i'm hoping to remotely control using chorus2 but its current functionality seems to be limited to the browser nav item. 1. search doesn't return any results, probably because the several xhr calls to the json rpc api look specific to movies, tv shows and audio artists, albums and songs. 1. if i build a playlist of music videos via the browser playlist dots > add to playlist , i can save the playlist, but its contents can't be subsequently retrieved via / playlists, probably because the call to /jsonrpc?playlistcollection returns each result item as a type musicvideo . is support for music videos on the roadmap, or is there a configuration option i'm missing? thanks!
