 URL : "https://github.com/TheAngryByrd/Marten.FSharp/issues/10" TITLE : figure out sql parameters BODY : as of now, you can't use named parameter queries https://jasperfx.github.io/marten/documentation/documents/querying/sql/ named-parameter-queries easily from f because the parameter handler looks for anonymous objects https://github.com/jasperfx/marten/blob/8d758aa614a05a43900eff3167f7a89e6c9052f8/src/marten/linq/queryhandlers/usersuppliedqueryhandler.cs l54 which f doesn't support. the code for detecting anonymous types https://github.com/jasperfx/marten/blob/master/src/marten/util/reflectionextensions.cs l84 just looks to see if the object has a namespace. you _can_ do this from f by declaring types in a module only file like fsharp module parameters type byname = { name : string } but this is not obvious nor optimal. i have an stackoverflow question about detecting f record types from c at runtime https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46608051/detecting-f-record-type-from-c-sharp-at-runtime to see if we can maybe add a detection to marten main. if that's not easy/possible we should consider alternatives.
