 URL : "https://github.com/RealismusModding/FS17_seasons/issues/585" TITLE : all crops turned to cut BODY : i was playing and completed seeding my crops in mid summer season length of 3 days . i then skipped the night to the next day and all of the crops on the map changed to a cut state. i think this is a bug as it happened to all field whether i owned them or not. i am using the latest developer version. also, i tried making some changes to the script to force a growth state on the next transition to reverse the issue and then undo my changes to restore the seasons mod to normal. i couldn't quite figure it out as i don't have script reference for the game. would this be possible and if so then how? i am a developer so i can do lua changes. thanks
