 URL : "https://github.com/brson/stdx/issues/35" TITLE : add stdx-check tool BODY : one of the main roles i have in mind for stdx is as tool to measure the compatibility of the larger ecosystem. the stdx-check tool determine whether any given crate was 'compatible' with stdx, serving two purposes: - by running stdx-check across every crate on crates.io using cargobomb probably , we could say what percent is compatible, which would inform the development of stdx, and also give users confidence that stdx is actually leading them down the right path. - users could run stdx-check on their own crates, to validate their stdx compatibility at the most basic level i imagine it doing the following: - rewriting ./cargo.toml to add the a stdx dependency from git for now perhaps , outputting to cargo-stdx.tol perhaps - running cargo test on the new manifest to see if it passes - inspecting the generated lockfile to see if any of the stdx crates have dupes. other nice follow on work: - support multiple stdx revisions, probably by include_str ing their tomls - verify a crate directly off of crates.io, which would require frobbing their cargo.tomls https://github.com/brson/cargobomb/blob/master/src/toml_frobber.rs . - write a tool that runs stdx-check across a list of crates.io crates and generates a report with the results, indicating stdx ecosystem compatibility.
