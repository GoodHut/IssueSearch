 URL : "https://github.com/kryptan/lithium/issues/1" TITLE : use system fonts BODY : to avoid bundling fonts with lithium apps we need to use fonts already available on the target system. for each supported platform we'll need to know: 1. where system fonts are located? 2. what fonts are guaranteed to be installed? 3. is there a way to determine some default font that should be used for ui? ideally, there should be functions get_default_font , get_default_bold_font , get_default_italic_font , get_default_bold_italic_font which will be implemented differently on each platform. on some platforms they may return bundled font instead. unresolved question: what if different scripts need different fonts?
