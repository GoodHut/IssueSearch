 URL : "https://github.com/phil-harmoniq/NET_Pkg/issues/7" TITLE : name appimagekit BODY : hi, thanks for this interesting project, looks very promising. please be aware that the name is appimagekit for the project and appimagetool for one of the tools contained therein. currently you write appimagetoolkit in the readme.md and on the github releases page; such a thing does not exist. keep up the good work; looking forward to a hello world example and eventually to an example that shows how to bundle monodevelop as an appimage.
