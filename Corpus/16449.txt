 URL : "https://github.com/zalando-zmon/zmon-aws-agent/issues/98" TITLE : integrate aws sqs BODY : our team is using aws sqs simple queue service a lot. for monitoring we were relying on manually created entities, but this is getting tedious and error prone. the zmon aws agent should automatically pick up all sqs queues and create entities for each of it. implementation strategy the idea would be to invoke list-queues https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/services/sqs.html sqs.client.list_queues and then for each entry in the array of queue urls, invoke get_queue_attributes https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/services/sqs.html sqs.client.get_queue_attributes to retrieve the settings. entity structure proposal yaml id: sqs-<name-of-the-queue> aws:111122223333 type: aws_sqs name: <name-of-the-queue> infrastructure_account: aws:111122223333 region: eu-central-1 url: https://sqs.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/111122223333/<name-of-the-queue> arn: arn:aws:sqs:eu-central-1:111122223333:<name-of-the-queue> message_retention_period_seconds: 1209600 maximum_message_size_bytes: 262144 receive_messages_wait_time_seconds: 10 delay_seconds: 0 visibility_timeout_seconds: 30
