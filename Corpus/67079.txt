 URL : "https://github.com/adrian-pace/FROG-analytics/issues/13" TITLE : optimiyation of context BODY : computing the context is long, it might cause issues for big scale practices, optimizations required: o n^2 with n being the number of operations can we improve this? note that it was n^3 + n^2 before but it's still slow.. adrian-pace commented 6 hours ago you might want to do a time analysis of the whole program to see which are the critical parts... paragraph might be slow too, if so i can have a look . parser can be rather easily optimized too if you find out it's delaying the program a lot in blue, it's done on 650 pads, in red it's only done on 150 pads. 40sec isn't that bad?
