 URL : "https://github.com/brandon3055/Draconic-Evolution/issues/568" TITLE : donator wings bug BODY : i noticed that my donator wings were not showing up so i looked into it and they're not being added until you enter single player - it is possibly fixed in later versions but i'm running 1.10.2-2.0.6.157.
