 URL : "https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-gem/issues/644" TITLE : ruby doc update needed? BODY : hello, why do you suggest using gem oj v2.12.14? that version doesn't work with ruby 2.4.x -- however oj v2.16.1 - does. i'm also curious why you don't suggest oj v3.3.x. i've been using that version with rollbar and haven't notice any problems. is there a reason you suggest using this older version of oj and why not the newest version or at least a version compatible with ruby 2.4.x such as oj v2.16.1 if this is just out of date docs -- can they be updated? thanks, bill
