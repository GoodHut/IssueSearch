 URL : "https://github.com/shawncplus/ranviermud/issues/103" TITLE : change item serialization BODY : items currently serialize their entire object. update serialize to only serialize the item's entity reference and a new state object. state will default to an empty object. any runtime modifications to items should be done in state . for example: i enchant item a to have +5 damage. state should be something like { bonusdamage : 5 } this makes it so that if the builder later updates that item's base damage the item saved to the player's inventory isn't broken. the following copied from slack: > i don't think items need a whole effects system. anything that an effect would accomplish could be done with a behavior/script or an effect on the player > take for example a poisoned weapon effect. it would be an effect that applies to the player with an infinity duration and it would just listen for player hit events to remove stacks until it was 0 then remove the effect > if a weapon was, for example, a fiery weapon that did extra fire damage it would just be a behavior called elemental-damage that looked for a elementaldamage config on the item's attributes
