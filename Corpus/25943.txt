 URL : "https://github.com/ABASystems/redux-jam/issues/6" TITLE : add loading trigger BODY : the discussion has been had about not loading a component's data on mount. this has uses in loading only when the component scrolls into view. one of the ways we can manage this is by providing an option to dbcomponent to only load when a certain trigger has been passed to the props. this allows the child components to still render a placeholder as they see fit without any data being loaded. we would need this to allow the page to have space filling components.
