 URL : "https://github.com/ngryman/cz-emoji/issues/10" TITLE : emoji icon resource/list BODY : i basically want to have the same types as provided by the default cz-conventional-log package. i figure others maybe doing the same so i'll update this with a link to the commit when i'm done. meanwhile, this is the emoji list i'm using: https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908 is there a better one? is there anything inaccurate about using this? ... i guess i'm not sure what beetle the value should correspond too. enjoy and thanks!
