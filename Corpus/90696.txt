 URL : "https://github.com/khmelevskii/babel-plugin-jsx-base-component/issues/1" TITLE : split the plugin into two BODY : in most of cases the plugin is used for exists feature but component switch is used really rare. please make 2 plugins: one for component switch base component itself and another for exists property. <base component={foo ? foo : bar} /> <div exists={foo}> /> existence plugin should allow to change a name of the property. for example i want to use two underscores as for meta property: <div __exists={foo}> /> or, the most interesting for me, hidden property. <div hidden={foo}> /> the last use case allows to turn on/turn off the plugin any time and works transparently for everybody.
