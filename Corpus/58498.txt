 URL : "https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack/issues/552" TITLE : slow start of tracking BODY : although i'm happy to see this new release, i discovered a significant slow down of the initial start of the tracking. when clicking on start the cpu load rises very high and after about 5 - 6 seconds i get working tracking and seeing three crosses. is this expected behavior in the new release? because of the weird flippings i get sometimes with hat tracking still get them in this release unfortunately, https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack/issues/289 i rely on the restarting of headtracking instead of just resetting the view with centering because then the weird flip stays . however with restarting the tracking taking up 6 seconds now this is not really an option anymore.
