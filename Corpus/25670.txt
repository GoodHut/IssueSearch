 URL : "https://github.com/phalcon/docs/issues/1436" TITLE : a little suggestion BODY : phalcon is a very good framework and i love it very much. i come from china and in my country people think that learning phalcon is very expensive. so i started to participate in the translation of the document. but i found that crowdin has translated 100% of the documents can not be fed back to the phalcon official website documentation, i feel this will not be able to better promote everyone's enthusiasm. hope that the translation of the finished document can be synchronized to the official document. thank you
