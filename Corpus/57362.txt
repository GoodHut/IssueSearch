BODY : i've been working on testing using woocommercenet and have ran in to an issue with trying to figure out how to add product tag s when creating products. i've tried using several different methods of adding tags, but nothing seems to work to actually get the tag s written to database. adding global/local attributes seems to work just fine with the code/method below, but i can't seem to crack the code on adding tags when creating products. thanks for any help/guidance. very impressed with how well the library works overall. example code below: //add new product product p = new product ; // product details p.type = simple ; //add tags p.tags = new list<woocommercenet.woocommerce.tag> ; tag tg = new tag ; tg.name = test brand ; tg.slug = test-brand ; p.tags.add tg ; // add attributes brand p.attributes = new list<woocommercenet.woocommerce.attribute> ; woocommercenet.woocommerce.attribute att = new woocommercenet.woocommerce.attribute ; att.id = 1; att.name = brand ; att.position = 0; att.variation = false; att.visible = true; att.options = new list<string> ; // brand name att.options.add test brand ; p.attributes.add att ; //take json result and deserialize into product before returning var s = await wc.postproduct p ; var pout = jsonconvert.deserializeobject<product> s ; //return product return pout;
