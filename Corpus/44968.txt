 URL : "https://github.com/slimphp/Slim-Flash/issues/29" TITLE : get the first message BODY : very often you would only need one message of a certain key ; or you know 100% there is only one. if that is the case its mega overhead to be doing array looping/checking in your display code. can we introduce something like this? class v6messages extends \slim\flash\messages { public function getfirstmessage $key { $messages = self::getmessage $key ; if is_array $messages && size $messages >0 { return $messages 0 ; } return null; } } after that you can just use {{$messages->getfirstmessage 'key' }} in your template code nice and clean.
