 URL : "https://github.com/EasyEngine/nginx-build/issues/7" TITLE : use dynamic modules BODY : hi, maybe you can create dynamic modules of the current extensions you are using in nginx so you don't keep a whole build of nginx maintained. dynamic module functionality was added in 1.9 and in 1.11 a flag was added you can create a .so module and use it on all nginx installs. see nginx 1.12 and 1.13 blogpost https://www.nginx.com/blog/nginx-1-12-1-13-released/ check the nginx 1.11 in review paragraph you can even get them included on nginx modules https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/modules/ .
