 URL : "https://github.com/giuspen/cherrytree/issues/249" TITLE : feature view node links BODY : i think it will be very usefull to be able to list nodes which link to selected node. more important even: when trying to delete a node, receive an alert if other nodes have link to current node, which will then be broken, and list them so we can cancel to sanitize concerned nodes if we want.
