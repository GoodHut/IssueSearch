 URL : "https://github.com/sunjun-group/Ziyuan/issues/34" TITLE : l2t incomplete cfg issue BODY : in this version, cfg is sometimes constructed in an incomplete way, which leads to inaccurate data classification. for example, the code like: 1. if x<1 { 2. do1 ; 3. } 4. else if x>10 { 5. do2 ; 6. } 7. else{ 8. do3 ; 9. } 10. print ; the existing cfg only capture decision node, thus, there will be a branch <4, 10, true> and a branch <4, 10, faluse>. moreoever, the existing implementation recognize whether a branch is reached by checking its vertices for one run. therefore, the following such bug happens. some test input like x=-100 may go through line 4 and line 10, so the existing implementation will think the branch <4, 10, false> is reached.
