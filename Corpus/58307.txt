 URL : "https://github.com/google/cameraview/issues/151" TITLE : set / get aspect ratio BODY : hey guys, not sure if it is an issue, but if i set aspect ratio explicitly in code to, e.g. 9:16 for supporting portrait mode and then call getaspectratio the output will be still 16:9. cameraview.setaspectratio aspectratio.parse 9:16 ; cameraview.getaspectratio ; // output: 16:9 so again not sure if it is functionality issue, or just the getter is wrongly returning.
