 URL : "https://github.com/adventure-collective/lanterns/issues/2" TITLE : led length issues BODY : a few times i've seen an issue on the mcus where we've sent a string that's too long for it to be interpreted, which has caused it to crash kinda hard to debug without plugging in . led number could be provided in the broadcast message, included in the network.json and used by the server to limit messages. also the mcu could protect the call and catch any issues. failing silently might make it harder to debug though maybe if there's an error all lights flash red?
