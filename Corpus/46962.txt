BODY : today i have bought a new tv for use with my pi and fullpageos. i put my pi into my new tv and power it up, there comes this colored boot thing and after that nothing happens, the screen is black. i do not get any mouse or similar response when using keyboard and mouse. however, i can ssh to it and use it as i must without picture on the tv. if i put my pi in my old tv then there is no problem. i have checked the settings on the new tv and have been through it all without luck. the new tv does not write no signal unless i remove the hdmi cable from it. i really hope that someone can help me : build: fullpageos-jessie-lite-0.7.0_rc1 nightly pi version: 3 b new tv: philips 49pfs5301 old tv: samsung ue55h8005sq
