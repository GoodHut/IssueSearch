 URL : "https://github.com/rivine/rivine/issues/42" TITLE : improve gateway code BODY : after a discussion with the sia developers, it seems like i might be able to start improving the gateway code together with them, as a lot of what i had in mind was already on their todo list since a long time. their entire list can be found on https://github.com/nebulouslabs/sia/projects/2 here is what i propose to be working on, such that this can be merged asap to rivine: - integrate hashicorp/yamux into gateway, replacing muxado v1, which is outdated, not supported and potentially buggy issue 41 ; - improve documentation for the encoding, rpc and messaging. right now you have to almost reverse engineer what all the rpc operations are, how they are decoded and how they work. having documentation for this would help a lot for anyone to quickly jump into this code. on top of that it would also allow us to write clients in different languages easily, if this would be needed; - making sure two different networks running our code will not have their peer networks hooking together this would be done by having some kind of network id. related to nebulouslabs/sia issue 1480 ; - have a unique id per gateway and thus node and peer , this would allow gateways to detect whether they are connecting to themselves or not which is possible in case they are from the same home network, and thus having the same external ip ; - eclipse attacks + peer anchoring need to read up on this a lot, will link he papers as i do ; i'm in direct contact in a private chat with the 3 relevant core developers, so they will give me feedback as i go and help ensure the quality. in the future we might want to do extra changes _just_ in rivine, as those would break sia. however i think this would be enough to get us started, and is all in line with the sia version 1.3, planned to be released in 3-6 months.
