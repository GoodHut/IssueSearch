 URL : "https://github.com/dominic-ks/wp-api-js-sdk/issues/3" TITLE : logging out of the app BODY : there is currently no specific provision for logging out of the application, and it is unclear how this should be handled on the wordpress site with the currently authorised application. it would be possible to delete the stored credentials with localstorage.clear ; generically, or localstorage.remove ; but this will required you knowing the key where it is stored. currently this is 'wp_rest_app_your_app_id', which is set to allow multiple instances if required. once this information is deleted, any stored credentials can no longer be used as no one other than the wordpress site will know about them, so, while re-authorising is perfectly possible, logging in and out will create a large number of authorisation records for the same app in the users profile. this may not be an issue specifically but doesn't seem to be a tidy way of handling this. it could be possible to periodically remove the credentials from the wordpress site if they have not been used in x days.
