 URL : "https://github.com/tgwizard/sls/issues/360" TITLE : add support for r/a/dio BODY : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.r_a_d.radio https://github.com/r-a-dio/r-a-dio-amazing-android-app hopefully this is the proper way to request support for an app, assuming i can't personally add labels. you might possibly have to do any sort of testing at times when the bot dj hanyuu-sama is in charge, the human djs don't always broadcast the info needed to scrobble even in the direct audio stream i use on pc. you can see their rough schedule est at the top of the site: https://r-a-d.io/ but monday and wednesday normally have no human djs all day, with tuesday being a bit of a wildcard on when and which djs, if any. i don't really think i can contribute much else to help, but feel free to ask me if i could somehow.
