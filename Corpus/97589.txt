BODY : sometimes i find myself cheating and accessing a property without using case . i think i'm being very clever but it usually comes back to bite me, because that property may not exist, or the data model may change in the future and i am not forced to update my assumptions from the past. i think this would carry significant benefits and guarantees, but it would also make upgrading to the new version quite difficult. i think we may have to improve the case function to be a lot more expressive than it currently is before making this change. but i would really like to make it impossible to reach into the state of the object without a guarantee of a values existence enforced by sanctuary-def.
