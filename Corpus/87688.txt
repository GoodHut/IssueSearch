BODY : @andreasabel pointed out that agda does not satisfy a property that he attributed to frank pfenning i am not sure if my statement matches pfenning's : if you take a valid program and Î±-rename an identifier, then you should get an equivalent, valid program. in the case of agda you may get a program which is no longer valid. we could perhaps change agda so that pfenning's property holds by not allowing layout columns for multi-line layout blocks to start to the right of tokens other than keywords and special characters like . for some discussion of this issue, see 1832. see also 1145.
