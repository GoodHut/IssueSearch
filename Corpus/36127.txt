 URL : "https://github.com/ncw/rclone/issues/1232" TITLE : gcs permission issue BODY : when using a service account with gcs, it'd be nice to give the service account only storage object creater & viewer. unfortunately, one must currently also give it the project viewer role due to this function: https://github.com/ncw/rclone/blob/v1.35/googlecloudstorage/googlecloudstorage.go l456 this assumes a bucket get failure is due to the bucket not existing, when it is actually due to lack of permission even though one has permission to write to the bucket . i might send a pr to fix but don't count on it :
