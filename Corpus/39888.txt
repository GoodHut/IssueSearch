 URL : "https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-log4j2-appender/issues/4" TITLE : support for category BODY : hi. it would be nice, if the category could be configured with the appender config. this would allow having only one endpoint for different environments like dev, stg etc. this could be simply set on the appender using a log4j2 env variable or something. now i have to create one collector per environment an set the category there and have to pass the different collector endpoints per environment.
