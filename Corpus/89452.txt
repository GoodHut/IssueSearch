 URL : "https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_docker/issues/229" TITLE : python 3 py_image support BODY : the base image used for py_image uses python 2.7: https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_docker/blob/master/python/image.bzl l43 it would be nice to have a python 3 py_image rule available as well, rather than having to construct the rule manually using lower-level constructs. i realize the base images are grabbed from https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/distroless, and it doesn't yet look like they have a python 3 image available, so there's probably a bit of work involved here.
