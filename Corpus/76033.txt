 URL : "https://github.com/duguyue100/pycaer/issues/4" TITLE : improving event exporter BODY : current event exporter is basically a quick wrapper around the shared_ptr container. we will have to loop through the entire list of events so that it can convert to a vector based std container. this leads to potential memory leak and queue. e.g. cannot fetching events in full speed / lose some events. two questions to be answered: + in dvs128exporter and dynapexporter , we both used something like this to fetch a packet of events: c++ std::shared_ptr<eventpacket> packet = packetcontainer -1 ; will this contain all the events? + can pybind11 bind shared_ptr container which is not std ? and if no, is there more efficient way of converting eventpacket to standard container? @federicohyo
