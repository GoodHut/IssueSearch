 URL : "https://github.com/hypermodules/hyperamp/issues/173" TITLE : fix scroll bar repainting. BODY : the scroll bar repaints no matter what happens. this causes weird behavior with native macos scroll bars not that we are using them , but its also unnecessary. i think that we have some flapping dom nodes that constantly repaint even though they don't change. not sure the source of it. perhaps it has to do with this whitespace bug in nanomnorph i've heard murmurs of. i started a branch https://github.com/hypermodules/hyperamp/tree/fix-reflow to fix this.
