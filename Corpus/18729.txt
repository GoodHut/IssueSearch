 URL : "https://github.com/fxpio/composer-asset-plugin/issues/280" TITLE : update cli output BODY : while working on another pr i noticed some weird behavior of the cli output. a question in general: is the isverbose setting still needed or could most io related output controller with the verbosity setting? here's my wip: https://github.com/schmunk42/composer-asset-plugin/compare/feature/skip-asset-update...schmunk42:feature/update-output and here a screenshot how it looks with the changes above still need some minor tuning : ! bildschirmfoto 2017-03-08 um 08 52 01 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/649031/23694966/1fbfd40a-03dd-11e7-9b46-86292063e668.png a problem is, that tests would have to be adjusted here and there. let me know if you'd accept a pr with these updates 100% test-coverage then - or if there are problems i might not see. changes are basically just adjustments to verbosity level.
