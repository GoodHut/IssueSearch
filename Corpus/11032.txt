 URL : "https://github.com/FrSky-OS/X12S-bug-report/issues/129" TITLE : exmixer vs mixer BODY : why can not exmixer and mixer have the same functionality? with exmixer i can not concatenate several mixers with +=, = or :=. i can only do it in custom with mixer . but in custom i do not have the predefined mixers. if i define a model other than custom, i always reach a dead-end street. to do what i need i always have to use a custom model, it's like using opentx but without all its power. regards carlos pelayo
