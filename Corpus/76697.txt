 URL : "https://github.com/cirocosta/qcode-decoder/issues/45" TITLE : looking for a maintainer BODY : hey everyone, i suppose everyone noticed that i had no time to maintain the repository. constantly people ask for this but i can't do it now. recognizing this, i'd say that i'm totally open for giving the rights for those that might want to go through the issues/prs and improve the lib. if you feel you're up to do it, just tell me in this issue üòÅ thx for all of you who submitted prs / issues!
