 URL : "https://github.com/haodafan/CreateAndDestroySimple/issues/1" TITLE : pug is not functioning BODY : my application will always return an error caused by pug. i believe this has to do with the version of node i am running which, at work, is v0.12.2 , and not with my own code, because i have created a test script called attempt.js which does nothing except import the pug library, and it won't run either. i should test this at home where i have a newer version of node to verify this.
