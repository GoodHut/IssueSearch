 URL : "https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/4897" TITLE : crash on new resource page BODY : this seems to have been introduced by 4477. posting here reproduction instructions for @fivell :wink: git clone https://github.com/encomu/participa cd participa follow development setup instructions here https://github.com/encomu/participa/ instalaci%c3%b3n . i'm sorry we don't have something fully automatized. there's also a docker setup, but it hasn't been used in a while, you might want to try that as well. this is a standard rails application. after setup, edit gemfile to stop pinning activeadmin to the revision prior to 4477, and rebundle. start the application, login with the test admin account user: admin@example.com, pass: 111111 , and visit http://localhost:3000/admin/verification_centers/new. the app should crash. i'm sorry i don't have the time to provide a more isolated example at the moment...
