 URL : "https://github.com/jsdevkr/react-chatview/issues/31" TITLE : email from raksheet bhat BODY : hey, sorry to bother you like this, but i started using react-chatview recently and was wondering if you could provide an example to use 'returnscrollable' in reactchatview. the library is fantastic otherwise, and the only thing is that when new elements load in loadmorehistory , the scroll shifts down a few elements, which i want to avoid. thanks. regards, raksheet bhat.
