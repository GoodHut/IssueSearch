 URL : "https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-dupes/issues/725" TITLE : srm removed from sierra BODY : since the srm command was removed from macos sierra, i'm wondering if it make sense to either: - move srm to the hombrew-core repo? i'm not sure how this is handled for different versions of os', but it's no longer a dup for sierra and above or: - leave here but remove the keg_only attribute at least for sierra so that users do not have to force link, since it no longer interferes with the system install. or something else?
