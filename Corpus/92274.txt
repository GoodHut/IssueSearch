 URL : "https://github.com/keeweb/keeweb/issues/624" TITLE : webdav sync freezes often BODY : i'm using a self-hosted keeweb on my nas running ubuntu server 16.04 lts, accessing a webdav database located on the same nas. apache2 has been configured according to https://github.com/keeweb/keeweb/wiki/webdav-config. often when i try to save the database, the sync icon just stays there indefinitely i've waited up to 10 minutes and cpu usage stays very high until i close the browser tab. the database is not saved in this case. this happens in about 50% of my attempts to save the database. other times, it works fine. usually i'll just re-open the database and try saving it again. i'm having no problems accessing the webdav share with other applications. the bug might be related to safari, a quick test with ~10 saves has shown that there are no problems when using chrome. version info: keeweb v1.4.1 df218ae, 2017-03-26 environment: web user-agent: mozilla/5.0 macintosh; intel mac os x 10_12_4 applewebkit/603.1.30 khtml, like gecko version/10.1 safari/603.1.30 the app log's last entry is: debug 2017-05-15t13:20:49.605z storage-webdav save:put db/xxx/.db.kdbx.1494854449595 at which point it doesn't continue.
