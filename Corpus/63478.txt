 URL : "https://github.com/r888888888/danbooru/issues/3114" TITLE : duplicated pool version BODY : i don't know if this is the right place to write this or if it should go in the archives repository but every now and then i'm seeing duplicated versions in pools that are generated at the same time after creating a pool. for example: http://danbooru.donmai.us/pool_versions?search%5bpool_id%5d=12410 http://danbooru.donmai.us/pool_versions?search%5bpool_id%5d=12425 http://danbooru.donmai.us/pool_versions?search%5bpool_id%5d=12427 they all have the same date and time, i don't know what's the condition that generates the duplicated versions but it seems a little strange to me.
