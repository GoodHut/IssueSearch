 URL : "https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-codec-protobuf/issues/13" TITLE : protobuf support for 2.4? BODY : has the plugin been tested with logstash 2.4? there no documentation for it, based on debug logs, everything loads properly. i was playing around with logstash-output-stdout in order to test it out. i get no errors and @codec.on_event do |event, data| puts meow $stdout.write data end i never get my meow if i'm using protobuf codec. the logs say it finds my class file and my class just fine. it just doesn't get encoded or run the code it should once it does.
