i tried to add a name to the classification this morning for http://eulophiinae.e-monocot.org the name was eulophia huttonii. i encountered several errors during the process, including an ajax error message, and a 'url not found' message. i eventually added the name but couldn't move it to the correct position in the classification tree. i then abandoned this process. on refreshing the site it seems the entire classification has been lost. all that remains is a line with author names 'bosser & morat'.
