 URL : "https://github.com/jgraph/mxgraph/issues/44" TITLE : keyboard support disabling BODY : this is regarding the diagrameditor located in here https://jgraph.github.io/mxgraph/javascript/examples/editors/diagrameditor.html . keyboard shortcuts such as delete and undo is supported for this editor. you can select a cell and hit del key to delete and ctrl + z also do work. but if you view the source and come back again, those keys won't function. you can restore the functionalities by dropping a new cell from the pallet. otherwise non of the keys work. can we do something about this?
