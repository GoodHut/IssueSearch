 URL : "https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-storage-postgres/issues/2" TITLE : add initialization timeout BODY : hey, as discussed with @yasserf, it makes sense to add a timeout option to this connector. on connector initialization, the connector would try to connect to the db until the timeout is over, before throwing an error. the reason behind it is, that when using ds with postgres via docker docker-compose , the postgres instance inside the container needs a few seconds to actually boot up. right now, ds will shut down immediately because the connector can't connect to the db because it is still booting .
