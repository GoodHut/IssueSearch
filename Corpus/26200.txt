 URL : "https://github.com/skedgo/tripgo-api/issues/21" TITLE : adding account apis BODY : to proceed with tripgo wallet, i'm currently querying the following apis - api/user - account/alias can we please have these apis documented? also, is it possible that all account apis have the same entry point, perhaps api/user & apu/user/alias? just finding it weird to have two completely different urls to fetch more or less the same thing, e.g., info about a user.
