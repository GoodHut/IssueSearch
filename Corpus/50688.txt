 URL : "https://github.com/kiall/android-tvheadend/issues/118" TITLE : aac-latm audio support BODY : i've had a report via email about philips + shield tvs failing to a handle aac-latm audio tracks correctly. when these tracks are present, the video will freeze / pixelate etc, once filtered from tvheadend, the video will plan fine - without audio.
