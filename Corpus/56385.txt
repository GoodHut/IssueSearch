 URL : "https://github.com/quadshot/opentickets-community/issues/21" TITLE : multiple tickets issue BODY : when buying multiple tickets at once, all tickets are treated as the same ticket even though they have a different qr leading to a different url with a different qsot-checkin-packet. so each ticket can be used multiple times until the sum of all check-ins reaches the sum of the total number of tickets bought at once. shouldn't each ticket be limited to one check-in?
