 URL : "https://github.com/rnystrom/GitHawk/issues/620" TITLE : inbox tab redesign BODY : alongside 491, i'm going to update the inbox and remove the segmented control to switch between unread and all. instead, i'm going to default the list to be only unread and add a left nav item for all or maybe archived ? . this will: - simplify the vc - make toggling read/unread states bubbling up to the vc way simpler e.g. swipe action - make the app icon badge match exactly what is shown on launch same network request - simplify the ui no seg control
