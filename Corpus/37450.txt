 URL : "https://github.com/aura-project/melia/issues/101" TITLE : manage login history BODY : perhaps we should create a table that keeps a record of login history for each user. particularly, this is useful for the following reasons. - currently, nothing keeps track of which users are signed into a server or offline. this would be necessary to prevent duplicate clients from logging in with the same account. - with the cz_connect packet, we can store the hardware address and ip address of a user. that can be used for ban implementations in the future. downsides: - any table that tracks history can become large very quickly. server operators might need to create an event to flush out old data.
