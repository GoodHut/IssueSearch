 URL : "https://github.com/CakeDC/oven/issues/9" TITLE : possibility to have this BODY : i see some great suggestions here, like db configuration and plugins installation. in addition it would be a huge plus if i can have this cloned in a fixed location somewhere within my development server ie. /var/www/cakephp-oven/oven.php and allow me to create many cakephp installs from this location. the idea is to have it ask me where i would like my project to be created, like /var/www/website1.com or /var/www/website2.com .
