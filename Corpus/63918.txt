 URL : "https://github.com/Razish/japp/issues/412" TITLE : failed to load init.lua BODY : hi all, i'm just toying with this mod. i've cloned the repository, and build it from source on an x86_64 linux box, and installed it alongside openjk - specifically; openjk is installed under $gamedata = /usr/local/jediacademy this is its gamedata folder , copied the japlus/ .so to ${gamedata}/japlus/ , and have also copied the usual shared libraries to ~/.local/share/openjk/{base/,japlus/} . when i start my own local server just to toy with the ja++ client, i'm not sure how to use either the server or the client , i see the following error / warning in my terminal when invoking ${gamedata}/openjk.x86_64 when my current working directory is $gamedata : ... vm_create: uix86_64.so succeeded vm_create: cgamex86_64.so succeeded logging to logs/cl/console.log logging to logs/cl/chat.log not logging debug messages to disk. logging to logs/cl/security.log server support hints: 0x5f ...loaded 5153 faces, 15 meshes, 12 trisurfs, 11 flares ^2jplua:^1 failed to load main scripts: lua/init.lua loadfile: failed to load lua/init.lua, file doesn't exist should this be of concern? i haven't seen a drastic change in the gameplay of ja yet, so i'm not sure if this mod is working this is my first time using it . i've also tried to download & copy the client enable new ja++ features from the landing page, to ${gamedata}/cljapp.cfg i'm not sure where this actually belongs . but, i've also tried doing a find -f |grep init.lua in the japlus repo, and haven't found anything. thank you in advance for your help!!
