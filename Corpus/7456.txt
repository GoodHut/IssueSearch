 URL : "https://github.com/ethercreative/seo/issues/49" TITLE : fr yoast import BODY : would love the ability to import focus keywords and perhaps other meta from yoast. i recently pulled out all the focus keywords from our posts/pages in wordpress via the following mysql query: select wp_posts.post_title, wp_posts.id, wp_posts.guid, mt1.meta_value as focus_keyword from wp_posts left join wp_postmeta as mt1 on wp_posts.id = mt1.post_id and mt1.meta_key='_yoast_wpseo_focuskw' where wp_posts.post_type = 'page' or wp_posts.post_type = 'post' and wp_posts.post_status = 'publish' or wp_posts.post_status = 'private' group by wp_posts.id order by wp_posts.post_date desc this will give me a good list to import into craft, but i'd love the opportunity to have this be a little bit more straight forward. in fact, even if this were part of the readme, where you could give mysql statements that would give an example way to import these, that would be amazing.
