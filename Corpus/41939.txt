 URL : "https://github.com/fuzionnz/nz.co.fuzion.transactional/issues/16" TITLE : add settings metadata BODY : this extension uses setting.create , so it should have settings metadata https://docs.civicrm.org/dev/en/master/framework/setting/ creating-a-new-setting-in-an-extension we were seeing odd errors stemming from a recent type hint change in crm-20837 that would throw a fatal error when the setting api was used. there was a followup fix from seamus which attempted to handle this, but the error magically cleared itself up when i tried to reproduce. which made it hard to confirm the fix!
