 URL : "https://github.com/Laharah/deluge-uTorrentImport/issues/10" TITLE : possible sync option BODY : i do not know where suggestion section is so i post it here, thx can you make deluge sync with utorrent every x seconds? would basically be just clicking the button automaticly. make plugin find downloads with just downloading metadata and also import those this is the real reason i need this plugin. all my torrents get stuck on metadata would be awesome if you could do this, tough i do not know if this is possible. as i am no expert in the magical, mystical art that you gods posses coding .
