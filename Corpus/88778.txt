 URL : "https://github.com/javalite/jar-explorer/issues/10" TITLE : options dialog to be done BODY : i just thought i've broken something but it is actually in the code... i guess the options dialog would have at least the current settings from the configuration in and maybe filtering options. is there anything else that comes to mind? if the option dialog is expected tbd for the next months, too then it would be reasonable to deactivate the menu entry until then.
