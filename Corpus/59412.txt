 URL : "https://github.com/ollef/sixten/issues/42" TITLE : typo ? in license file BODY : hi! just saw your project on r/haskell; i have to admit it looks pretty cool as an enthusiast :smile:. looking at the license, i think you're going for bsd 3-clause license but the third line https://github.com/ollef/sixten/blob/da44703796b59aa71430aabe3f34163ec666fed9/license l3 doesn't seem quite right ... is that a typo?
