 URL : "https://github.com/skeskali/MPFormLetters/issues/1" TITLE : form letter frame BODY : hey, this is super useful! i was actually working on something related yesterday, but i was thinking more of the frame for the letter or a phone call script, and less of the content itself. i don’t really have any experience or knowledge on writing letters to mps, what you’ve done is the more important part. would you be interested having the site i made auto-fill in some details for your form letters for people? demo: ! call-your-mp-1 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1581276/22416769/65653c2c-e685-11e6-8668-02395d401d94.gif https://call-your-mp.surge.sh basically it’s just a phone call template, but it’ll fill in your mp’s info using your current location. the official postal code search gets the job done, but i thought it was nice to have it integrated into the call script and then potentially make it one button to send an email version as well . i have the initial version live at call-your-mp.surge.sh https://call-your-mp.surge.sh , and my plan was to open source it anyway. either my project could pull in your markdown templates somehow, or i could hard-code them for now, or something else. let me know if that’s interesting to you at all! thanks either way.
