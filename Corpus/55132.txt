 URL : "https://github.com/stil4m/elm-analyse/issues/105" TITLE : import dependency tree BODY : i wonder if it's easy to get a tree representation of all the modules that import other modules so we can see when a certain module is changed, which other modules have to recompile. in our project, we have over 300 files and recompiles are costly bottlenecks of the workflow. love your work btw!
