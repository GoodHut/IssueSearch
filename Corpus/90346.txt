 URL : "https://github.com/WhitestormJS/whitestorm-typescript-boilerplate/issues/2" TITLE : server hot reload and ssr BODY : i just started to move to typescript, and found this boilerplate to be very nice and similar to what i've been using previously with flow https://github.com/zhenyulin/ultimate-hot-boilerplate during the process of set it up, i also find some features can be further added, e.g. server-side hot reload, and ssr, would be happy to make contribution here, but would be great to have some initial direction. currently, it seems i'm not able to use es6 module import on the server side yet. while tslint-loader is set up on the client side webpack config, the server file is also hooked on it in some way. would be great to have an idea of how this part is structured.
