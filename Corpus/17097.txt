 URL : "https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-kibana-app/issues/23" TITLE : new index pattern BODY : hello guys! could you consider creating another index besides wazuh-alerts automatically? i would like wazuhapp already to create an index for the file /var/ossec/logs/archives/archives.json. another doubt. if i use the wazuhapp plugin i still need to use template => /etc/logstash/wazuh-elastic5-template.json in the logstash configuration, since the wazuh app automatically creates the index? i used it in my logstash configuration and the following occurred: wazuhapp created the wazuh-alerts index with all the fields with the searchable and aggregatable options checked, until then all ok. after a while i updated the index on the management page and in most of the fields the options searchable and aggregatable disappeared.
