 URL : "https://github.com/hanwen/go-fuse/issues/183" TITLE : enable trash on macos BODY : i'm using gocryptfs https://github.com/rfjakob/gocryptfs , which relies on your library for file system operations. is there a way to enable macos trash functionality for fuse volumes? otherwise it's rather inconvenient to have those constant verification popups on every delete operation. thanks
