 URL : "https://github.com/elear/mtgvenue/issues/26" TITLE : must if enough time BODY : in section 5 of -06, we have this: > when there is enough time to do so, the iaoc must consult the community about changes. that reads like must except when you don't have to , which isn't really must at all. i suggest this alternative: when there is enough time to do so, the iaoc is expected to consult the community about such changes.
