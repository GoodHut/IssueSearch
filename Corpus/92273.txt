 URL : "https://github.com/amosavian/FileProvider/issues/27" TITLE : webdav file path question BODY : so i've started playing with the webdav file provider, to see how that fares, and i ran into a bit of an issue or question really. say i make a call to list the contents of a directory with a path: /data/hello/settings/background everything works, and looks ok, at first glance. except if i look at the relative path of the fileobjects i got back, its got paths like: /remote.php/dav/files/skela/remote.php/dav/files/skela/data/hello/settings/background/portrait_phones.pdf that to me seems wrong, for instance in dropbox, all the paths are relative and would be for example: /data/hello/settings/background/portrait_phones.pdf is this a design choice, or a possible issue ? just asking because it feels wrong to me. again, really appreciate the work you do on this library!
