 URL : "https://github.com/Dnawrkshp/ArtemisPS3/issues/11" TITLE : artemis r1 BODY : i'm running artemis r1 version on my ps3, and that version still has the l3 + r3 combo to attach, but i can't find out what the combo is to detach, required to do with constant write codes during loading screens. otherwise the game freezes. so does anyone still have the r1 source or know the detach combo? also, ever thought about having multiple combo's for different cheats? as in, make two combo's and allow us to select under which one the cheat activates. that would be perfect for on / off single write cheat codes. but in the meantime, being able to turn off constant write codes would be nice. and i would update to r5 and use the start and select button but i haven't had any success with r5, r3, r4, whatever versions there were, in the past. r1 was the only working one. i love this app, and it saves me so much time and hassle, that i don't need to rtm at all anymore.
