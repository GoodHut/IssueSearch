 URL : "https://github.com/dresser/SitecoreEzImporter/issues/3" TITLE : import command not working BODY : thanks for the ezimporter module. i installed it in my local dev vm and was able to run the importer manually with the sample cars-1.0.0.xlsx just fine against v8.2.5. after that, i created a command using import command trying to use the same cars-1.0.0.xlsx with some minor modifications to price on one item, added a new item, created a scheduler to run every 5 minutes. it looks like the scheduler is calling the command but the additions/revisions were not being made to the corresponding items in sitecore. any help would be appreciated. thanks, chandra
