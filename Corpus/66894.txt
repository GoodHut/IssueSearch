 URL : "https://github.com/Malalicious/Serenity/issues/18" TITLE : not really functioning! BODY : i understand basically the most part of code mousehelper, aimbot,and i use to test firstly in training mode, works pretty good ,but it doesn't work at all in normal search ,this issue is probably related with some of method of the screen capture.i guess it could be overwatch team ,locking the screenshot function during the normal game search ,and allows capture for streamers to streaming. well,think it can't capture any image while normal game accept training ,so that the solution doesn't work at time.
