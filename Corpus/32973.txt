 URL : "https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/issues/1880" TITLE : 1.5 ergonomic issues BODY : stemmed from a conversation with @joeyzwicker. basically now that we are seeing a lot of production usage, it's a good time to start making a serious effort at making pachyderm more ergonomic. a couple issues that were brought up during the conversation: from_commit : currently it's practically useless as each commit captures the entire state of the repo, so in an append-heavy workload, processing a single head commit is basically equivalent to processing all commits. visibility into open commits. currently if you mess up an open commit e.g. a file upload fails midway through , there's very little you can do about it. save the output of a job that failed. if you have a job that's been running for days and failed in the last second, you'd ideally be able to save whatever data it's processed. but right now only successful jobs have output commits.
