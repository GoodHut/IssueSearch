 URL : "https://github.com/simpeg/simpeg/issues/575" TITLE : octree model sections BODY : i have set up a small problem for testing the regularization operators on an octree mesh using a dc problem. this small problem ~50,000 cells inverts in about 10 min but it takes almost as long for it to generate a 3 panel plot of model sections. i'm assuming this has something to do with interpolation. any thoughts on how we could potentially speed this up?
