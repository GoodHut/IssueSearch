 URL : "https://github.com/videojs/videojs-contrib-ads/issues/242" TITLE : flash of content on play BODY : i am using google videojs-ima master in conjunction with this library 4.2.3 . upon clicking play, i see a bit of content flash before the preroll starts. i am using playsinline on ios 10. i am able to experience less occurrences of flash if i change this line of code: https://github.com/videojs/videojs-contrib-ads/blob/master/src/cancelcontentplay.js l21. i change the check to player.el_.hasattribute 'playsinline' instead of !player.el_.hasattribute 'playsinline' . i also see the above comment has ...iphones on ios10 with playsinline which makes it peculiar that there would be a negation in the check. may i be missing something? with that change, most of the time there is no flash but still on some attempts there is a tiny bit of a content flash. without the change, however, the flash happens consistently. final note that i modified google videojs-ima to trigger an adstart event, per the discussion at https://github.com/videojs/videojs-contrib-ads/issues/191. now i am just trying to update all the libraries and want to get a solid playback experience.
