 URL : "https://github.com/kangax/fabric.js/issues/4183" TITLE : fonts naming bug? BODY : <!-- bug template --> version 2.0.0-beta3 test case - non-working font: http://jsfiddle.net/vvl6f/171/ http://jsfiddle.net/vvl6f/171/ - working font: http://jsfiddle.net/vvl6f/172/ http://jsfiddle.net/vvl6f/172/ steps to reproduce open the non-working font fiddle, resize the text so the font is refreshed because it probably was not loaded before the canvas rendered, the font is not the desired one. now open the working font fiddle and do the same, the font is the intended one. the only change is in the font family name replacing & by and . expected behavior the font should render correctly with the & in the font family name. actual behavior the font won't render with an & in the font family name, is this a fabric.js issue or a canvas issue? are there any other characters that could exhibit the same behavior? i couldn't find anything related information.
