 URL : "https://github.com/ad3002/Cookiecutter/issues/23" TITLE : remove compilation error BODY : hi, when compiling from the clone i noticed a couple of things: 1. makefile has commands for target remove twice, so the binary is not compiled: remove: remove.cpp $ obj $ cxx $ cxxflags -o remove remove.cpp $ obj remove: counter.cpp $ obj $ cxx $ cxxflags -o counter counter.cpp $ obj >$ make makefile:37: warning: overriding commands for target remove' makefile:34: warning: ignoring old commands for target remove' 2. when i change this, remove is still not compiled. output: remove.cpp: in function ‘int main int, char ’: remove.cpp:215:9: error: ‘gzfile’ was not declared in this scope gzfile fp; ^ remove.cpp:215:16: error: expected ‘;’ before ‘fp’ gzfile fp; ^ remove.cpp:216:9: error: ‘kseq_t’ was not declared in this scope kseq_t seq; ^ remove.cpp:216:17: error: ‘seq’ was not declared in this scope kseq_t seq; ^ remove.cpp:217:17: error: ‘buf’ was not declared in this scope kseq_t buf = 0; i can remove the offending lines and remove then compiles, but i doubt this is a good fix. however as i only want to use the extract function it is ok for now. thanks
