 URL : "https://github.com/nsperrin/GroupMeBookMaker/issues/5" TITLE : mockup html: image posts BODY : we should add example image groupme posts that have images followed by the text of the post. this is part of the process of making a generic groupme post that we can build off of to practice styling. this task will be complete when we have at least one example image post. the image should be styled in such a way to make it have a max size, similar to how groupme does it. being precise about sizing can come later.
