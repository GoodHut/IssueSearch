 URL : "https://github.com/angular/flex-layout/issues/446" TITLE : add an issue template BODY : according to the wiki https://github.com/angular/flex-layout/wiki/contributing-to-angular-2-flex-layout -submitting-an-issue , there is some specific information that would help the developers with dealing/triaging new issues, which are listed out; however, when i go to create a new issue, i don't see this information, because there isn't an issue_template for the project. adding a issue template would thus aid the project for users who haven't seen that section of the wiki which isn't very visible to begin with and to help create a better issue description.
