 URL : "https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi/issues/42" TITLE : global variable undefined BODY : the tutorials and examples work fine, but i'm having issues with my own code. if i declare the global variables after g.start like the tutorial , they get overwritten after that method to undefined, by their own declaration. and i can't access their value on the play method. example: let g = hexi 512, 512, setup ; g.scaletowindow ; g.start ; let player, gamescene; function setup { gamescene = g.group ; player = g.rectangle 48, 48, blue ; player.x = g.canvas.width / 2 - player.halfwidth; player.y = g.canvas.height / 2 - player.halfheight; gamescene.addchild player ; g.state = play; } function play { console.log player: , player ; // outputs 'player: undefined' } looks like the g.start calls the setup function before i declare the global variables, and when it's done, it goes back into the declaration block let player, gamescene; , setting them to undefined. i confirmed this using browser debugging tool. so my workaround is to declare the global variables before g.start , and it works fine for now. but something is smelly here, why the tutorials and example works, and my own code doesn't? i already tried different setups, separated hexi modules and core, changed babel preset, but still no success. it gave me a serious headache, i had to submit this issue.
