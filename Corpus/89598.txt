 URL : "https://github.com/Chisel-Team/Chisel/issues/578" TITLE : re-add chisel mode in gui BODY : hey there, so my suggestion is to re-add the chisel modes within the gui. it seemed to be a lot easier. or maybe even an enhancement to shift and scroll while holding the diamond chisel in your hotbar to change modes. i'm being a bit picky with this but would it be possible to add a higher radius to chisel as well? example: 5x5 thanks for taking the time to read this, hope to hear back soon!
