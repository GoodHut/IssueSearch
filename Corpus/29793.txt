 URL : "https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/picongpu/issues/2146" TITLE : more version output BODY : from 867 to do: - x make more generic, so it can also be used for output files - use in output files: https://github.com/openpmd/openpmd-standard/issues/137 - call should not return not as -h so it can be called in a single mpiexec - it might be cool to output that before each rank from rank zero - move output into own file might avoid change to .cu which was necessary for cuda_version output - add icet version - add picongpu and libpmacc log levels - compare to cuda rt & output cuda driver - add __time__ and __date__ and author of compile process - hostname and username on the current machine - if compiled via configure , we could add if a -t case from cmakeflags was used or even better, we store the cmake_flags from configure 1100
