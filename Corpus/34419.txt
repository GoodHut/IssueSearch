 URL : "https://github.com/Luffyyy/HoloUI/issues/19" TITLE : change fonts for hud BODY : i'm currently using a chinese localization mod to play the game, and while holoui works without major problems here, some parts of hud can't display chinese fonts correctly, such as current task and other player's name. i'm wondering if you can add an option to force the hud to use default font?
