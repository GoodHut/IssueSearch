 URL : "https://github.com/arielsanchezmora/vDocumentation/issues/25" TITLE : update module scaffolding BODY : ideally it would be awesome to get this in a ci/cd pipeline. i suggest and will add a pr updating to a new scaffolding that will jive directly with appveyor. this will auto-deploy when desired to the ps gallery. each commit will build in appveyor and report any findings. also update the module and functions to pass psscriptanalyzer.
