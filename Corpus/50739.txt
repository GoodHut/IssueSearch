 URL : "https://github.com/liqd/a4-meinberlin/issues/948" TITLE : activate cache busting BODY : django has built-in cachebusting via manifeststaticfilesstorage https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/contrib/staticfiles/ manifeststaticfilesstorage . afaik we already use collectstatic in production, so it would be a simple matter of adding the following line to production.py: staticfiles_storage = 'django.contrib.staticfiles.storage.manifeststaticfilesstorage' however, i got the following error: valueerror: the file 'a4images/imageuploader.js' could not be found with <django.contrib.staticfiles.storage.manifeststaticfilesstorage object at 0x7f5f3d33c780>. i got it to work by running collectstatic first with the default storage and than again with this one. but i don't think this is how it was intended to be used.
