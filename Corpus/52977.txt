 URL : "https://github.com/javiereguiluz/EasyAdminBundle/issues/1843" TITLE : custom form - best way BODY : i have a list of 30 employees in database. every employee has it's monthly salary which has some constant values and some values may vary regarding of month let's say number of working days or anything else, doesn't matter what i have to do is create new action, prefill, whose job should be prefilling form with data from last salary for user linked with that salary it's time consuming job to enter every value every time . since i have 30 employees, in current state on edit action, employees are dropdown, so prefill should implement ajax call on that dropdown so i don't have to care about salary i clicked and therefore user linked with that salary and i can just pick employee from dropdown, ajax returns last salary for picked employee, i change what has to be changed and on save it creates new salary object. what would be the best way to do that? i have created custom action on list view but creating form is bugging me. - creating custom form by writing my own html, rendering it in admincontroller render and passing needed variables - copy/paste of existing edit form in new template, adjusting it and writing only ajax code inside of it and doing rest of logic in admincontroller render and passing needed variables - something else smarter and more elegant?
