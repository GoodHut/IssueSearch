 URL : "https://github.com/gonetz/GLideN64/issues/1521" TITLE : 2 zelda oot problems BODY : 1st using the latest version of gliden64 and this happens. ! zelda oot sun texture problem https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15960656/27872951-20366336-6170-11e7-8d13-07f21fb8c97d.png this never happen in the glide64 or the glide64 napalm wx version all the other textures load properly aside from the sun texture and was wondering why is this a problem now? 2nd why is when using per-pixel lighting slower in fullscreen then windowed. my desktop computer is a beefy machine that can run games like devil may cry 4 special edtion on max settings just fine so per-pixel lighting on your plugin shouldn't be an issue but it is. is there any updates in like the wip builds that supposedly fixes these 2 issues?
