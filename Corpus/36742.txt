 URL : "https://github.com/ksonnet/ksonnet/issues/217" TITLE : implement ks install BODY : per 204, users who are cloning a repository right now would be expected to check in ksonnet-lib, which is ~1.7mb. a better idea would be to implement ks install , which would act like npm install , specifically: - generating ksonnet-lib for each envvironment, possibly lazily as they are used - lazily instantiating registries as we need them
