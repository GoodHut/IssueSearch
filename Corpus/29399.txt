 URL : "https://github.com/BanManagement/BanManager/issues/727" TITLE : listening to events BODY : i want to listen to any event in which a player is or could potentially be banned. i notice that you have events that seem to be very similar except some are past tense and some are present tense, i'd like to know the difference so i don't listen to both if needed or the wrong set of events. also i do know after a certain amount of warns a temp ban could be issued. would that launch a ban event or should i listen to the warn events?
