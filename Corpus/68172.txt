 URL : "https://github.com/codalab/codalab-cli/issues/758" TITLE : remove worker checkouts BODY : the world is a dark place. bad things happen -- this is especially the case with distributed systems. workers can die without warning and we need to be prepared for that. no one wants to have to wait 6 hours before a stuck running bundle can be deleted either. no one should have to make sure their worker checks out when it exits -- that's too much responsibility for any person.
