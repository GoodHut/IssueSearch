 URL : "https://github.com/ropensci/rnoaa/issues/194" TITLE : access sea ice csv data? BODY : looks like we can access the shapefiles, but it would be nice to just get the sea ice time-series data as well, e.g. ftp://sidads.colorado.edu/datasets/noaa/g02135/north/monthly/data/ ideally the function would aggregate the separate monthly or daily files into single timeseries dataframe.
