 URL : "https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/ATSC/issues/55" TITLE : publicly submitted issue BODY : submitter: mickaël raulet email: m.raulet@ateme.com i have questions regarding hfr as it is in s34-1 specification. is this prohibited for hfr to be deployed in a dual track approach? •	a dual track approach would allow a service provider to easily switch from sfr to hfr without looking into the elementary stream. it may be more restrictive in the sense in the specification, is it prohibited for a service provider to dynamically change from sfr to hfr within a service? each temporal layer can be put in different dash tracks, can’t it? section 5.3.2.7 and 5.3.2.8 of http://dashif.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/dash-if-iop-for-atsc3-0-v1.0.pdf <quote> when temporal sub-layering is applied and all samples for both temporalid=0 and 1 are carried in a single track, the track shall contain sample group description box containing sample group entry type 'tscl' and corresponding sample to group box which as signs a sample group for each sample within that track. <\quote> it means both are possible – single and dual tracks. is there another document that i shall refer to?
