 URL : "https://github.com/influxdata/ifql/issues/176" TITLE : add loadsecret function BODY : the overall system will have a place for storing secrets. users will be able to set secrets via api and they will be stored in some secret store like vault or something else. in ifql users will be able to load secrets for configurations. for example, in slack configurations, the url contains secret information. you would do that like this: .outputslack url: loadsecret name: myslackurl , channel: general , message: foo bar the loadsecret function will pull the secret from the system configured secret store. later we may add options to change the source with a source parameter.
