 URL : "https://github.com/luarocks/luarocks/issues/671" TITLE : luarocks the build-system BODY : this is something i've talked about before, but i can't find where we might have been tracking the discussion, please point me to it if you know the ability that luarocks provides for projects to specify how to build lua libraries in a common format is very valuable. for cooperating with my distro package manager, i'd like to be able to use luarocks as a build-tool, without the run-time package management component. practically, i think this might be as simple as adding a flag for make / build / install that indicates to not install the rockspec, manifest or other files into $tree/lib/luarocks such as the copy of the doc directory .
