 URL : "https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/issues/4180" TITLE : width of way elements BODY : hello, is it possible to access/calculate the width of an area in osrm when there is no width tag? as far as i know streets, railtracks, waterways are mapped as area. i believe this information needs to be somewhere to render the maps correctly even if you don't specifically add a tag. the question is if you can create a routing where wider roads are preferred over smaller ones. thanks in advance for any help!
