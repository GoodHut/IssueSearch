 URL : "https://github.com/Taracque/cordova-plugin-braintree/issues/16" TITLE : ios releasing - bundle id BODY : hi. when i'm trying to upload my app to appstore, it thows and error ! 00000 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13046798/24658252/df49f84e-1951-11e7-82a2-06a14498315e.jpg as i understand it becomes because it can't substitutes ${product_bundle_identifier}.payments in cordova-plugin-braintree/scripts/add_embedded_ios_frameworks.js row 166 and 176. i fixed it by manualy adding bundle_id in product bundle identifier of build settings. is that how it works?
