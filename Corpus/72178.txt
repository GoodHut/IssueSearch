 URL : "https://github.com/reactstrap/reactstrap/issues/721" TITLE : basic grid doesn't work? BODY : full disclosure, i am a newbie at this. if i am doing something wrong, please advise. this traditionally would work and provide a responsive layout, such when the user resizes the browser to the medium size, the content in the second column would flow beneath the content in the first column. html <div class= container-fluid > <div class= row > <div class= col-md-6 > some content </div> <div class= col-md-6 > some content </div> </div> </div> when trying to replicate this in reactstrap as follows: html <container fluid> <row> <col md= 6 > some content </col> <col md= 6 > some content </col> </row> </container> <col md= 6 > results in <div class= col col-md-6 > . this does not function as expected. the two columns remain side by side no matter the size of the viewport. is there a workaround other than creating the grid using classname?
