 URL : "https://github.com/ca98am79/connect-dynamodb/issues/46" TITLE : block when creating table BODY : when connect-dynamodb creates the table for the first time, it logs the result of the request out to console.log. is this correct behavior? doesn't it need to block somehow until the creation of the table is complete? i understand this would require some work on the api, but it also seems like a race condition on whether the table gets created before connect-dynamodb uses it. https://github.com/ca98am79/connect-dynamodb/blob/master/lib/connect-dynamodb.js l69-l89
