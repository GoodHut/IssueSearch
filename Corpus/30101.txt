 URL : "https://github.com/Shadowss/TravianZ/issues/281" TITLE : normalize db tables BODY : there are tables that perform joins on fields which reference each other but are of a different type. for instance, we would have int 11 field of village id referencing another village id field in another table, but that second field is a varchar 255 . for this, indexes cannot be used and it slows down queries.
