 URL : "https://github.com/SandSnip3r/RandomPostfixEquation/issues/1" TITLE : 4 terms less BODY : just by looking at the expression, one can easily reduce it to: 69 69 / 69 69 + 69 420 69 69 69 / 69 + + 69 420 + - / 69 / 69 420 420 + / / - 16 terms 69 69 / 69 69 + 420 420 420 + 420 69 - 69 69 / - 69 / + 12 terms efficient exhaustive enumeration is rather easy to do just keep an open/closed list, runs in time o nÂ² with n discovered partial expressions . however, it's not so trivial to enumerate them in such a way that the shortest possible representation will be found. would you be interested in a pr that does that?
