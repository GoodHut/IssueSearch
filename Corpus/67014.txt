BODY : i'm running an old version of spotify 0.9.15.27.g87efe634 , and i would love an app like this one. however, when i run spotispy, it just says waiting for spotify... see screenshot . i'm guessing it is because i run an old version of spotify, or does it support older versions as well? tried to run the exe before and after starting spotify, on my laptop and desktop pc, no change. do you just boot it up and wait? are there no settings or anything like that? sorry if i'm missing something obvious here, i know nothing of code or coding. grateful for any kind of response. ! spotispy https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30534846/28732006-7c6a13aa-73d6-11e7-87e2-28a6eca28c4d.png
