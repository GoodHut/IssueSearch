 URL : "https://github.com/portux/NAJU-Adebar/issues/17" TITLE : speed up filters BODY : currently when applying a filter basically a list of all available person objects will be created. afterwards the instances which are actually needed will be selected, using application-level functions. however it would be pretty nice already to perform most of the filtering at database-level. this would not only be a much cleaner approach, but would also speed up the reponse time greatly.
