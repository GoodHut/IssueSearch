 URL : "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/issues/7331" TITLE : rfc: lorawan in riot BODY : hi community. we just had a meeting with @aabadie, @adjih and @fjmolinas to discuss about the possible next stages for lorawan on riot. @aabadie is proposing to add lmic https://github.com/mirakonta/lmic as a pkg the ibm original link seems to be broken . although it has minimal functionalities,it covers class a and b devices and 868-915 mhz bands. on the other side, @fjmolinas and me originally tried to port semtech loramac-node https://github.com/lora-net/loramac-node as a pkg, but we ended rewriting half of the code due to problems with ota and code logic https://github.com/lora-net/loramac-node/issues/173 , lack of an abstraction layer and redundancy with riot components. we already deployed a riot + lorawan project with this code in the 6645 pr and did some tests. worked for a month sending packets every 30 secs! class a, ota, unconfirmed messages at this point we don't suggest trying to port semtech loramac-node as a pkg, but wanted to know your opinion in continuing the development of gnrc_lorawan to make it a riot component rather than an external pkg. the main drawback is the difficulty of adding new features and mantaining, but a custom code can give more control . tl;dr opinions on adding ibm lmic as a pkg and also continue the development of a riot's own lorawan stack in 6645 . cheers!
