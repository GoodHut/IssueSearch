 URL : "https://github.com/oryfoxer7410/1.10.2-Pack/issues/83" TITLE : 0.1.9.9 server download BODY : i have been running a server on this modpack now for a month or so and have had little to no issues. we attempted to update to 0.1.9.9, and the upload link on the website http://www.infernoworldorder.com/ appears to be linked to the new lite modpack server download, so i am unable to update the server. also-in the process i updated my modpack to test the server, and once i realized that the server wasn't working, i was unable to downgrade to the past running version, or any other version. there is some error downloading the server list mod. thanks, and please excuse my run-on sentences and etc grammar issues.
