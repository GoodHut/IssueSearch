 URL : "https://github.com/GreatEmerald/UT3Vehicles/issues/114" TITLE : goliath tank shell BODY : - visual effects related - the shell in ut3 has smoke instead of the yellow trail ut2004 has, i can't see the shell but if i recall it was a ut3 rocket in ut3 and in ut2004 it's a ut2004 rocket - tank shell in ut3 has a different and longer explosion sound as well as orange and red visual - ut2004 has a more interesting muzzle flash than ut3 but ut3 has smoke from the barrel more accurately that lingers during it's reload time, would it be possible to combine these traits as i think the ut2004 muzzle flash is better but the barrel smoke is better in ut3
