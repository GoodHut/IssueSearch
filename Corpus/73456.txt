 URL : "https://github.com/tombatossals/angular-openlayers-directive/issues/354" TITLE : create layer dinamically BODY : hi, is it possible to create a layer dinamically in the controller and add it to the rest layers? i can't create it when the app starts up because i don't have the source until the user selects some parameters, is it possible? perhaps through the openlayers native code? oldata.getmap .then function map { var layers = map.getlayers ;... //something as layers.push new layer... thanks in advance
