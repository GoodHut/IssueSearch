 URL : "https://github.com/JackBuck/Robo-Plot/issues/133" TITLE : soft limit bugs BODY : several bugs: - the axis.home_position and axis.upper_limit are class variables where they should be instance variables - the soft limit tests set axis.current_position where they should set axis.current_location - the soft limit tests use the hardware module, and so should be prepared for any set-up which may be present there. currently these tests hack the _valid_range of the limit switches to things like 5, infinity which are intolerant to the current_location set in the hardware module. indeed, on the pen lifting branch 35 the tests fail because the home_location has been calibrated at 3mm, causing the initial current_location with simulated hardware to be 6,6 , which is outside the valid range of some of the limit switches. there may be more bugs found once these are fixed!
