 URL : "https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer/issues/830" TITLE : not creating any prefixes BODY : i've used this plugin in several projects before and i've never had any problems. however, all of a sudden no prefixes are being added. in previous projects i never had to add the browserlist section in my package.json but since i'm having problems i added this time and i'm still not seeing prefixes. i'm using postcss with this plugin. this is what i have in my gruntfile: postcss: { options: { map: true, processors: require 'autoprefixer' { browsers: 'last 2 versions' } , // add vendor prefixes }, src: 'stylesheets/css/styles.min.css' }, and this is the browserlist section in my package.json file: browserslist : > 1% , last 2 versions , ie 6-8 , >= 5% , ie 6-8 i've tried replacing last 2 versions with >= 5% but i got this error: fatal error: unknown browser query >= 5% am i doing something wrong? as i said i've used this tool before with no problems whatsoever. any help would be appreciated. thanx
