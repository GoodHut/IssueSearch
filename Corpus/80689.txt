 URL : "https://github.com/BelledonneCommunications/linphone/issues/29" TITLE : update call audio params BODY : is it possible to add an ability to update audio params as well by calling linphone_call_update linphonecall.c ? now it's just updating a video params and ignoring an audio ones. the problem is, that i'm starting a call with 'inactive' audio direction, and then i need to switch the audio direction to 'sendrcv' without re-invitation.
