 URL : "https://github.com/PomeloFoundation/Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql/issues/287" TITLE : 2.0.0 unit tests update BODY : lots has changed in upstream 2.0.0. the dev branch now tracks 2.0.0-preview3- from aspnet/entityframework's myget feed. i have updated the unit test code, but there is some failures that need to be investigated and fixed: total tests: 57. passed: 43. failed: 13. skipped: 1. specifically one thing that has changed is the way to mark properties for value generated on add/update, so i had to comment out all lines in the test that look like this: // mysqlannotationnames.prefix + mysqlannotationnames.valuegeneratedonadd = true need to figure out new way that this is handled in 2.0.0 and source of other unit test failures.
