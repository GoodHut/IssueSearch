 URL : "https://github.com/andreafabrizi/Dropbox-Uploader/issues/358" TITLE : sync remote dropbox BODY : forgive me if i've missed a feature, but is there any simple way of keeping the remote dropbox directories and files up to date with local files and directories, using dropbox uploader? i use dropbox uploader to upload database backups created from automysqlbackup http://sourceforge.net/projects/automysqlbackup/ , but i'm currently only uploading using dropbox uploader, so i have a long list of legacy backups on dropbox which automysqlbackup deletes locally. i would like to also delete these backups from dropbox. i understand i could install the official dropbox package for linux, but it's frustrating that you have to remember to exclude any new directories you create on dropbox, hence my reason for using dropbox uploader. i've seen the example script that @paul-reed has mentioned a few times https://github.com/paul-reed/dropbox-archive/blob/master/lib/sync.sh l50-l68 , but i'm not great with shell scripts, so can't figure out how to list all files and directories recursively through dropbox uploader, check against the files and directories, and delete accordingly. an example of the structure that automysqlbackup creates, and that i currently upload to dropbox: - db - daily - database1 - database1_2017-03-01_06h25m.wednesday.sql.gz - database2 - database2_2017-03-01_06h25m.wednesday.sql.gz - monthly - database1 - database1_2017-03-01_06h25m.march.database1.sql.gz - database2 - database2_2017-03-01_06h25m.march.database2.sql.gz - weekly - database1 - database1_week.08.2017-02-25_06h25m.sql.gz - database2 - database2_week.08.2017-02-25_06h25m.sql.gz any help would be appreciated.
