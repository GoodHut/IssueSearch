 URL : "https://github.com/coturn/coturn/issues/171" TITLE : fedora official package BODY : hello everyone, i'd like to get coturn into fedora proper. i saw it's also the first issue in the todo file although that was last updated 2yrs ago, so not sure how important this is for you . i have forked rpm/turnserver.spec to https://github.com/lorbuschris/coturn-rpm and made a few rather little changes. builds in copr live here: https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/lorbus/turnserver/monitor/ i will begin the process of becoming a fedora packager and submit the spec for review by fedora qa next month, but i wanted to offer all of you devs the opportunity to review the spec beforehand. i will happily upstream any changes made to the spec to this repo, however eventually the spec will live in the fedora repos ie. src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/coturn or src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/turnserver i have one remaining question that will also need answering by fedora qa, but i'd like to hear your opinion nevertheless : would you prefer the package name be coturn or turnserver? cheers, chris
