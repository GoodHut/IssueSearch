 URL : "https://github.com/dwyl/hq/issues/400" TITLE : christmas party / meal BODY : i really enjoyed the march dinner 213 and think it would be a good idea to have another get together / meal at christmas 🎄 ☃️ my suggestion would be a meal at focushub on an weeknight evening in the first half of december 2017. we can either pick out an arbitrary date or run a doodle poll if people's availability is already looking patchy. my first arbitrary date suggestions are weds 6th or fri 8th dec. this is just an idea so feel free to chime in with suggestions of food or games or other!
