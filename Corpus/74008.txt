 URL : "https://github.com/Expensify/Bedrock/issues/314" TITLE : docs need navigation bar BODY : typically there is some sort of hierarchy or navigation bar on a docs website. for example bootstrap https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/theming/ has a navbar on the left hand side to see the different sections of the docs. i think that bedrock should have something similar. for example, i finally found vs_mysql http://bedrockdb.com/vs_mysql.html but it doesn't have any navigation to know where i am or where to go next.
