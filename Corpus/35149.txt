 URL : "https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate/issues/802" TITLE : deleting a selection BODY : do you want to request a feature or report a bug ? bug what's the current behavior? after selecting text with the cursor, backspace will only delete the selection sometimes. once it fails once, it appears to fail consistently. see the following gif which shows how the third selection does not get deleted correctly. ! image http://g.recordit.co/kdyme09iij.gif what's the expected behavior? the selected text should be deleted. this happens for me on http://slatejs.org/ /rich-text in chrome, firefox and safari on my mac. i have a similar problem on draftjs.org, and so this might be related to this draftjs issue https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/issues/1185 .
