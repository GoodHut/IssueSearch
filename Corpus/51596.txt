 URL : "https://github.com/NoImageAvailable/CombatExtended/issues/120" TITLE : auto-equip ammo broken BODY : auto-equip ammo option is currently broken. jobgiver_takeandequip returns an invalid cast error and reportedly ammo and melee weapons aren't being picked up. should probably give that whole code section a pass to make sure everything is working correctly with the new changes.
