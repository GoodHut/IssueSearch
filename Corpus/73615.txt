 URL : "https://github.com/ccd0/4chan-x/issues/1611" TITLE : custom css can't be used BODY : hey, first of all thanks for keeping this extension up to date for such a long time. secondly, there seems to be bug with the custom style-sheet in the advanced settings. i had a pretty nice script for my personal 4chan style, but it's gone now perhaps because of the firefox 57 update? . and the box where i would input that custom css is greyed out, so i can't write a new style even if i wanted to. i hope you find a way to fix this soon ðŸ˜„
