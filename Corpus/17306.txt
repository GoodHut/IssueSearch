 URL : "https://github.com/Jire/Charlatano/issues/341" TITLE : only rcs working. BODY : so i got this problem when i join the game i got my gun in hands and all, i start the charlatano and get the empty cmd prompt but still nothing works except rcs, tried reinstalling java a few times, rebuilding and seems like nothing helped. btw i am trying to use 1.0.5 hotfix version since i can't find 1.0.6 here, maybe that's the problem.
