 URL : "https://github.com/yagop/node-telegram-bot-api/issues/258" TITLE : support for pwrtelegram BODY : it's such a cool api that works exactly with the same syntax etc than the official one does, but it has a lot of cool features, such as resolving of usernames not only with channels and groups but also with normal users and bots . there could be an option to use it as the base api url, something like: javascript const bot = new telegrambot token, { polling: true , usepwr: true } ;
