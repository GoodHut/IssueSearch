 URL : "https://github.com/grimfang4/sdl-gpu/issues/73" TITLE : masking via gpu_image? BODY : in ios i can set a mask just an 8bit alpha texture on a calayer and then render that layer as a solid rect containing either a texture or colour and only the high-alpha regions of the mask will be rendered by the gpu onto the frame buffer. from what i understand this work would normally be done by a fragment shader. is there an easier way in sdl_gpu?
