 URL : "https://github.com/vuejs/vue-test-utils/issues/42" TITLE : not working in browser BODY : wanted to use this in browser testing using mocha, chai, sinon, expect... but it seems like this is only meant to be used in node or at least after building it. i did that using browserify, but it is throwing this error: vm1397:27 vue warn : you are using the runtime-only build of vue where the template compiler is not available. either pre-compile the templates into render functions, or use the compiler-included build. this implies that i have to change it's source for it work properly for my case, which is something i think shouldn't happen. i thought maybe i am missing something or maybe that scenario wasn't thought through enough. is there a clear proper way of using these utilities in the browser without any complicated setup processes. simply getting the script using the script tag and start using it right away.
