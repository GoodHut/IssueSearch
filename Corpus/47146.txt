 URL : "https://github.com/tendrilinc/marathon-autoscaler/issues/39" TITLE : not working with dcos BODY : hi, i am trying out the autoscaler on dcos. the autoscaler is up and running and can fetch data from mesos and marathon as expected. however, it is not scaling the applications. i tried to add logs around the autoscaler to see what might be wrong. apparently the application-definition always turns out to be empty {} so the is_app_participating function is always passed an empty dict app_def = applicationdefinition metrics_summary.get application_ returns null my application's marathon json condensed is as follows: { id : /spark3 , backofffactor : 1.15, backoffseconds : 1, container : { type : docker , volumes : , docker : { image : mesosphere/spark:2.0.1-2.2.0-1-hadoop-2.6 , forcepullimage : true, privileged : false, parameters : { key : user , value : root } } }, cpus : 1, disk : 0, instances : 1, labels : { mas_rule_fastscaleup : cpu | >50 | pt1m | 2 | pt1m30s , min_instances : 1 , max_instances : 10 , use_marathon_autoscaler : yes } } is it something wrong here? can you please point me in the right direction? thanks for the help.
