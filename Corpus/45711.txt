 URL : "https://github.com/libuv/libuv/issues/1379" TITLE : info license for logo BODY : i'm the maintainer of uvw . i'd like to create a simple logo for the project and add it to the readme . the idea was to create it out of the one of libuv . because of that i want to know exactly what license is applied to the logo, the mit one or the cc by 4.0 license? in other terms, can i freely use the unicorn velociraptor for that? if yes, have you any preference regarding the logo? note that my sole purpose is to recall to the mind that libuv is the engine that runs under the hood. if you prefer not to have your logo used in another project, there are no problems. i can do it differently. i'm looking forward to having a feedback from you. thank you in any case.
