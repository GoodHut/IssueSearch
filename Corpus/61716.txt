 URL : "https://github.com/albfan/miraclecast/issues/233" TITLE : black screen with rpi 3 BODY : hello, we, i and my colleagues, want to use miraclecast with 2 raspberry pi 3, one as sink and the other as peer source . but first, we wanted to use miraclecast with a rpi raspbian as a sink and my phone, samsung galaxy s4 mini android 4.4.2, and use the screen mirroring tool of the phone. unfortunately, we didn't manage to make it work. there is a connection between the two devices but the output stream is a black screen. here is the log. miraclecastlog.tar.gz https://github.com/albfan/miraclecast/files/1318004/miraclecastlog.tar.gz do you have any idea ? we tried the same implementation but with your archarm image and we had the same issue. we also see that using miraclecast as source and for this we should see the wip implementation branch, did you or someone else already try with 2 rpi 3 ? thanks in advance.
