 URL : "https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud/issues/112" TITLE : max number of words BODY : my request is that a max number of words argument be made available. while for the simple case, there are alternatives from a built in max word feature, but consider when one is working with a large corpus of documents. instead of dynamically handing the word count object for each document, it would be best in my opinion to have a simple way to toggle max words to be displayed by cloud.js for example, long documents often have hundreds of words in the resulting word clouds. whereas short documents have much less. if one wanted a degree of consistency with regards to load time, aesthetics, ect, then having a max word feature would be extremely useful. thank you.
