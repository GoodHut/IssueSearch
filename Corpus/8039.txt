 URL : "https://github.com/emojicode/emojicode/issues/74" TITLE : maybe use llvm? BODY : llvm is a set of optimisers and a code generator for most of major architectures. making the emojicode compiler an llvm frontend would mean that the real time engine isn't necessary because native code would be generated. additionally, optimizations don't need to be implemented, instead a well tested implementation could be used. both of these features would improve performance of emojicode, but native code generation can apso widen the range of applications of the language, including making it possible to write emojicode in itself.
