 URL : "https://github.com/LegendGraphics/FastMassSpring/issues/3" TITLE : mass matrix and timestep BODY : thanks for writing this framework. my only issue with it is that i can't see how the mass matrix and timestep mentioned in the paper fit in. it appears that, in this implementation, the system matrix is just the weighted laplacian l instead of being m + h^2l , where m is the mass matrix and h is the fixed timestep. am i getting this wrong, or are these things that the person using the framework should implement?
