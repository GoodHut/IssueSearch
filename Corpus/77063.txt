 URL : "https://github.com/riscv/riscv-tests/issues/77" TITLE : missing stuff for init.c BODY : i've written a risc-v simulator, and i wanted to run the available stress tests. i started here with riscv-tests. i ran ./configure with the latest sifive sdk for macos the git master for risc-v gcc fails to build from source in my macos . it seemed to compile successfully. the repo readme doesn't have info on how to run the tests, so i started poking around and tried to make debug-check . that procedure involves compiling some c source files, including programs/init.c . that c source file includes init.h , which i can't find anywhere. can you please provide more information on how to find the required dependencies?
