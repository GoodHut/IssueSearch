 URL : "https://github.com/mvysny/gphoto2-java/issues/11" TITLE : binding to windows dll BODY : hi, first of all, i have successfully used gphoto2-java to make a gui for time-lapse capture working on linux platform. thank you! next, i wanted to make the same for windows. native dlls were built using msys2 mingw64 environment windows port - few questions 97 https://github.com/gphoto/libgphoto2/issues/97 . so, long story short, i could not use those dlls with gphoto2-java. i tried to account for all requirements: both jre and dll are 64 bit; all dependencies a number of dlls required by gphot2.dll are collected in one folder and jna.library.path set to this folder; jna.debug_load=true reports that the library is found in the path specified by jna.library.path. the error log: hs_err_pid1524.log https://github.com/mvysny/gphoto2-java/files/1550246/hs_err_pid1524.log additionally, i tried to import the library in c code. i have checked only gp_library_version function. no success. hresult: 0x8007007e dll not found exception , although all the dependencies are located in the folder with the exe. but, at the same time, i succeed when i use the library dynamically loaded in a simple c++ program with all conditions the same: all dependencies are placed in the folder with .exe. the .exe is built as 64 bit application to correspond to the 64-bit dlls. again, i have checked only gp_library_version function, and it returned the strings with the library info, as it should. so, the windows port of the library seem to work normally. it seems that both c and java can not use this windows port because of some problems with loading functions from dlls dependent by the library. what can be done?
