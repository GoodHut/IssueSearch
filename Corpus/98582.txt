 URL : "https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline/issues/246" TITLE : issues after first request BODY : i'm not sure if this is an issue with my code or serverless-offline. i am using graphql and mongoose. my first request to serverless-offline works but any hits after that returns 'overwritemodelerror: cannot overwrite store model once compiled.', the thing is, the fn works fine on lambda. i suspect serverless-offline is trying to reload some of the modules?? exports.graphqlhandler = event, context, cb => { mongoose.connect process.env.mongodb_uri, { server: { socketoptions: {connecttimeoutms: 10000} } } mongoose.connection.on 'error', => { cb new error 'error connecting to mongodb.' process.exit 1 } const cbclosedb = function error, output { mongoose.disconnect cb error, output } graphqlhandler event, context, cbclosedb } any ideas?
