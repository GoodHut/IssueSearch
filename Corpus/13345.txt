 URL : "https://github.com/reed-college/paneity/issues/106" TITLE : tutors chat back BODY : i can't believe i missed this, but while there is a way on the website for users to chat with tutors, there is no way for the tutors to know they are being messaged. the only way currently for tutors to chat back is to manually go to /dialogs/<student_username> .
