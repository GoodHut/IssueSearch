 URL : "https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfMQTT/issues/41" TITLE : automatic connect function BODY : can you add automatic connect function? thanks. for instance, when the broker restarts, ping/pong test cannot auto connect to the broker server. like as: recently, i learned about paho. mqtt. c, and found the function as: void connectionlost void context, char cause url: https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.c/blob/master/src/samples/paho_c_pub.c so, maybe the following function names are more appropriate: typedef void lmqtt_client_on_connect_lost void , lmqtt_connect_t , int ; disconnect: disconnect actively by itself connect_lost: passive disconnect.
