 URL : "https://github.com/chariotsolutions/phonegap-nfc/issues/267" TITLE : w3c web nfc api draft BODY : probably api should be rewritten to follow web nfc api draft http://w3c.github.io/nfc/proposals/common/nfc.html . currently i don't know of any browser implementing it but might make transition easier in long term. since it would be an breaking change it should land before 1.0 release.
