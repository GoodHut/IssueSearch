 URL : "https://github.com/openastroproject/openastro/issues/244" TITLE : data pipeline for speckle BODY : i'm interested in turning oa capture into a capture pipeline for doing speckle. short version, running on a jetson board, would like to intercept the images and send them to the gpu cuda for fourier transform and stacking, then save the resultant stacked fourier along with the raw file. would also like the raw file 1000 to 10000 images, though could be 256 x 256 bits or 512 x 512 saved in a fits cube. if you were going to make these chances, can you suggest a preferred place to intercept the image stream i.e. file and rough line number maybe, please ... i have oacapture loaded on the jetson and it seems to come up. i need to get a powered usb3 hub to connect the camera for testing... thank you...
