 URL : "https://github.com/glawrence/titles-extension/issues/9" TITLE : work with all tabs BODY : currently only the active tab is copied to the clipboard, which is an approach that fits with the user interface. however an option to copy all tabs to the clipboard would be very useful. some thoughts: - add a blank line after pinned tabs - consider how multiple windows are handled - disable title & url editing - disable relative path
