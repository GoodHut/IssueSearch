 URL : "https://github.com/flow/noise/issues/14" TITLE : why value range 0-1? BODY : why flow noise has value range 0-1? why not leave it as -1 to 1? this value range is very counterintuitive when using it for terrain generation, and annoying to work with, where the average value specifies average terrain height especially when used as 3d noise : scaling the noise generator output changes average value changing almost any parameters when using multiple octaves except frequency changes average value with value range 0-1, there is a very simple way to make 3d noise based terrain generator: multiply the noise output by desired height variation, add average height, and use the output as heightmap that also depends on height. the only situation i see where values 0 to 1 are simpler is when outputting to image, which is done only sometimes for testing.
