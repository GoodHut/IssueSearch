register int31 as int31 type in coq_int31 by true. yet register is not described in the 8.3 reference manual. @ aspiwack on 2010-10-19 23:17:01 +0200 well, yes, i do not plan on documenting in the near future as it is not ready for the user's use, and might be replaced before it is. on the other hand, what should be documented and does not seem to be, is that you can use the type int31 and the associated operation for processor-backed fixed-size integer arithmetic. for natural numbers still using the processor's arithmetic , the type bign is available, and for all integers, there is bigz. i'll keep this report open to remind me to provide documentation on these features. @ pirbo on 2011-04-06 16:41:35 +0200 yet a new reminder arnaud :- @ zimmi48 on 2017-06-09 17:30:36 +0200 i don't know if this should be re-assigned to maxime dénès or to pierre letouzey.
