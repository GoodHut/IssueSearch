 URL : "https://github.com/michael-brade/LaTeX.js/issues/5" TITLE : document ast format BODY : great tool! i would like the option to output into formats other than html, or maybe even into html with a different mapping from latex environments to html tags. any you could publish a summary of the ast format produced by the peg.js parser, so others like me can write associated transformers?
