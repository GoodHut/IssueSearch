 URL : "https://github.com/blacktop/docker-logstash-alpine/issues/5" TITLE : logstah confs volume BODY : why did you decided to put volumes for /etc/logstash/conf.d ? having problems with it now. we extended your image and have our own confs, on our dockerfile we have copy ./confs /etc/logstash/conf.d . now after rebuilding the image with changes to the logstash conf file, the changes do not take effect because the confs file were mounted and it persisting. any, workaround for this?
