 URL : "https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently/issues/108" TITLE : remake directory failed BODY : in package.json delsrc : if exist src rd src /s /q , makesrc : if not exist src mkdir .\\src , buildsrc : concurrently \ npm run delsrc\ \ npm run makesrc\ , this one of examples when the second script need to do a checkup, it generates a bug without displaying an error. in this case, if you run buildsrc the first time, that seems to be all right. but, if you run it a second time, the src folder is removed but not made again. it seems to be the check up if not exist which would be run before delsrc . is it a real bug ? there is an other way to do this ?
