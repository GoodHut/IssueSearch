 URL : "https://github.com/albertlauncher/albert/issues/328" TITLE : update index on the fly BODY : this is yet another feature suggestion. currently, one has to either wait or go to the settings and update the index manually. this is either time-consuming or cumbersome. i suggest having a searchable option to update index. for example, if one searches in albert for albert.update_index or any other name , one could click there and have the index updated, without having to go to the settings.
