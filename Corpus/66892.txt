 URL : "https://github.com/frmdstryr/enamlx/issues/7" TITLE : not python 3 compatible BODY : hi, thank you for your work, i think it will be a very useful package! unfortunately it doesn't work under python 3. i managed to get it to work at least some of the examples by fixing a few print statements to functions, and using basestring = str, bytes because basestring is no longer defined in python 3.
