 URL : "https://github.com/medienbaecker/kirby-images/issues/15" TITLE : bug when dragging image BODY : steps to reproduce: 1. drag an image to sort it with your field. make sure to hover the remove button when dragging it. 1. when dropping it it will be sorted correctly, but then the image will also be removed. while it is correct from a technical perspective it's not very user friendly, looking at the files in the panel the image is not removed even when dragging with the trash button.
