 URL : "https://github.com/sofa-framework/doc/issues/10" TITLE : document on mappings BODY : hi, i know that documenting sofa is a hard work that is always in progress. however, mappings are one of the tricky but most important features of the framework. when i was looking for precise info, i ended up on these pages that are currently empty https://www.sofa-framework.org/community/doc/main-principles/mapping-mechanism/ https://www.sofa-framework.org/community/doc/using-sofa/basic-components/mapping/ do you think it could be possible to obtain a documentation on the different types of mappings and some details regarding the parameters they offer when adding them to a scene transformation from global to local coordinates and other things ... thanks
