 URL : "https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/issues/1010" TITLE : help with exchangeerror BODY : hello, sometimes i get an exchangeerror that is retry'able because the exchange has problems. for example: ccxt.base.errors.exchangeerror: kucoin 404 ccxt.base.errors.exchangeerror: kucoin 502 <html> in other situations however, it's not retry'able because i just did something stupid. for example: ccxt.base.errors.exchangeerror: kucoin fetchopenorders requires a symbol param how can i differentiate between the two ? now i'm retry'ing all exchangeerrors, but in some cases this is not very useful. thanks!
