 URL : "https://github.com/Jazqa/kwin-quarter-tiling/issues/48" TITLE : ide causes problems BODY : hey, i only tried it with intellij, but i am pretty sure that the following problem is going to appear on many ides. when you start intellij you first have a small window, where you can pick, which project you want to start. the tiling script cant change the size of this window, but it positions it in the correct tile. now when you choose a project, the small window closes and the actual ide starts. so there are a couple of split seconds, in which you dont have any window open. when you want to have intellij open on its workspace in full size, this will result in the following: you pick a project -> the small window closes -> the tiling script notices that you are on an empty workspace, so it moves you back on another workspace -> intellij opens on the new workspace instead of the one, where it was actually started so my question is, is there any way to disable the function, which automatically moves back to a non empty workspace?
