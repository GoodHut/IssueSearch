BODY : hi @sayden great example! i am trying to see learn how to best model field population using graphql. i see that for your user mongoose schema you have hobbies and friends both of which are objectids and reference hobby/friend types respectively. however in your graphql model, you don't seem to account for the possibility of the hobby and friend field taking on an objectid or hobbytype / usertype object. i want users to be able to receive a list of objectids or populated objects depending on their query params. how would you best do this?
