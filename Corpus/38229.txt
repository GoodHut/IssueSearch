 URL : "https://github.com/google/blockly-devtools/issues/7" TITLE : open project feature BODY : goal: make it so that you can save whole project on one button click - save block groups into separate .js files - save toolboxes into separate .xml files - focus on downloading web first and then work on android and ios once web is fully working note: priority in making the download function work with multiple files. placement of download button is arbitrary; will be moved to menu bar in future iterations.
