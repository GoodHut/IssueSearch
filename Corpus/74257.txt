 URL : "https://github.com/Well-FED/hear-me-out/issues/8" TITLE : embedded svg and <use /> BODY : similar to the way github does its octiconsâ€¦ it might work out great if we embed a parent svg in the html. this svg could contain each and every button icon as fragments. then, each button could refer to the parent svg fragment using the <use /> element. no more tardy pngs. hello optimised and flexible svgs!
