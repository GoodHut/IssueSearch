 URL : "https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/issues/5542" TITLE : bind popup to geojson top BODY : i'm not sure if this is in the documentation, but i'm unable to find it. i have some geojson and with that i create a layer that i add to the map and add a popup to it // create layer const layer = l.geojson geojson // create the popup const options = {} const popup = l.popup options .setcontent somecontent // bind popup layer.bindpopup popup .on 'mouseover', function {this.openpopup } .addto somemap this works fine but the popup appears in the center of the geojson. i'd like the popup to appear on the top of the layer. is it possible to set the popup to start at some coordinates? of course i can set some offset but it only works in pixels so if i zoom out it is no longer on the upper part of the geojson. is that possible? i haven't found it in the docs. i'm using leaflet 1.0.3
