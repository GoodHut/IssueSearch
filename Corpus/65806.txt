 URL : "https://github.com/jcupitt/php-vips/issues/32" TITLE : libvips info in phpinfo BODY : to check which version of libvips we're running and which loaders are currently enabled, it would be nice to have some more info about the current vips setup in phpinfo . for example this is what the gd extension on our server displays: ! gd-phpinfo https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12746591/22856432/8f32d3dc-f091-11e6-8464-9ba588511a94.png _ extension source can be found here https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/php-7.1.1/ext/gd/gd.c l1200 _ for the vips extension we could do something like this: ! vips-phpinfo https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12746591/22856454/dcd4fd72-f091-11e6-815c-716fb23cc987.png _ approximately the same as what you see if you build libvips. i think some info is unnecessary _
