 URL : "https://github.com/larskanis/fxruby/issues/36" TITLE : fxruby 1.6.35 regressions BODY : on windows x64 system. unfortunately what works om fxruby 1.6.34 fails in 1.6.35. this is in the area of popup screens. so i will need to update the dependencies of my application to limit it to 1.6.34. i guess we need a full test suite so that changes don't break stuff. i will try and create a test case.
