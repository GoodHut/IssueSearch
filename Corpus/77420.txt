 URL : "https://github.com/bigretromike/nakamori/issues/186" TITLE : need of build_tv_seasons BODY : we used to use seasons as builder for directories like episodes credits trailers . current api return them as episode with different type same as anidb does . we can stick with old way and make those in virtual directories and query for same url twice one when entering series and invoking season_build and one after entering directory like episodes or we can drop this in favor of icons in menu, or virtual directories inside serie its one less enter in directory for people that want to watch series also this way we could add hide options to hide extra things i would like to know your opinion on this one @da3dsoul as you are more into kodi-skin thing and will know if we can pull this of with icons/symbols or we better of the old way
