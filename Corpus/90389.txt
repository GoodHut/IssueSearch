 URL : "https://github.com/subfission/cas/issues/45" TITLE : set url logout as service BODY : i'm building a multisite laravel environment with cas. i need to use different logout_redirect for every site, but my cas server only allow service parameter as redirect. so when passing a url on logout is not working, because parameter is called url instead of service. can be possible to change or to add an additional parameter to logout function to use url as service? thanks.
