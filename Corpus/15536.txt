 URL : "https://github.com/SecPi/SecPi/issues/111" TITLE : error first start BODY : hello, i followed the wiki, used the git clone command to get the software on my raspberry pi but i'm stuck at the first start step at the wiki. according to the wiki i should have secpi-manager -worker and -webinterface installed in /etc/init.d/. i don't see them in that dir, however i do found them in /secpi/scripts/ but when i try to run them all 3 promt a message '-bash: secpi-manager: command not found' although i can see them with the 'ls' command and i can edit all 3 with the 'nano' command. anybody that knows where i'm wrong? i added a few screenshots, first one is snag of my /etc/init.d/ and the second one is a snag of my /secpi/scripts dir and error following to run the service. https://imgur.com/a/7jhga url
