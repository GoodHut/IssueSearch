 URL : "https://github.com/0mniscient/Discord-Themes/issues/38" TITLE : themes no longer working? BODY : whenever i try to load one of your themes specifically quiet , it is unsuccessful. it returns an error messaging about not being able to load the meta. is this going to be fixed, or is there a way i can fix it myself? or should i start looking for another theme? if there is any way to fix it, i would certainly prefer to do that because i absolutely love your themes! they are leagues above all of the other ones i've tried. :1st_place_medal: thanks in advance, and keep up the great work @0mniscient ! üëç
