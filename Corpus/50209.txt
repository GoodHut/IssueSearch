BODY : i did cd /mnt && ll , but i didn't find a c directory there, which i always found there. i always had it and could navigate inside my c drive and edit files but now mnt is empty. as a linux newbie, i can't explain it. was c moved/removed from mnt in the last update? it is extremely important for me to navigate to some locations inside c, especially as part of commands.
