 URL : "https://github.com/kalabox/kalabox/issues/1780" TITLE : mac drush performance BODY : i'm using kalabox 2.1.3, and it seems that kbox drush commands run a bit slow. for example, kbox drush status routinely takes more than 1 minute to return results. i'm on a macbook air, docker has 2 core + 2gb memory assigned to it the default values . embarrassingly, i had a colleague on a windows machine using kalabox do it in about 10 seconds... is there anything else i should look for regarding potential performance issues? any other settings? thanks, -mike
