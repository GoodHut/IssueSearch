 URL : "https://github.com/MaslowCNC/GroundControl/issues/361" TITLE : z-axis jumping list view BODY : the skipping to the next z-axis move is very useful, but clicking that button dozens of times to get to the entry you want is tedious. can there be a list view of the z-axis moves, and when the mouse or keyboard up/down brings the z-move list item in focus it highlights the location of the z-move in the working area, and then when the list item is selected jumps the g-code counter to the selected z-move. the goto button could be reused as a drop-down to give an option to go to a specific g-code line, or see the z-move list.
