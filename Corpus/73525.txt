 URL : "https://github.com/ppazos/cabolabs-ehrserver/issues/706" TITLE : create teams for queries BODY : right now queries can have just one author and be shared between orgs. the main editor is the author, and it is the one that should be doing all the edit and share. in an org there might be more people doing that, and those are not the author. so we need a team of editors for a query, those users can edit and share the queries they have access to.
