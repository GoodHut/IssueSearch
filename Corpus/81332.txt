 URL : "https://github.com/pogarek/PokemonGo-Bot/issues/9" TITLE : will this cause banning? BODY : the first pokestop spin & first pokemon capture will have the bonus after 00:00 everyday. just found that the bot seems not to activate the bonus receiving since i use android phone to login at 01:30 and still get the bonus. of course, the bot is running sometimes between 00:00 ~ 01:30 . just wondered if someone also notices this and will this cause banning ? thanks.
