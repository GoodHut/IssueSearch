 URL : "https://github.com/fkchang/opal-hot-reloader/issues/7" TITLE : does not reload css BODY : hi, i'm using opal-hot-reloader with the latest github release, opal version 0.10.3, rails 5.0.2. i can't get it to actually reload the css in the browser. the console says reloading css: app/assets/stylesheets/context_map.css but the new css does not show up in the browser, necessitating a page reload. views and components work, it's just the styling that doesn't.
