 URL : "https://github.com/agile4you/bottle-jwt/issues/14" TITLE : bottle-jwt isn't stateless BODY : first, thanks for putting bottle-jwt in the open! it really helped me. however, there is one thing which i think might be improved. > jwts are a great authentication mechanism. they give you a structured and stateless way to declare a user and what they can access. they can be cryptographically signed and encrypted to prevent tampering on the client side. from https://stormpath.com/blog/where-to-store-your-jwts-cookies-vs-html5-web-storage. in this plugin's code it is not the case. suppose i want to store my user info in some kind of persistent storage, then i implement a custom backend which saves the info to let's say mongodb. every time the plugin validates the token it calls: user = self.backend.get_user ... which calls the database. this isn't stateless, and further. it retrieves information which should already found in the token itself. imho user = self.backend.get_user ... should only be called in create_token and validate should only validate with jwt.decode
