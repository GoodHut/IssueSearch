 URL : "https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science/issues/4835" TITLE : art formula is out-of-date BODY : indicate troubleshooting steps taken - x ran brew update and retried your prior step? - x checked that a similar issue hasn't already been filed? bug reports / build errors: brief summary of issue: the current art formula https://github.com/homebrew/homebrew-science/blob/master/art.rb installs art-chocolatecherrycake-03-19-2015 http://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/resources/assets/docs/artsrcchocolatecherrycake031915macostgz.tgz , which is a few versions out-of-date. the newest version is art-mountrainier-2016-06-05 https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/resources/assets/docs/artsrcmountrainier20160605macostgz.tgz . it would be great if the formula could be updated. the complete command that you issued: brew install art gist with output of brew doctor : brew doctor is irrelevant here: the existing formula compiled and installed just fine. link output by brew gist-logs <formula> : again irrelevant: the existing formula compiled and installed just fine. output of brew config : again irrelevant: the existing formula compiled and installed just fine. formula requests: the quickest way to get a new formula into homebrew is to file a pull request https://github.com/homebrew/homebrew-science/pulls . we will consider your request but it may be closed if it's something we're not actively planning to work on.
