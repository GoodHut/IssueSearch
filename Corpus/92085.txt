 URL : "https://github.com/cytopia/devilbox/issues/90" TITLE : using symlinks for htdocs BODY : hi, i'm using devilbox on macos 10.10.5 + docker 17.06.0-ce for mac + docker-compose 1.14.0 while docker doc https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/osxfs/ namespaces states that /volumes/... is available in containers, when i run devilbox ./bash.sh i do not see /volumes nor /users /private . this prevent usage of symlinks under ./data/www/my-project ln -s /volume/repo/gitrepoofmycode/www htdocs once into php container this link is broken what i did to solve this issue: a in .env, i add host_path_httpd_symlink=/volumes/repo b in docker.compose.yml, i add those 2 lines: mount volumes related to ln -s htdocs - ${host_path_httpd_symlink}:${host_path_httpd_symlink}:rw under those two sections: httpd.volumes and php.volumes in addition to the ${host_path_httpd_datadir} usage it works now : i am not proud of this duplicate into docker.compose.yml and even worse having modified this file but it is the only easy way i found using ln -s for htdocs when project code is on a separate volume. maybe i should use docker.compose.yml volumes like suggested by https://www.baptiste-donaux.fr/tutoriel-symfony-docker-compose-v2/ but this is my very first docker usage... up to you to decide : note: i did try first setting host_path_httpd_datadir to /volume/repo/gitrepoofmycode instead of ./data/www but since /volumes is not mounted in the container, this does not help.
