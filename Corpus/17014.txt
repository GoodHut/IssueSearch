 URL : "https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/5830" TITLE : multi vo services BODY : following the documentation http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/vo/conesearch/client.html , i was trying to use the ~astropy.vo.client.vos_catalog.call_vo_service routine to make a conesearch on a list of services which are not present in the default cone search services list, namely a bunch of cds/vizier cone search services. using vos_catalog.voscatalog i created a custom database with 3 conesearch services, which i passed to vos_catalog.call_vo_service . however, only the first matching service result is returned, instead of the naively expected 3 results. it seems that this is a built-in feature of call_vo_service https://github.com/astropy/astropy/blob/master/astropy/vo/client/vos_catalog.py line 871 . i was wondering if this was a wanted feature or if i could wrap-up a small pr to return a dictionary or a list of ~astropy.table.table . similarly ~astroquery returns a custom ~astroquery.utils.commons.tablelist ordered list, but i wonder if the equivalent type exist or will exist in astropy.table .
