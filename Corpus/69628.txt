BODY : @vdauwera commented on sun jan 08 2017 https://github.com/broadinstitute/wdltool/issues/20 i had a few issues that were fixed by building the latest from source. there's a good chance that will also be the case for the other issues that have been reported. would be good to cut a release to make it available without requiring people to build from source. --- @knoblett commented on mon feb 20 2017 https://github.com/broadinstitute/wdltool/issues/20 issuecomment-281030248 are we responsible for building a new release now that we own this repo? or am i misremembering? --- @ruchim commented on mon feb 20 2017 https://github.com/broadinstitute/wdltool/issues/20 issuecomment-281054777 the wdltool release is a part of the cromwell release process --- @knoblett commented on mon feb 20 2017 https://github.com/broadinstitute/wdltool/issues/20 issuecomment-281096658 ah, thank you, that makes sense. @vdauwera do we still need a release? the most recent release was done 3 days prior to the creation of this ticket. --- @vdauwera commented on mon feb 20 2017 https://github.com/broadinstitute/wdltool/issues/20 issuecomment-281097178 does the release process include making a packaged jar? i think my problem was that there wasn't a jar that corresponded to the latest releases version available for download, come to think of it.
