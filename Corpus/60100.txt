 URL : "https://github.com/kokkos/ISO-CPP-Papers/issues/21" TITLE : what is n5131 3.9.1p8? BODY : p0019, p0020 and p0440 all refer to a document n5131, in some cases to paragraph 3.9.1p8. i tried to search for this and was unable to find. in the iso c++ papers, the closest so far is n4701. my best guess is that you refer to floating-point types definition in 6.9.1 basic.fundamental p8 of the c++ standard.
