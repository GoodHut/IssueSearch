 URL : "https://github.com/sivaramsi/manageyum/issues/16" TITLE : google allo web support BODY : the newly arrived allo web client at https://allo.google.com/web doesn't work on manageyum. i think mostly because it only works on chrome by now. support for other browsers will come later. current chrome's user agent on macos: mozilla/5.0 macintosh; intel mac os x 10_12_6 applewebkit/537.36 khtml, like gecko chrome/60.0.3112.101 safari/537.36 current manageyum's user agent: mozilla/5.0 macintosh; intel mac os x 10_12_6 applewebkit/537.36 khtml, like gecko manageyum/2.0.1 chrome/56.0.2924.87 electron/1.6.8 safari/537.36 don't know if manageyum can spoof chrome's user agent.
