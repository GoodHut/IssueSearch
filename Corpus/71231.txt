 URL : "https://github.com/gluon-lang/gluon/issues/333" TITLE : add a json de serializer BODY : probably needs to be done with a macro which takes a type as an argument which could then be used to leverage serde for serialization. f type mytype = { x : int, name : option string } let deserializer : string -> result jsonerror mytype = json_deserializer! mytype deserializer ... alternatively we could look at how elm's json parser works http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/json-decode though i have hear that it can be difficult to use.
