 URL : "https://github.com/pg-irc/pathways-backend/issues/130" TITLE : pathways demo ux BODY : there needs to be some pathways element to the demo scheduled for january. given the time constraints and lack of user-tested mocks at this point in time, we will not have a functioning pathways functionality by then. however, we plan to have user tested mocks in place in time for a basic pathways ux to be built, purely for demonstration purposes. this will be done with hard-coded data in the client, i.e. there will be no server side piece to this. however, it will not be throw-away code, as we will integrate this ux with the necessary services subsequently to the demo.
