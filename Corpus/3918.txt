 URL : "https://github.com/bauhausjs/phantom-html2pdf/issues/40" TITLE : 3.1.0 vs 4.0.0 BODY : it looks like this repo shows package.json as 3.1.0, but the most recent version on npm is 4.0.0. is there a reason for this, or was pushing v4 accidental? i'd like to stay up-to-date with the most recent version on npm, but i'm confused at the version mismatch. thanks for your work maintaining this product!
