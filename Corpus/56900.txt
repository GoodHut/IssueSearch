 URL : "https://github.com/restrictcontentpro/rcp-site-child/issues/62" TITLE : outdated refund policy BODY : the refund policy link is outdated. the latest one is here: http://docs.restrictcontentpro.com/article/1706-refund-policy instead of loading the refund policy in a modal and having to keep 2 copies updated, i propose we link directly to the above policy on the doc site.
