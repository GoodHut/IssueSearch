BODY : i have no idea why it´s not working. i open the application check that my wallet is selected. as soon i enter the password everything disappears i just get a tiny grey bitcoin cash symbol in next to the clock in taskbar, when i hover my mouse over it it vanishes and then application seem´s closed. i even tried to make a new default_wallet and enter my seed, but the next button remain´s non clickable. and i still have the old 2.9.3 exe also on my pc which opens just fine. but i was not able to sent any transaction´s only receiving was possible. : thank you
