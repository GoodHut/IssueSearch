 URL : "https://github.com/adfinis-sygroup/vault-client/issues/47" TITLE : secret wide comments BODY : currently comments are limited to k/v pairs: url: https://someloginurl.tld user1: value user0: value that show up like this, because the output is alphabetically sorted by the key: user@host:~$ vc show test user0: value url: https://someloginurl.tld user1: value <br/><br/> sometimes it would be useful to have secret wide comments like this: url: https://someloginurl.tld user1: value user0: value respectively: user@host:~$ vc show test url: https://someloginurl.tld user0: value user1: value maybe we could occupy the comment key in a secret for this? @czosel @keachi what do you think?
