 URL : "https://github.com/thiezn/iperf3-python/issues/22" TITLE : client hangs while running BODY : i'm using python 2.7.12, iperf 3.0.11 on a ubuntu 16.04.1 x86_64 machine. i configured the client to run as follows: >>> import iperf3 >>> client = iperf3.client >>> client.duration = 125 >>> client.bind_address = '127.0.0.1' >>> client.server_hostname = '127.0.0.1' >>> client.port = 9923 >>> client.bandwidth = 5096 1024 >>> client.num_streams = 3 >>> client.protocol = tcp >>> client.bulksize = client.bandwidth client.duration /8 >>> client.run the bandwidth parameter is configured that way since i need 5096 kbps. the bulksize parameter is kept as it is to ensure that the total throughput total bits sent/total duration matches the bandwidth value of 5096 1024 . i've run the same code with smaller throughput and smaller duration values and it works great. there are two problems: 1 when running this client, the client stalls. it does not terminate on my machine. for lower throughput/duration values, it works like a charm. whats the problem here? i always have to kill it for this specific test! 2 i've noticed that the traffic is bursty in nature i.e. it attempts to send most of the data within the 1st second itself rather than evenly distributing the data over the entire test duration. is there a way where i can achieve my expected throughput but have evenly distributed traffic as well?
