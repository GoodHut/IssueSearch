 URL : "https://github.com/CyberShadow/DFeed/issues/89" TITLE : dfeed as nntp server BODY : currently dfeed requires an nntp server as backend but duplicates it's message database. it would be far more efficient make dfeed an independent nntp server and host content rather than duplicating it. this would save a lot of disk-space and probably make using nntp clients faster, assuming that dfeed:s database is faster. another solution of course would be to have an external nntp server but with a shared database which probably could be done by modifying an existing nntp server to use a database that is acceptable to dfeed.
