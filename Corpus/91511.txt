 URL : "https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/8112" TITLE : trouble using private api BODY : description i'm trying to verify why semantic release is failing, after a long debugging, i can see travis is returning { file : not found } response for my requests. steps i used - i tried to get travis's auth token using github token like this: http post /auth/github http/1.1 host: api.travis-ci.com accept: application/json content-type: application/json cache-control: no-cache { github_token : <valid github token> } which returned me with a body similar to: json { access_token : <some access_token> } - now i tried to get the build information like this: http get /repos/<organization>/<valid repo>/builds/<build id> http/1.1 host: api.travis-ci.com authorization: token cflg7hwct_j6yopnusvy4a accept: application/vnd.travis-ci.2+json cache-control: no-cache which returns: json { file : not found } expected to see some kind of info. actual 404 not found i believe this is some kind of permission issue with private api, can someone verify that api.travis-ci.com is working fine? if i change from .com domain to .org domain and point to some of our opensource project, it works fine. i've redacted some sensitive info from issue for obvious reason.
