 URL : "https://github.com/singularityhub/sregistry/issues/37" TITLE : not able to make it work BODY : hi, after installing the web server and authenticate with social auth, now i want to try to push/pull images using sregistry. i build singularity-python locally as explained in the singularity file. now i've access to sregistry . how can i use it properly? first, i get the no secrets file exists error. i create a .sregistry at $home with name and secret_key keys. i'm not sure if this is ok, i don't read anywhere how to build this file. but then when trying to call to sregistry push command i get: typeerror: inspect got an unexpected keyword argument 'deffile' i'm completely lost. thanks, v√≠ctor
