 URL : "https://github.com/ELVIS-Project/elvis-database/issues/235" TITLE : unique account emails. BODY : it's possible to have multiple accounts with the same email. this is weird and not consistent with how most websites work. also causes a nasty issue where if you send a password reset email to an email that has multiple accounts associated with it, django will send all the emails in a burst, likely resulting in an error from the smtp server that sees us sending out n emails in a second.
