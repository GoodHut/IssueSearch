 URL : "https://github.com/ComputerScienceHouse/CSHPublicSite/issues/168" TITLE : add faq page to about BODY : we're facing more and more public criticism / skepticism about the processes and activities that we go through during the introductory process for incoming freshman students. to combat this, i propose that we become much more transparent about every step of the process, and break down what differentiates us from stereotypical fraternal organizations. with this, i'm hoping that we can better inform incoming students and parents about what exactly csh is and what the process looks like for applying. initial topic ideas: - is csh a frat? - what is the introductory process like? - what is freshman project? - what happens if iâ€™m not accepted? please comment with thoughts / concerns - i'm going to leave this open for a couple weeks so we can have discussion.
