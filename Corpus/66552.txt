 URL : "https://github.com/mumax/3/issues/100" TITLE : mumax leaks host memory BODY : i have recently observed that our compute nodes going out-of-memory. it turns out mumax leaks some host memory with 0.5-1 mb/s rate as could be seen from res reported by top . i can track the leak down to v3.9.1, but cannot really go further because of the major tool chain incompatibilities. it seems like leak is not related to neither go or cuda versions tried go1.6/1.7/1.8 and cuda7.5/8 . also tried to profile with pprof, but cannot see anything suspicions see the cpu and mem reports attached . moreover mumax3 still leaks with gogc=1. so the issue appears to be on the cgo side... mumax.pprof.reports.zip https://github.com/mumax/3/files/841434/mumax.pprof.reports.zip
