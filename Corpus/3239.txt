 URL : "https://github.com/petnica-meteor-group/meteor-flux/issues/6" TITLE : more data set BODY : in the current version of meteorflux, i can plot only one data set per graph. that is, i can select a number of years and i can decide whether the years shall be plotted individually or if they shall be averaged. in the new version i would like to be able to select two or more data sets for one graph. all data sets should share the begin and end time i.e. the same solar longitude interval the zenith exponent gamma the minimum radiant altitude y-max i.e. the maximum value of the y-axis for each data set, i would like to define individually the shower e.g. i would like to compare the activity of two showers the years e.g. i would like to compare the activity profiles of two years whether or not the data set are averaged e.g. i want to average the data from 2011-2015 but plot 2016 and 2017 individually the binning parameters minimum meteor count, minimum collection area , and min/max bin duration e.g. when more years are combined i can merge more meteors into a single bin the population index different showers will have different population indices - the default should be taken from the shower list in the end, all plots should be printed with different colors in the same graph. if the same shower is selected, the legend may only show the years s . if different showers are compared, the legend should shower the year s and the shower. note that the label of the right y-axis containes the r-value. so if different showers with different r-values are displayed, you also need to adapt the label.
