 URL : "https://github.com/esheldon/fitsio/issues/126" TITLE : write_key argument names BODY : is there a reason that the first argument to write_key is called keyname instead of name ? the readme suggests that you can pass the same arguments to write_key as used to create a fitshdr or write with the header= option. i don't think this will work if your dictionary consists of name , value and comment fields as suggested by these other methods.
