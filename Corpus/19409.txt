 URL : "https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-extras/issues/1" TITLE : add a tween method BODY : i want to be able to do this: js component.tween 'foo', 42, { duration: 800, easing: eases.cubicout } .then => { console.log 'tada' ; } ; starting a tween should stop any existing tweens on the same key. i suspect setting a key should have the same effect, and probably the only way to do that is to monkey-patch the component when the tween method is first called.
