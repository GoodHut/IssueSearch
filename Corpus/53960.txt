 URL : "https://github.com/Audentio/xfaddon-issues/issues/34" TITLE : fake users enhancement BODY : from tkt 7556 ok< i found that if i make a new primary usergroup and mirror the permission settings that i can get this to work properly. it is just an extra step that seems backwards i guess. any way i can change or ask for how to change the permission settings for this addon to reflect include any account in this secondary usergroup, as opposed to how it is only for the primary usergroup? unless i am missing the obvious? it is just easier to check the secondary usergroup choice in a member account as opposed changing the primary usergroup to the account you want in the pool.
