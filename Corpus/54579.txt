BODY : - cloud tools for eclipse version: 1.2.0.201706082053 - os: windows 10 10.0 - java version: 1.8.0_101 hello. i would like to import a javascript project from google sheets into eclipse but the only options i see are for java. from what i can tell this was possible with the google plugin for eclipse but that is being deprecated. is there going to be similar functionality in google cloud tools for eclipse or am i missing something? thanks
