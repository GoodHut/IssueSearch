 URL : "https://github.com/opencog/atomspace/issues/1374" TITLE : too low outgoing arity? BODY : outgoing arity is a 16-bit https://github.com/opencog/atomspace/blob/master/opencog/atoms/base/atom.h l86 meaning that if say my pattern matcher query has more than 65k answers, this call https://github.com/opencog/atomspace/blob/master/opencog/atoms/base/link.h l137 will silently get it wrong. there doesn't seem to be any max-arity check at construction either https://github.com/opencog/atomspace/blob/master/opencog/atoms/base/link.cc l58 i know we want to avoid having links with very large outgoing sets, but if permissible it shouldn't break the system.
