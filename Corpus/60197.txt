 URL : "https://github.com/NetherTechnology/BedWars/issues/10" TITLE : worst plugin out there BODY : this is the most poorly written plugin i've ever seen, they probably never test the plugin, it doesn't work, so many syntax errors. go get a job at mcdonalds or something have you ever tested your own crap? it's terrible. you are probably a 9 year old trying to code. ---
