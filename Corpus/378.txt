 URL : "https://github.com/fabiofurini/QPLIB/issues/1" TITLE : mi qp BODY : the 2nd paragraph of section 1.1 speaks about mi qp while before, e.g., in the abstract, qp was introduced as the family of continuous and mixed -integer optimization problems . so why there is now an extra mi added? while i still find it unusual to use qp for what is usually a miqcqp, i think one should then stick with the notion of qp and now silently introduce miqps in the middle of the introduction. i had this question as todo in the code, but that got removed without comment by af6f3f9f7. so i try it with an issue now.
