 URL : "https://github.com/keybase/client/issues/5685" TITLE : unable to access folders BODY : i have a private shared folder with another user. using the windows gui i went to folders->private and then clicked on the shared folder. it then showed me buttons labeled open folder and ignore folder. open folder does not seem to do anything. the same goes for my personal private and public folders. when i go to the windows file explorer i see the k drive under my computer but when i double click on it a message pops up stating that the location is not available. my log id: 3f0ae0ed720aa8c1ad622d1c
