 URL : "https://github.com/andrewvy/chrome-launcher/issues/9" TITLE : increasing poll interval BODY : i've seen intermittent failures to detect that chrome has launched. in almost all cases i suspect chrome did launch but not fast enough. the current code appears to have a max timeout of 300ms 10 tries at 30ms each on master looking at the chrome launcher by google they are also using 10 tries but the delay is 500ms each: https://github.com/googlechrome/chrome-launcher/blob/master/chrome-launcher.ts l119 so the total wait could be up to 5 seconds. i've tried this size timeout locally and it does appear to clear up any issues i've seen with detecting the process starting.
