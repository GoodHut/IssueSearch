 URL : "https://github.com/substance/texture/issues/145" TITLE : api for deletion BODY : i wonder what api we should use for element deletion. e.g. to remove an affiliation or an author. since we have an id for everything we could do something like doc.delete 'aff-2' or affnode.delete and automagically remove that entry from aff-group.childnodes. if we want to be more explicit and follow the dom api we would rather do: js affgroup.removechild affnode or we do it similar to jquery but with an explicit delete call that takes a selector. js doc.delete 'aff id=aff-1 ' thoughts?
