 URL : "https://github.com/gregsexton/gitv/issues/128" TITLE : line number continuity BODY : when using :gitv! and browsing committed versions of a file, gitv jumps back to the start of the file each time i hit enter on a commit message. it would be great, and i imagine more of a general use case, to stay at the same line in the file or even the same point in the diff between the two commits.
