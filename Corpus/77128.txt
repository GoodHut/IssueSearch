 URL : "https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/Nexus-Mod-Manager/issues/63" TITLE : mods tabs too much space BODY : the name/category/install date/etc use up 3 full screens of space. each tab has about 1/2 a screen of space. dragging tabs to shrink them only gives the space to the next tab. so there's always 3 screens of tabs and reducing the tabs to 1 page just makes the last tab 2 screens long. it also always resizes so the mod with the longest name will fit in the name tab. ! bug2 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10265840/24765196/1ca91c84-1ab4-11e7-881f-93043a2dd859.jpg
