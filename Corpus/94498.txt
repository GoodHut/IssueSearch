 URL : "https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan/issues/1143" TITLE : cannot scan known wp sites BODY : running 2.9.3 on kali wpscan --url www.domain.com --random-agent returns the wordpress url supplied 'http://www.domain.com/' seems to be down. maybe the site is blocking wpscan so you can try the --random-agent parameter. i've tried it on several known wordpress sites that i own/manage and it's the same each time. i can curl the sites with the same url and i notice that www.wp-scans.com works on the sites. not sure how to troubleshoot this?
