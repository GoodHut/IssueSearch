 URL : "https://github.com/tobie/specref/issues/344" TITLE : html pointing to multipage BODY : at some point, html started pointing to multipage : https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage this breaks all specs that were using fragment identifiers pointing back to html : it also makes it really annoying, because now one needs to know in which page each concept or interface is defined and makes referencing awkward and unique for this one spec - no other spec relies on multipage! . could we have a reference back to, please: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/ or, make a reference entry for each page: html-common-infrastructure @annevk
