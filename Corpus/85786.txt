 URL : "https://github.com/ros-drivers/pointgrey_camera_driver/issues/101" TITLE : flea3 outputs green image BODY : on two recently purchased usb3 flea3 cameras, the image produced when using the default camera.launch file is always green-tinted. no matter what the start-up conditions low light, high light, etc the image starts and remains green. we discovered that adding a parameter for auto_white_balance = false to the launch file seems to correct this behaviour. this never used to be necessary, so something must have changed in the hardware or driver. i don't mind adding this param into the launch file, but it's preferable if the issue were corrected at the root.
