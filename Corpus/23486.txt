 URL : "https://github.com/GameAnalytics/GA-SDK-CPP/issues/35" TITLE : possible linux bug BODY : has this been tested on linux? i've consistently hit the following error: gameanalytics-project-prefix/src/gameanalytics-project/source/dependencies/openssl/1.0.2h/libs/linux_x64/libcrypto.a e_rc4_hmac_md5.o : in function rc4_hmac_md5_cipher': e_rc4_hmac_md5.c: .text+0x407 : undefined reference to rc4_md5_enc' e_rc4_hmac_md5.c: .text+0x4ed : undefined reference to rc4_md5_enc' this seems to be an issue with the compiled openssl that is present in the repository. this is the only undefined reference i.e.: i didn't forget to link something . using kernel 4.10.13-200 64-bits with cmake and gcc on my own project. this happens with both gnu make and ninja. if you need more information just ask, but that is the only part of the build output that isn't a success. it happens during the linking phase somewhat obvious .
