 URL : "https://github.com/apiaryio/api-blueprint/issues/375" TITLE : dynamic query parameters BODY : as far as i know, there are some rare cases where it is indispensable to use query parameters witch field and value are both dynamic. for example it would be much simpler to _filter by multiple attributes_ with query parameters than width a complex url hierarchy and multiple requests. get /cars?brand=mercedes&color=red unfortunately i haven't found a way to do this with api blueprint properly yet. there is neither anything in the documentation about this nor have i found a question concerning this. all of the following ways are invalid: filters /cars{?field=variable} + parameters + field: brand optional, string + variable: mercedes optional, string filters /cars{?field}={variable} + parameters + field: brand optional, string + variable: mercedes optional, string as far as i can see it is not even allowed to have multiple examples for a parameter. the only valid method yet is to list all possible fields as separated parameters. imho this isn't handy to write nor is it easy to understand for users. any ideas?
