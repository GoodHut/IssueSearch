 URL : "https://github.com/asciidoctor/atom-asciidoc-preview/issues/239" TITLE : docinfo not supported BODY : description i found no mention for docinfo files http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/ docinfo-file in the repository, and in the light of this, as expected, using docinfo file doesn't work in preview: i successfully created a docinfo file, named docinfo.html in the same location of my-doc.adoc document. in that docinfo.html i put: <style> .gui { background-color : efefef; } </style> i added :docinfo: shared in my-doc.adoc as required http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/ naming-docinfo-files . and after executing asciidoctor my-doc.adoc , any text marked with gui gui text was correctly emitted with the gui class, displaying the right background color. however using this atom-asciidoc-preview extension in atom, i noticed that the preview doesn't display the right background color - it doesn't heed docinfo.html whatsoever. - atom version: 1.16.0 x64 - os: win10 x64 - asciidoc-preview version: 2.10.0 - language-asciidoc version: 1.10.0
