 URL : "https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/picongpu/issues/2057" TITLE : boost::math in pmacc BODY : why is boost::math used in cmake of libpmacc https://github.com/computationalradiationphysics/picongpu/blob/5c0b3204f19edd39f6830c373384a43689d762ab/src/libpmacc/pmaccconfig.cmake l268 ? i tried to check the includes because of the probable need to boost::serialization and could not find it, but maybe i missed it.
