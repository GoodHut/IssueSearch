 URL : "https://github.com/ASKBOT/askbot-devel/issues/707" TITLE : translated urls bug BODY : seo wise translating urls this is generally a bad idea, but especially translating the url /about to /&uuml;ber german version but referencing it in the menu with /Ã¼ber footer manu ist just not working. found the askbot_translate_url setting to get rid of that bug for my site, but this should be fixed.
