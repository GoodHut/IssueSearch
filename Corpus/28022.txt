 URL : "https://github.com/marmelroy/Zip/issues/72" TITLE : execute bit is lost BODY : just stumbled on this as the only swift cocoapod that works with my application. my only issue is that it strips the execute bits when it unzips. i have a zip with a .app inside. after unzipping, i get something like this guy does: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/181026/lsopenurlswithrole-failed-with-error-10810-cant-open-install-os-x-yosemite when i mark everything as executable, the .app works again. that's not a very clean solution. i'm wondering if i missed something. below is my usage: swift try zip.unzipfile location, destination: applicationsdirectory, overwrite: true, password: nil, progress: { progress -> in print progress dispatchqueue.main.async { self.downloadprogressbar.doublevalue = progress 0.2 + 0.8; } } // unzip any help is much appreciated.
