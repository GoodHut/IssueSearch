BODY : now we have an org to incubate projects that not part of the core implementation of the protocol or discussion of the spec. that org is ipfs-shipyard https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard created from https://github.com/ipfs/pm/issues/448 short description: > ipfs shipyard is a venue for the community to pursue and collaborate on research experiments, products, code libraries and more around the ipfs project. it is where innovation in userland happens and where we discover and form new primitives to push to the core of ipfs. sounds good?
