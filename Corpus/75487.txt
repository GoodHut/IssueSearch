 URL : "https://github.com/schickling/gulp-webserver/issues/123" TITLE : honor gulp --silent mode BODY : this is a fantasic ‘lil plugin. i've only got one minor! bone to pick– the plugin logs persist even when i've run my task in silent mode both by passing the --silent flag at the command line level, or by setting it in my .gulprc file the plugin. read through the docs as well as some issues, but i didn't see anything about it... so in short: i'm wondering if there's an easy way to silence _all_ logs from this plugin? thanks in advance!
