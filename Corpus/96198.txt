 URL : "https://github.com/xJon/The-1.7.10-Pack/issues/1385" TITLE : ender pearl + witchery bug BODY : ender pearl is currently not being accepted by cauldron, reason unknown. hoping this is a fixable bug - i can throw just about any other item at the cauldron and it will be accepted but the ender pearl just sits on top when thrown at it.
