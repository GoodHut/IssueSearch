 URL : "https://github.com/timgit/pg-boss/issues/21" TITLE : how to report failure BODY : if a job callback fails asynchronously, done doesn't appear to take an argument in typical node style. i read through 3 and my question is the same as op's first: > 1 how does a job consumer report failure, such as to requeue the job for another attempt later? i'm not necessarily looking to retry the failed job, but i'd like to tell boss that the job failed as soon as it does fail, rather than waiting for the timeout. is this possible? if not, would you be open to a pr accepting an error argument to the done call? i would think this would be non-breaking.
