 URL : "https://github.com/jpcsupplies/Economy_mod/issues/160" TITLE : enh vote functionality BODY : server admins may want to periodically quiz their players on a range of topics eg should we change maps, should we wipe, should player x be promoted/banned/allowed in faction.. usual democratic stuff. might be a good idea to implement something like this. not sure if it should be admin only or something faction leaders can do with its members too. maybe both configurable by the admin to be allowed or denied. since it would require global messaging of some sort it would probably come under the 70 news type category somehow. since votes would probably show in our news feed, and it would need to message all online players or possibly those connecting the datafile itself would be pretty basic to implement, just needs to list the vote question, the scope global or faction and the names of players and their votes. probably need an optional expiry time too. ie <vote> <creator>phoenixx steamid=1234567890</creator> <question>should we change to a new map</question> <expiry>1/2/2017 00:00</expiry> <scope>global_</scope> <responses> bob=y fred=n harry=y </responses> </vote> <vote> <creator>screaming_angel steamid=4234567890</creator> <question>should we allow fred into our faction</question> <expiry>null</expiry> <scope>faction_=blue_mining</scope> <responses> bob=y harry=n </responses> </vote>
