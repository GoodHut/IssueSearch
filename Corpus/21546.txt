 URL : "https://github.com/Raptor007/aq2-tng/issues/55" TITLE : fix team balancer? BODY : @stan0x reported that even with auto-balance enabled, players are able to join and unjoin their team during warmup, preventing the real game from starting. https://github.com/raptor007/aq2-tng/issues/15 issuecomment-280362158 a quick glance through the tng_balancer code shows some behavior that doesn't quite make sense to me. i don't usually run the balancer on my server so i'll need to do some testing first, but it seems like the auto-balance needs to be slightly redesigned to prevent players from immediately undoing its work.
