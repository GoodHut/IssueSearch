 URL : "https://github.com/mattrayner/docker-lamp/issues/23" TITLE : edit mysql configuration BODY : trying to edit /etc/mysql/conf.d/mysql.cnf or /etc/mysql/my.cnf seems to have no effect in actual server. even stopping mysql server with service mysql stop keeps phpmyadmin session alive, so i think i'm not working on real mysql server. what is the correct way to modify mysql config? i need to disable no_zero_in_date,no_zero_date and strict mode thank you
