 URL : "https://github.com/stormpath/express-stormpath/issues/620" TITLE : okta group expansion BODY : thanks to the stormpath for making this a relatively painless transition. seems to be fairly easy so far. i have run into an issue where we use groups extensively in our app and use group expansion to retrieve those on authentication. is there a similar option in the new okta world. group data doesn't seem to be included with the user object in 4-rc4. do i need to make an additional request manually?
