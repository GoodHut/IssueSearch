 URL : "https://github.com/EmbeddedMontiArc/onlineIDE/issues/6" TITLE : disable not needed plugins BODY : to improve start-up time esp. when used the first time , all not needed plugins should be disabled so that they will not be delivered and instantiated . we do not need language support for others than ema, emam so python, go, java, javascript, ... can be removed . since we have no debugging yet, this can also be removed. if you find other not useable features for our languages, you can remove them too. <img width= 552 alt= bildschirmfoto 2017-11-13 um 23 00 18 src= https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30497492/32751657-f7589268-c8c6-11e7-8703-bb4b0017d64a.png >
