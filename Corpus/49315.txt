 URL : "https://github.com/dsifford/academic-bloggers-toolkit/issues/309" TITLE : text citation feature BODY : when describing the context of a reference, it is often useful to write sentences like > as doe 1997 points out, it ... however, as far as i know with abt, one can only approximate this with > as doe doe, 1997 points out, it ... it would be nice, if the first style was available as well. in latex biber it would be the difference between textcite and autocite. i tried to find out whether it is an available feature, but to my understanding it is not implemented. would it be possible to enable this second citation type?
