 URL : "https://github.com/neveldo/jQuery-Mapael/issues/358" TITLE : multiple tooltip instances BODY : i am building out a custom map experience and mapael allows me to accomplish most everything i am looking to do out of the box. essentially, the project involves a map of the us, with cities plotted from some json data. i built a custom 'tooltip' window based on some more json data for each state that is activated upon touching the corresponding state area. the positioning of these is fixed, so that piece is all set. is there a method of disabling area clicks from triggering the tooltip entirely? area clicks currently reset my plot tooltips additionally, a goal with the plots is to be able to touch them to show the tooltip, while subsequent touches would create a _new_ instance of the tooltip, leaving the other s as is until the area/plot is activated again. i need the 'tooltip' windows for the plots to be positioned as they are out of the box - based on the coords of the plot. is there any sort of use case functionality like this that has been used, or do i need to create this entirely custom?
