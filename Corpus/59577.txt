 URL : "https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-service-discovery/issues/57" TITLE : update docs on website BODY : it seems like the docs at http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-service-discovery/java/ _implementing_your_own_service_type are not uptodate with the information in this repo. especcialy the part about implementing your own service says on the website: > create a meta-inf/services/io.vertx.ext.discovery.spi.servicetype but the correct way this file should be named, since the classpath changed is: > create a meta-inf/services/io.vertx.servicediscovery.spi.servicetype file also wrong : > create a class extending io.vertx.ext.discovery.types.abstractservicereference since the loading of your own spi fails silently if you just copy pasted the filename, the docs should probably be updated. i did not check if other parts of the docs are outdated, maybe?
