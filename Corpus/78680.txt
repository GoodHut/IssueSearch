 URL : "https://github.com/QMCPACK/qmcpack/issues/253" TITLE : readfilebuffer needs fix BODY : the unit test crashes in mpi when pp file is missing. this is introduced in 251 the reason is that is_open is not initialized and always set in open_file. is_open must be initialized to false and set to false if an open failed. open_file should check if a file is open or not before try to open anther file.
