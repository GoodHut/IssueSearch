 URL : "https://github.com/sunpy/ndcube/issues/15" TITLE : add example to docs BODY : adding a few examples to the docs of how to instantiate and manipulate ndcube objects would be really helpful. thanks for ndcube. seems like it could be quite useful for instruments e.g. hinode/eis as well as 3d spatial data e.g. solarbextrapolation . i think a few examples would show easily how it could be used in these other projects.
