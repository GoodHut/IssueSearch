 URL : "https://github.com/withoutboats/failure/issues/97" TITLE : problems with context BODY : i'm currently busy with adding failure into svdparser https://github.com/japaric/svd/ . i've come up with a pattern to enable what i'd like to call conditional errors enums, where one variant is for a specific error, and the other is when that specific error didn't occur and an error occured later. i'll try to make a minimal example later but for now you can see where this pattern doesn't succeed here https://github.com/emilgardis/svd/blob/2dadc2500913b02a1aa13d33d2a826bf01925f48/tests/bad_svd.rs l51 . on l22 i downcast to peripheralerror without any problems, however, at l51 i have to downcast as a context . that should be easily fixed by making downcast on a d should also try downcast with typeid::of::<context<d> i believe this should also be part of 93 as that seems something closely related to other problems i have, see l55, where the cause of the peripheralerror doesn't exist, even though it is made as such here https://github.com/emilgardis/svd/blob/2dadc2500913b02a1aa13d33d2a826bf01925f48/src/errors.rs l75 .
