 URL : "https://github.com/JuliaEditorSupport/julia-vscode/issues/255" TITLE : julia busy all the time BODY : ever since upgrading to 0.7, julia is indicated as busy forever after trying to get completion or hovering over e.g. a function. function help or completions also never appear. it seems to work on the first few functions sometimes, but then it gets stuck with no errors in the language server log. is there some cache or something i can reset? i've been going through quite a few versions of the vscode plugin.
