 URL : "https://github.com/VirtoCommerce/vc-storefront/issues/53" TITLE : sold out badge BODY : the sold-out badge is put on items when the is buyable is false on the catalog item. the productavailabilityservice -> isavailable is used for this check. in my opinion if the item is not buyable it does not meen it is sold out. i could be wrong.. maybe a issoldout or isbuyable property on the service would be better and more explained.
