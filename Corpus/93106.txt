 URL : "https://github.com/jackfirth/racket-disposable/issues/96" TITLE : add disposable memoization BODY : memoization is when a function remembers what it returns when called and reuses that result in future calls with the same arguments. this can be extended to disposables to convert a function that returns a disposable into a disposable of a function that returns an allocated value. useful for memoizing functions that return things like database connections.
