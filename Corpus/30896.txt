 URL : "https://github.com/Secretmapper/combustion/issues/18" TITLE : release up to date? BODY : hello, just let you know i'm not really into code, i just can use ssh, guess things, and try to learn before asking, but after installing the theme in a manual way, i had the problem of the progress bar not displaying in percentage, or event the title saying combustion - transmission ... . seeing the percentage issue as been solved, i was wondering how can i use the files available in this github to have an up-to-date version? ps: don't know if really an issue or me that can't use github, but daaaamn, this theme is great!! also don't know if it's because of my version or it's in a todo thing, but when making rightclick on a torrent i just have the resume now option, not the other ones, remove, etc. . anyway, big thank you!!!! kind regards
