 URL : "https://github.com/Grarak/KernelAdiutor/issues/550" TITLE : custom constrols list mess BODY : hi, i'm encountering a mess when adding/editing own custom controls. the list seems poorly updated or misordered. after adding or editing item, the entry seems placed at wrong position of another control + the switch state doesn't correspond to real state. the list titles seem match real entries only when i exit ka and open it in new instance. please check it.
