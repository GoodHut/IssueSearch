 URL : "https://github.com/KELiON/cerebro/issues/390" TITLE : initialize not triggering BODY : i am using the following code right now js 'use strict'; function init { console.log done ; } function main { term, display } { display { title: you've entered ${term} } ; } module.exports = { initialize: init, fn: main }; done never ends up being logged in the console for some reason and even trying to use breakpoints seems to fail completely, as initialize is never called for me.
