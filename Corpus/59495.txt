 URL : "https://github.com/GuildCrafts/prrr/issues/130" TITLE : unclear button meaning BODY : as a user reviewing a prrr, it is not immediately clear what the results of clicking skip or abandon will be. specifically, if i press either of these buttons, will i ever be able to claim the prrr again? this might be solved with text appearing on mouse-over of the buttons.
