 URL : "https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/22156" TITLE : first touch test failures BODY : i expected master, as of the time of writing to restore, build, and test without failure. i actually observe the test run failing. i'm running windows 10 vm in parallels on a macbookpro. ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4120386/30508007-fa8e5be2-9a5a-11e7-9646-304cfb6888ff.png the gaurd page warning comes from csrss . so that's weird. instead, i attach to the console test runner at 13948: ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4120386/30508047-aa82846a-9a5b-11e7-91ea-6f2338786c10.png which has a command line of: ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4120386/30508050-be18ea78-9a5b-11e7-9162-22004aabfba6.png and i find the runner raised a debugger.break : ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4120386/30508080-74ffce14-9a5c-11e7-9659-7226d1ce8a72.png and if i hit f5 a few times i hit the same debugger.break until finally the test finishes and i show all tests pass: ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4120386/30508114-18972b4e-9a5d-11e7-8bda-bd72560dd075.png though i expected no failures, i'd expect if a dialog pops up because a test hit a debug break point, that ultimately the test runner would show a failed test. let me know if you need more information. happens every time on my vm.
