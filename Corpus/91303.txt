 URL : "https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/9979" TITLE : textarea resizer is small BODY : not sure if this is a bug but the resize grabber located in the bottom right corner of a textarea is really small. so small that it's almost unusable. however, in chrome, the size is much larger. this is clearly not an issue of some css in my app. even the electron demo app exhibits this. is this an issue with the chrome version used by electron or has electron put something in that is causing this? electron version: 1.6.11 operating system: macos
