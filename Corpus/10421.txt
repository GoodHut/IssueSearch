 URL : "https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf4-python/issues/692" TITLE : cdo grid failure BODY : i am using netcdf4-python to create netcdf4 files.to create a dimensional variable: createdimension createvariable to create other variables: createvariable dset.name, dset.dtype, dims it works well with panoply or ncdump, but when examined with cdo sinfo 'grid coordinates' shows generic instead of lonlat , and unsurprisingly cdo cant subset the dataset: cdo sellonlatbox abort : unsupported grid type! does anyone here know the solution? thanks,-- jay
