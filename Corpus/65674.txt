 URL : "https://github.com/simon816/ChatUI/issues/4" TITLE : just a couple questions BODY : now that i have chatui installed on the server, configured and working, how would i go about creating a tab that prints when a command is used? as an example, i want to know when someone uses /give <player> <item> or /kick <player> reason also, if someone with the node chatui.admin.group.create creates a group, will any groups they create be global for everyone with chatui enabled or only for themself? i am going to assume it's global somewhat related to the last question. would it be possible to have custom group nodes? something like chatui.admin.group.create.<customgroup> and then a new node chatui.admin.group.join.<customgroup>
