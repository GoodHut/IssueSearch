 URL : "https://github.com/solict/PHP.Stack.Docker/issues/16" TITLE : volumes default path BODY : the default path for host volumes tested with manjaro linux arch and macos is /var/lib/docker/volumes. macos is unable to create /var/lib/docker/volumes/other-folders even when run as root. i've tried to create the folder manually /var/lib/docker/volumes/debian8_mariadb10_data/_data and docker is unable to bind. from my personal opinion, i would like data folders created on each distro folder, within a volumes folder. this strategy would solve the problem with relative paths on volume configurations for each docker-compose.yml file. ex. volumes: ./volumes/mariadb10_data:/var/lib/mysql
