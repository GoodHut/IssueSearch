 URL : "https://github.com/bradleyfalzon/gopherci/issues/48" TITLE : ignore non-go projects BODY : as a user, i might have non-go projects which don't need to be checked. i don't want the status api to appear as pending at all if there are no go files at all. after a clone we could find . -type f -name ' .go' , and if there's no go files, abort early. right now, this would result in gopherci appearing in status api for a short period, but wouldn't run any tools, fetch dependencies etc. for large projects, this could be slow, but would almost certainly be faster than other ci tools if there's no queue . another option maybe checking the github api for which languages exist in the repository, but this would then be github specific, and i'd like the avoid that if we can. another benefit to this change is lowering the resources that gopherci uses.
