 URL : "https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-openshift-agent/issues/154" TITLE : be able to exclude metrics BODY : agent can be told to collect jolokia mbeans using mbean patterns e.g. domain:type= . agent can also be told to collect prometheus metrics that are labeled e.g. if a metric named foo is labeled, all labeled metrics are stored as different time series . it would be nice to be able to tell the agent to exclude certain metrics. for example if a set of jmx mbeans are: domain:type:one domain:type:two domain:type:a domain:type:b we should be able to tell the agent to exclude the a and b mbeans but still collect metrics from one and two . so perhaps something like this can be in the config file this is just a guess how it could be implemented, but you get the idea : metrics: - name: domain:type: exclude: - type: a - type: b we need to support being able to exclude based on multiple labels: metrics: - name: domain:type: ,subtype= exclude: - type: a subtype: aprime - type: b subtype: bprime
