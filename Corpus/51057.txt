 URL : "https://github.com/stefanpenner/heapsnapshot/issues/9" TITLE : add node retained size BODY : hi stefan, i've actually done quite a bit of work on exactly this task and would suggest that one of the most valuable pieces of data about a node is it's retained size. to calculate that, you need to construct a dominator tree so that you can aggregate all dependent nodes sizes. i'm sure you've seen it, but webkit does this here: https://github.com/webkit/webkit/blob/master/source/webinspectorui/userinterface/workers/heapsnapshot/heapsnapshot.js l590 i'm currently working on a couple of other features for my personal project, but if there's interest in a couple of weeks i'm happy to circle around and mock up a pr.
