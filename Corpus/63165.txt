 URL : "https://github.com/evidenceontology/evidenceontology/issues/139" TITLE : design pattern examples BODY : when we receive ntrs they often have an implicit is about component. for example, see 136 that asks for the label self reported ancestry . in my opinion, this could be reworked was self reported information evidence that is about ancestry . questions: 1. how many eco classes exist that have this sort of design pattern? 2. does eco have rules in place for deciding when to make such a term - or when not to? 3. how many design patterns exist in eco?
