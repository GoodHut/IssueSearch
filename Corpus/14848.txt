 URL : "https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph.physics.simulator/issues/3" TITLE : centering force ? BODY : i have a disconnected graph. i use forcelayout3d. currently my different clusters repel each others and move away indefinitely... of course i need my nodes not to overlap, so repels is needed. but when the clusters are in distinct positions, they should stop to move, no need for the node to run far away... is there a way to fix that ?
