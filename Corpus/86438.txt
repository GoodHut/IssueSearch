BODY : when i tried to install on debian 7 minimal, first i installed cmake by apt-get install cmake but then cmake .. results in: root@vps:~/shot/build cmake .. cmake error: cmake was unable to find a build program corresponding to unix makefiles . cmake_make_program is not set. you probably need to select a different build tool. cmake error: error required internal cmake variable not set, cmake may be not be built correctly. missing variable is: cmake_c_compiler_env_var cmake error: error required internal cmake variable not set, cmake may be not be built correctly. missing variable is: cmake_c_compiler cmake error: could not find cmake module file:/root/shot/build/cmakefiles/cmakeccompiler.cmake cmake error: error required internal cmake variable not set, cmake may be not be built correctly. missing variable is: cmake_cxx_compiler_env_var cmake error: error required internal cmake variable not set, cmake may be not be built correctly. missing variable is: cmake_cxx_compiler cmake error: could not find cmake module file:/root/shot/build/cmakefiles/cmakecxxcompiler.cmake cmake error: cmake_c_compiler not set, after enablelanguage cmake error: cmake_cxx_compiler not set, after enablelanguage -- configuring incomplete, errors occurred! any ideas how to fix this?
