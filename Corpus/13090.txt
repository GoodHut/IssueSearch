 URL : "https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_runtime/issues/27" TITLE : support for ping BODY : this would be really helpful to have a simple elixir-based ping command to verify network connectivity as part of the helpers. i'd be find with another solution that doesn't involve icmp just so that it works against and access point and doesn't require the internet to be connected like wget'ing some web page .
