 URL : "https://github.com/realbigplugins/edd-fields/issues/78" TITLE : fields for variations BODY : right now our fields are based on the download and have no consideration for the download's variations if it is a variable product. it could be very useful to support fields for variations. when we do this, it may be that we expand the fields metabox to include the variations or we may somehow incorporate our fields into the pricing metabox which, as of edd 2.8, will be much more friendly to new fields.
