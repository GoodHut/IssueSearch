 URL : "https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/39441" TITLE : node audit logging BODY : we should have a better story about audit logging on nodes. this is a fairly broad topic that could include: - host access ssh, privileged pods / host volumes / etc, credential changes - kubelet api access - pod access exec / attach / portforward - what is running on the node both in & out of pods i think we should treat application pod audit logging as a separate topic, with the possible exception of kernel audit logs e.g. apparmor violations . we should have a pluggable way to push or extract the audit logs to a remote location. i'm not sure whether this needs to be a separate system from our current logging pipeline s e.g. fluentd . api non-kubelet audit logging is a separate issue tracked in https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/22 @kubernetes/sig-node-misc @kubernetes/sig-auth-misc
