 URL : "https://github.com/whatwg/notifications/issues/107" TITLE : defer & queue BODY : the accessible platform architectures apa working group at the w3c believes there are significant use cases requiring api support for do not disturb functionality in various web applications, whether accessed via mobile device or desktop browser. we are advised by w3c colleagues that the appropriate locus for our feature request is the notification specification. one such use case is the conclusion of a financial transaction where it is critical that the key terms of the transaction can be completed without distracting interruptions--which could also trigger timeouts that would exaserbate the user's ability to complete the transaction. the key juncture of a financial transaction might include the screen where payment is finally authorized, a digital signature is applied, and an accessible receipt is recieved. another use case is to prevent a list of items from scrolling while a screen reader user is iterating through the list. push actions which result in scrolling exaserbate the user's ability to function smoothly by causing the focus to shift outside the user's control. we note this kind of functionality is available heuristically on mobile platforms. an example android application providing similar functionality is: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tryagent however, what is needed is the ability to temporarily suspend push notifications via an api call, so that an application can invoke a do not disturb feature based on context, and so that users may gain easier access to turning notifications on and off directly, whatever the platform, without navigating multiple menus. we propose the addition of a section in support of this feature requirement as follows: section 2.12 defer and queue when this flag is set no notifications are delivered to the user interface. rather they are queued for display once the flag is cleared.
