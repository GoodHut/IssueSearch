 URL : "https://github.com/mxmoss/fll2013challenge/issues/12" TITLE : genericize the calculator BODY : the first iteration of this calculator was created to re-implement the 2013 fll calculator for the nature's fury challenge. after moving most of the year-specific information into json files, it's apparent that there are other parts of the project that should be made more generic. suggested solution: replace any reference to fll2013challenge with fllchallengecalc - rename this repo to fllchallengecalc - rename the github pages url to fllchallengecalc - other items?
