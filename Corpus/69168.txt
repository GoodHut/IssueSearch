 URL : "https://github.com/poissonconsulting/poisspatial/issues/18" TITLE : subset fwa routes layer BODY : need to find a way to query the geodatabase to subset routes before loading into r. currently, the routes layer is too large to load into r, yet it is probably the most useful layer centerlines . alternatively, could split the geodatabase into individual sqlite files, each representing a watershed region of routes - maybe in qgis? another possible avenue: r-arcgis bridge?
