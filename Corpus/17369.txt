 URL : "https://github.com/hiqdev/asset-packagist/issues/40" TITLE : package not found BODY : i am including the following package bower-asset/scriptaculous-bower from bower through asset-packagist which used to work since today. now it gives a message that the package exists but is rejected by composer. i stripped down the composer.json to { name : test/test , require : { bower-asset/scriptaculous-bower : ^1.9 }, repositories : { type : composer , url : https://asset-packagist.org } } when running composer install i am receiving the following error message the requested package bower-asset/scriptaculous-bower ^1.9 exists as bower-asset/scriptaculous-bower 1.9.0, 1.8.1, dev-master but these are rejected by your constraint. this used to work before, if i change the requirement to ^1.8 it works and 1.8.1 is installed. the message is kinda weird because 1.9.0 is present and composer even knows about it. not sure if it is a problem with asset-packagist, but nor the original bower package neither the entry at asset-packagist.org have changed lately.
