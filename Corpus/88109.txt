 URL : "https://github.com/fcps/dra-standards/issues/4" TITLE : modify naming conventions BODY : suggestion was made to use a few different naming conventions for some of the common data elements listed in https://github.com/fcps/dra-standards/blob/gh-pages/_includes/naming.md. instead of firstnm and lastnm using fname and lname for students' first/last names. @fcps/data using the nm suffix would reduce keystrokes in several instances e.g., tchfirstnm for teacher's first name, schnm for school name, etc... . conversely name is certainly clearer and requires no interpretation e.g., schname is a clearer representation , but for people's first/last names e.g., tchfname vs tchfirstnm there is less distinction between the two conventions. so, we need to decide whether to abbreviate one or both parts of the reference e.g., the parts of a name : first , middle , or last to f , m , l and the data : name or nm . i tend to favor using fewer keystrokes as often as possible, but if there is a compelling reason/rationale for not abbreviating things at all i'm open to hearing that out as well. remember that the goal with the naming conventions is to make it easier for us all to operate on the data in which ever language s and/or tools we are using so we can reuse code more effectively e.g., if we know the names of the data elements it is easier to develop different parts of a pipeline independently .
