 URL : "https://github.com/mapbox/dyno/issues/136" TITLE : the purpose of dyno BODY : i was talking with @rclark about the purpose of dyno vs the javascript object friendly aws client last night and wanted to document what we said to help us keep focused on the new goals of this project since a large part of the original goal has been solved by aws themselves. 1. support reading from one region and writing to another 2. better support for streaming 3. better support for bulk read and write actions i'd like to rework the readme to clarify these goals. is there anything else we should cover? i'd also like to take a look at stuff dyno does that doesn't fall under the stated goals and talk about removing the functionality or being explicit that this is a goal. one thing dyno does now that isn't mentioned above is provide cli support.
