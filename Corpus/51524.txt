 URL : "https://github.com/deanm/omggif/issues/23" TITLE : are you accepting prs? BODY : i have written a gif animation library using jimp that supports pluggable encoders and decoders. i made a default codec by wrapping omggif. however, i'm finding problems requiring correction. is this repo still active, or should i maintain my own copy of omggif with my library copying forward your license , as jimp does? the errors so far are: 1 i have an improperly formed gif that sends omggif into an infinite loop. 2 omggif should throw instances of error to capture the stack trace of the code that handed omggif improper data. it currently throws strings. thanks for your help. i'm really impressed with this library. fyi, by necessity, my test suite is becoming a test suite for omggif.
