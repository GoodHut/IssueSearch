_originally opened as https://github.com/cnplab/clickos/issues/23_ ---- hi, fillipe: sorry for bothering again, yet i was wondering if there is some way to change the ring size without making the clickos image again, is it possible to change in the example.cfg scripts or through command line? could the ring size diff from clickos-0 dom1 to clickos-1 dom2 ? also, i was wondering if you still have the mirror.click files tested before, wire wr , ethermirror em , ip router ir , load balancer lb and flow monitor fm ?
