 URL : "https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxCpp/issues/403" TITLE : flat_map with scoped BODY : i found an potential issue with flat_map operation when source the is a scoped observable using a factory holding a shared pointer. in this case my shared pointer is not released after the last unsubscribe of the observable returned by flat_map. i didn't succeed to produce a minimal example that trigger this issue, but a quick and dirty hack seems to solve the issue: if i reset the state_type source which is manly not used : this->source = source_type ; my smart pointer is released when i unsubscribe. maybe this is an issue on my side, but i go many times through my code, i don't see the issue
