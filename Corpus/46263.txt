 URL : "https://github.com/google/badwolf/issues/63" TITLE : long running instance BODY : excuse for the probably very naive question. i think i have a working badwolf instance, which i obtained by go get golang.org/x/net/context go get github.com/peterh/liner go get github.com/google/badwolf/... is this the right way? it is not mentioned anywhere how to install . in any case, i am able to use the bw tool and follow the examples, use bw bql to get a repl and so on. the question is: how do i leave a long running instance of badwolf? even assuming i want to keep the data in ram persistence is not a priority right now, even though i see there are persistent backends https://github.com/xllora/bwdrivers each time i run the bw an entire new instance of badwolf is created and apparently destroyed. i assume there must be some way to leave badwolf running in the background and keep querying the existing graphs even using the bw tool, preferably with some kind of driver/network interface but i could not find any information on this
