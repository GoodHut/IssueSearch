 URL : "https://github.com/rflachlan/Luscinia/issues/4" TITLE : measure of amplitude BODY : hello, i played a sound back in a same condition, same volume then i recorded it at different distances. i was expecting the amplitude would decrease with the distance. however, the measurement said the opposite. amplitude mean was 22 at 1m and 30 at 15m. i was using the same settings for the measurements. to export the parameters, i compressed syllable measures. however, the same pattern occurred if i used the option uncompressed element measures lower amplitude at closer distance and higher amplitude at farther distance . i am attaching screenshots of the sonograms and the result of the measurements. unfortunately, i cannot attach the wav file here but i will be happy to send them to you if needed. ! at_1m https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32803802/31579769-2ab93a10-b146-11e7-816f-a77c3c81bbcb.png ! at_15m https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32803802/31579770-2b00b0b6-b146-11e7-8480-c8ecf2a80fde.png amplitude.measurment.xlsx https://github.com/rflachlan/luscinia/files/1385038/amplitude.measurment.xlsx
