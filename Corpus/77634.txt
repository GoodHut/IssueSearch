 URL : "https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/issues/6416" TITLE : no style guide for bazel BODY : since 6384, we enforce code style on bazel/skylark stuff, which means that developers editing such files should really remember to run the tests before submitting pr's. however, we do not currently document this, or make any mention of these style rules. we should consider adding a bazel/skylark section to the style guides.
