 URL : "https://github.com/gunyarakun/timezone_finder/issues/1" TITLE : 1.5.6 -> 1.5.7 api break BODY : hi, really like the gem, however i do feel i need to criticise the update. it doesn't really warrant an issue, perhaps, so feel free to close it whenever. it's fine to update the api, however, then you _have_ to up the minor or major version. the patch is only meant for backwards-compatible changes. i had my gemfile set up with 1.5.x so i would get the patches. but the automatic update broke it :/ thanks :
