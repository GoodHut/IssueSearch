 URL : "https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift/issues/210" TITLE : allow returning a promise? BODY : i'm trying to write a codemod that opens tickets for each todo or fixme in my code and updates the in-code comments to include the link to the ticket. as far as i can tell, that's currently impossible given jscodemod's api is synchronous. is there a way to do this now? if not, would you be open to a pr that allows the transform function to return a promise?
