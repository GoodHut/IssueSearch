 URL : "https://github.com/paragonie/sodium_compat/issues/36" TITLE : crypto_pwhash_ methods BODY : i was hoping to use the 7.2 style syntax for these methods, but they aren't provided in here. is there any change of bringing them in like memzero , where they throw an exception on default php? on the same note, would that mean all methods would appear in this library? are these the only missing ones?
