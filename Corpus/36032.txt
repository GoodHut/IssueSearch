 URL : "https://github.com/killjoy1221/HD-Font-Generator/issues/3" TITLE : font fallback stack? BODY : is it possible to make the font fall back to another font if the letter is not supported? i know that css can do it, and minecraft does it by default. for example, i have a font called nihonium that i want to use for ascii, latin a, latin b, and greek, but if that is not supported in the font, i want to specify the program to use pixelm+, a japanese pixel font, and if that isn't supported either, probably the default unicode font for minecraft.
