 URL : "https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16851" TITLE : combine aws api calls? BODY : i've been having problems with how long a converge takes where the environment is 1,500+ aws_instance resources, as many ebs volumes, and quite a few other resources currently averages around 10 minutes to do a terraform refresh with terraform 0.10.8, with provider 1.2.0 . the speed is not so much a problem as that we're bumping against aws rate limits. when looking into aws_instance resource's code it looks like it's doing a single describeinstances api call http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/ec2/ ec2.describeinstances for each instance: https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/blob/4d7ccced1862ef5323427a91048fee093291e8f6/aws/resource_aws_instance.go l1069 specifying multiple instances per call and doing any additional processing locally might also alleviate some of the timeout issues i've seen some folks have. before i or anyone else starts working on a patch, are there gotchas that i'm missing that has kept the number of requests o n to this point?
