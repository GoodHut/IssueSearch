 URL : "https://github.com/harthur/rainbow/issues/15" TITLE : issues with inspector BODY : when i click inspector and go down to webpage, no matter what color iâ€™m over it only shows fff color on inspector preview. if i go up to address bar and toolbar it works like normal, but when going down to any webpage it turns to fff automatically and stays that way. have already removed add-on and re-added and still experiencing issue. is there a fix for this?
