 URL : "https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc/issues/152" TITLE : exact line modified BODY : hello, i've used cloc for a while now and i find it very useful, specially the diff functionality. but i was wondering if there is an option to print out exactly which lines have been modified, the exact line numbers for each file pair analyzed, in the report, or maybe in the alignment file when using --diff-alignment . if this is not currently supported, which is the best way to tackle this modification? i've been taking a look at the code, but my perl is terrible. thanks for the tool and for your time aurelio
