 URL : "https://github.com/pni-libraries/libpniio/issues/64" TITLE : implement path conversion BODY : in a first step we need some means of conversion between hdf5::path and nexus::path . from hdf5::path to nexus::path this direction is rather trivial as a valid hdf5::path is also a valid nexus::path though it is missing the additional class information. from nexus::path to hdf5::path this is only possible if the nexus::path is unique in the sense that all elements have their object name entry set. in this case the conversion would again be trivial. however, if the nexus path is not unique we cannot convert it to an hdf5 path. possible implementation the only thing we can change is the nexus path class. thus, for the conversion from hdf5 to nexus we could use a conversion constructor and for the other direction the conversion operator. cpp namespace nexus { class path { public: path const hdf5::path &hdf5_path ; operator hdf5::path ; }; } we deliberately do not set both as explicit to make the conversion as simple as possible for the user. whether or not this is a good idea will turn out on the long run.
