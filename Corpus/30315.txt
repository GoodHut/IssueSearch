 URL : "https://github.com/TeamPorcupine/ProjectPorcupine/issues/1777" TITLE : overlaymap ui error BODY : overlaymap.cs around line 570 has the following: colormapview.addcomponent<unityengine.ui.image> ; colormapview.transform.setparent parentpanel.transform ; colormapview.addcomponent<unityengine.ui.text> ; and unity complains: > can't add 'text' to new game object because a 'image' is already added to the game object! a gameobject can only contain one 'graphic' component. currently its only using an image, are there any problems with this ui as a result? either way this has to be fixed or the addcomponent<unityengine.ui.text> should be removed
