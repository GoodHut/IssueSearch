 URL : "https://github.com/katspaugh/wavesurfer.js/issues/1059" TITLE : draw on pixel boundaries BODY : wavesurfer.js version s : 1.3.2 browser version s : firefox 52 code needed to reproduce the issue: var wavesurfer = wavesurfer.create { barwidth: 2, container: ' waveform', cursorwidth: 0, height: 32, interact: false, normalize: true, pixelratio: 1, wavecolor: 'orange', } ; wavesurfer.load 'audio.wav' ; result: ! waveform-antialiased https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/282030/24758722/1e6d302e-1adb-11e7-9bb1-d9acfec4889c.png this waveform is looking good, but when i zoom in on a screenshot of it, i can see that each bar isn't actually separated from its neighbours fully - they have what looks like an antialiased edge on the left of each. it looks as though each bar ends on a multiple of three pixels barwidth 2 plus a single pixel space so i'm not sure what's causing the canvas to have to do what looks like interpolation. is there a way to get a clean edge to each bar so there are only two colours appearing in the rendered canvas?
