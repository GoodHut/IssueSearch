 URL : "https://github.com/thahmann/macleod/issues/10" TITLE : pretty print ontology.py BODY : at the current moment the __repr__ function just recursively calls __repr__ on it's list of imports and axioms. the result is basically a dfs through the import tree that, while cool to watch, is not very helpful when visually parsing it. it would be better to mimic the approach used in the previous version where we first accumulate all the imports then print them. this is closely related to the other ticket about possibly reducing the duplicate imports.
