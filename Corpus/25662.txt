 URL : "https://github.com/Firemoon777/StatusModifier/issues/2" TITLE : <bug> free ram 0 mb BODY : i don't want the ram to constantly be updating all the time. i am ok with one refresh per minute. the problem is that when i select '60s' as the refresh time, it starts off at 0mb at bootup and it takes a minute before it displays the actual free ram. it would be better to display the initial value for free ram rather than nothing at all.
