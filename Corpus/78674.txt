 URL : "https://github.com/CodingTrain/Rainbow-Topics/issues/684" TITLE : reaction diffusion in 3d BODY : i have been looking at form generation from rd in 3d, and modified your script to generate point clouds in 3d script attached . however, i found it rather tricky to visualize and extract form from the point cloud. i came across a technique called marching cubes that generates convex hulls for points with values beyond a certain threshold, thus generating forms in 3d. however, i found the code to be quite tricky for my level of programming and i am having trouble translating it into processing. so i was wondering if you would be interested in it, maybe as a coding challenge for your channel haha! thank you for your time! reaction diffusion 3d.txt https://github.com/codingtrain/rainbow-topics/files/1404508/reaction.diffusion.3d.txt
