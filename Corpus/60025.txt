 URL : "https://github.com/LightsHope/server/issues/10" TITLE : warrior flurry issues. BODY : ive noticed that warrior cleave and heroic strike are not removing a flurry stack. also some whirlwind and cleave crits are not proccing flurry every time they crit, they do procc off the main target when they do, but not off extra targets. this may also be an issue with sweeping strikes but i haven't tried that out as its not oftein warriors use sweeping with flurry unless they go 21/30/0 please if you could fix this asap as to not imbalance the class or make it less viable or abused in raids.
