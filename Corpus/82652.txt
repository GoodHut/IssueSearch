 URL : "https://github.com/veg/hyphy/issues/528" TITLE : analysing a gene fragment BODY : dear hyphy producers, is it valid to use datamonkey to analyse a fragment of a gene? we have sequenced toll-like receptor genes for multiple individuals by dividing them into 5 shorter fragments - my supervisor asked me to look for positively selected sites in one of the fragments for which we have the most individuals sequenced. this is the fragment with the only two non-synonymous snps of the gene so will analysing it separately not introduce a bias in the ratio of ds/dn? the fragments themselves were assigned in a way arbitrarily length ca. 500bp as a way of sequencing the whole gene. thank you in advance.
