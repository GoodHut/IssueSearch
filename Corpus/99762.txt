 URL : "https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/issues/6909" TITLE : new project: bioconda-data BODY : hi all, i was wondering if anyone has thought about leveraging the conda system for for reference data. there's already been some work towards this in the gogetdata project https://github.com/gogetdata/ggd-recipes by @arq5x and it has been adapted by @chapmanb to be used in cloudbiolinux https://github.com/chapmanb/cloudbiolinux/tree/master/ggd-recipes . i think this endeavour would be a great fit for bioconda, and it would be a tremendous help to the community to have a go to version control system for reference data. i'd love to hear some thoughts and comments towards this. i'm aware that costs for storage and network traffic may be limiting factors, but it'd be wonderful to have something like this. perhaps wild speculation, bear with me here a collaboration with the elixir project https://www.elixir-europe.org could be organized to offset some costs. an initiative like this looks like something along the lines of their bio.tools repo. let me know what you think! cheers m
