 URL : "https://github.com/crosire/scripthookvdotnet/issues/625" TITLE : shvdn with openvhook? BODY : hello, these are very sad times for all of use. since openiv got a c&d from t2 and alexander blade is also a tem member of openiv it's very likely that scripthookv will never get updated. i found out there is a replacement for scripthookv. it's openvhook https://github.com/jackd111/openvhook . however, i guess things are not so easy. first off idk if it's fully compatible with shv and second, shvdn refers shv. so my question is, is the shvdn team discussing a separate version of shvdn which calls into openvhook?
