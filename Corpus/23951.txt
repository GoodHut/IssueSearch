 URL : "https://github.com/rfmvh/perfevents-result-collector/issues/4" TITLE : rfe add debug mode BODY : the dbconnection class methods query and select offer debug boolean parameter, which defaults to false . when true , it prints out all the db queries when sent to db. we currently do not have any mean to enable that. either --debug option or an env variable like debug=1 might enable debugmode, so debug would be true and queries would be printed.
