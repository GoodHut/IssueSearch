BODY : hi, since you implemented the pop ups after the tow is complete to disconnect/re-connect. maybe another one when tug driver is standing showing the pins to acknowledge that we have seen him and are clear to proceed. i have seen some guys standing airside getting annoyed waiting on the pilot to acknowledge them so they could leave. :
