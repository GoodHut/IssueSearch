 URL : "https://github.com/vhelin/wla-dx/issues/136" TITLE : _sizeof_ label name BODY : it's be nice if there was an auto-generated symbol for each named label which was the count in bytes from it to the next such label. this would make it a lot easier to capture the lengths of data blobs, for example: label: .asc some message here .define _sizeof_label next_label-label ; automate this next_label: typically i find that the .define doesn't work nicely because of the lexical positioning typically being after where i want to use it anyway.
