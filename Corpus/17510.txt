 URL : "https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester/issues/477" TITLE : post 6.0.0 design BODY : we would like to design a more modern, flexible, and hopefully smaller web-component-tester after we take care of supporting the polymer 2.0 release. some potential goals of this could include: - separation of concerns between test discovery and launching, browser launching, and test libraries. - reuse standard ecosystem testing infrastructure as much as possible - reduce the download size of the library - support multiple, or completely bring-your-own, client-side testing libraries. don't require mocha. - speed up tests by keeping browsers open between tests. - allow multiple projects with different test runner dependencies to be tested together, like tattoo but without as tight of a coupling to wct - allow combination client/server tests to be written. - support headless chrome
