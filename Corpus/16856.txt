 URL : "https://github.com/badaix/snapcast/issues/182" TITLE : may be unrelated. BODY : pretty standard setup on arch using mpd, mpd and snapserver happen to be in an lxc machine, but reproduced in different hardware and in/out of lxc. when switching tracks, manually, automatically, any way, sometimes often or mostly , the sound output becomes terribly garbled static, the sound is still there, and still some distorted version of the stream. pausing and unpausing the playback in mpd resets/solves the sound issue. confusing, but maybe stream handoff or stream formats aren't meshing? i've tweaked some of the settings in mpd output and the snapserver stream, but no luck so far. snapserver_opts= -d -s pipe:///tmp/fifo-snd.fifo?name=mpdsnap&sampleformat=44100 :16:2 maybe the -s bug was affecting, but feel free to rewrite the line. using with 4 way bluetooth on 4 machines so far, aiming for a total 6, but struggling with android clients and may order some pi if any recommendations.
