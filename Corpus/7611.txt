 URL : "https://github.com/blacklabelops/bitbucket/issues/23" TITLE : home is not set BODY : the home environment variable is not set for the bitbucket user. this results in the following benign error when executing a bash shell in the image: $ docker-compose exec -u bitbucket bitbucket bash bash: /root/.bashrc: permission denied bash-4.3$ echo $home /root bash-4.3$ id uid=1000 bitbucket gid=1000 bitbucket groups=1000 bitbucket however, more importantly, it throws the following warning when trying to clone from any repositories $ git clone ssh://git@host:2222/<xxx>.git cloning into '<xxx>'... remote: warning: unable to access '/root/.config/git/attributes': permission denied <------------------ remote: counting objects: 822, done. remote: compressing objects: 100% 701/701 , done. remote: total 822 delta 326 , reused 390 delta 79 receiving objects: 100% 822/822 , 14.92 mib | 32.16 mib/s, done. resolving deltas: 100% 326/326 , done. setting home=/home/bitbucket in the environment section of my compose file fixes this. so i assume it would work out of the box, if this was added to the dockerfile. testet with blacklabelops/bitbucket:5.3.1
