 URL : "https://github.com/bradmartin/nativescript-videoplayer/issues/53" TITLE : listview video reloading BODY : hello, when using in listview and scrolling, each video player frame reloads its source. it happens as soon as you scroll away from the listview item and come back to it. it results in some lag or delay when you scroll. after scrolling up and down many times some video player instances are loosing their sources. is there a way to prevent the video instance from reloading multiple times once it has loaded first time ? may be you should check in the source if the url was loaded before enabling the reload .. thanks.
