 URL : "https://github.com/esdalmaijer/PyGaze/issues/98" TITLE : tobii pro sdk support BODY : pygaze doesn't currently implement the new tobii sdk, module tobii_research : http://developer.tobiipro.com/python/python-sdk-reference-guide.html i've successfully adapted an experiment to use this sdk using inline code in opensesame, so i think i'm in a position to try and add this. i'm creating this issue to flag it up to anyone else who is interested and as a reminder to myself! . it seems that older tobii devices don't support this new sdk, and newer devices don't support the old one -- and i'm not sure whether there are any in the middle that support both. this sdk uses a callback which can cause problems in opensesame, see: https://github.com/smathot/opensesame/issues/545 the solution is probably to restrict what's done in the callback, rather than making changes to opensesame
