 URL : "https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-ruby/issues/19" TITLE : downloading profile photos BODY : per the get profile photo docs https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/api-reference/v1.0/api/profilephoto_get , it appears that getting photo meta data is supported by the sdk: e.g. graph.me.photo => get /me/photo but that getting the actual image is not supported. get /me/photo/$value. am i missing something, or is this a known issue?. thanks!
