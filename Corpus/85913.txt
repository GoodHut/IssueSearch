 URL : "https://github.com/CherryProjects/translate-maker/issues/12" TITLE : future of translate-maker BODY : hi zlatko, saw you put a lot of effort into this library...but wondering a little if there is a need for yet another i18n library don't get me wrong . coming from i18next https://github.com/i18next/i18next i know it's a lot of work and even harder to get an i18n library to be used. i18next primary has it's on json format to work on supports all the needs but even if adapted by some major translation management softwares - is not build on a standard . beside that we provide gettext format support via our converter module. i always thought about providing a icu compatible translate plugin - means the default translate module on the i18next json format could be exchangable with another module. so one could use the benefits of i18next language detection, backends and also choose to use the icu format. not sure if you would see benefit it joining that effort? if that's nothing you're interested just close this again... great to see what you've done so far and keep up. best, jan
