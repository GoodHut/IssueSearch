 URL : "https://github.com/gonum/gonum/issues/279" TITLE : documentation beyond godoc BODY : hi all. i was wondering if there was any thinking/planning to do more verbose documentation with various intended use-case examples than what godoc offers currently. one thing i find that really successful packages all have in common is lots of good usage documentation. i know gonum is meant to be similar to numpy for go, and as i recall while numpy's adoption was slow'ish at first, as more documentation was written, it really took off rapidly. anyway, i realize this is not an issue or an enhancement discussion, so if you feel it is inappropriate, for github issues, feel free to axe. thanks!
