 URL : "https://github.com/OpenAngelArena/oaa/issues/595" TITLE : mini rosh fixes BODY : a couple of points: 1. instead of getting smaller, which i feel was just a glitch that everyone found charming, maybe he should get like... 5-10% bigger each time the rooms get cleared? 2. rosh needs to have a max leash distance. 3. more?
