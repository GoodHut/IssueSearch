 URL : "https://github.com/mrihtar/Garmin-FIT/issues/7" TITLE : fitdump.pl: json output BODY : i'm trying to do some data analysis of .fit files and i love garmin::fit for helping me with this. but not being a perl developer by trade, it would be really slick if fitdump.pl had a --json option or some way to output the data as json. ideally, you'd output basically an array of objects and each object would correspond with the type of data it corresponds to. i will look into submitting a pr for this in the meantime but i figured i'd start here to get your opinion, and possibly save time by having an expert knock it out. thanks again for this awesome library.
