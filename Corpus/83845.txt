hi all, this issue, which i believe may have existed for a good while now, causes problems predominantly with our 'botanists a-z' vocabulary field when tagging content to appear on new and existing 'botanist a-z' taxon pages. given that we format botanist names using commas, we almost always enter names in this vocab field using quotes e.g. smith, j. . however, when entering a whole string of names where one or more already exist in our taxonomy, we're finding that if an existing name is searched and pulled into the field using the drop-down menu, all quotes for preceding names already entered into the field are removed. to avoid ending up with initials separated from surnames in the taxonomy, it becomes necessary to manually re-enter all quotes before saving or i must go into the taxonomy and tidy it up afterwards. furthermore, i have discovered that the same problem also seems to lead to occasional initials being removed from surnames already entered into the field but i haven't yet understood when or how this occurs. additionally, as a minor side issue, it is currently not possible to import an existing name into the field if the first few letters are typed with a preceding quote. e.g. entering < smi > will not show me that smith, j. is already available which can lead to duplicate entries. i hope there is a simple solution to some or all of this. any improvements that could be made would be really useful since i have often assumed other users were failing to use quotes as they should, but i now have a list of perhaps 45 incorrect names to sort out in the taxonomy which i created myself, by accident, this morning. thanks, kristina http://gpi.myspecies.info/
