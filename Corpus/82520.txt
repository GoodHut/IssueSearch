 URL : "https://github.com/thermo2016/SensirionSmartGadget/issues/1" TITLE : address type in btread.py BODY : hello, it seems that pygatt now uses a different convention for identifying the type of address a device uses e.g. public, random . the sample code in btread.py has device = adapter.connect macaddr,5,'random' but this no longer works and throws an error from the pygatt backend that a string does not have an attribute of name. this is because the string 'random' that is being passed should now look more like addrtype = pygatt.backends.bleaddresstype.random so now the connect call would look like device = adapter.connect macaddr, timeout, addrtype where timeout is the timeout value and macaddr is the address of the device. i've found this issue using ubuntu 16.04 lts and python 2.7
