 URL : "https://github.com/dvddarias/rdocker/issues/11" TITLE : tls record error BODY : i'm running rdocker.sh on ubuntu 16.04 under wsl. i'm running against an alpine linux 3.7 host. it seems to work in most cases, however when attempting to run an interactive command, i get the error tls: oversized record received with length 20527 . for example: docker:root@alpine ben@desktop-l06dush:~/rdocker$ docker run -it alpine ash tls: oversized record received with length 20527 whilst docker run alpine will complete successfully. any ideas?
