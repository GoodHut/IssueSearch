 URL : "https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/2625" TITLE : support for typing? BODY : i've been looking at applying typing to some code which uses pil/pillow. is there any feeling regarding the addition of type annotations within pillow, or if these belong outside the code in eg. typeshed? this influences whether i might work on a pr against pillow itself, or generate stubs for typeshed. on the basis of supporting python 2 and 3, i expect annotations would be in comments, and there would be an import of the typing module near the top, to define required types.
