 URL : "https://github.com/rmariano/vim-config/issues/21" TITLE : add new deploy option BODY : as the project currently has make dev-deploy for linking to the files for development, there should be a new target called make deploy that copies the files instead of creating symlinks override if they already exists; maybe give a warning . make install would get the files from the remote repository wget from github , so it only requires the makefile to be downloaded. on the other hand, makek deploy will assume the whole proyect is downloaded, and their required files will be copied to the respective target locations. update the documentation with this rationale, and include it in the installation examples ðŸ˜„
