 URL : "https://github.com/kangax/html-minifier/issues/824" TITLE : no longer works BODY : i updated to from 0.6.9 to 3.5.2 and the plugin no longer works. i'm getting the following error: minify is not defined. minify htmlcode, { removeattributequotes: false, collapsewhitespace: true, removecomments: true } ; i made sure the plugin is loading; and it is. so i'm guessing the issue is the plugin itself.
