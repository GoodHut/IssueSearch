 URL : "https://github.com/JeffreyBLewis/WebVoteView/issues/98" TITLE : heat map events BODY : votes with nominate cutlines now display a heat map showing probability of a yea vote. i have wired up a tooltip and an interactive legend in the prototype at http://leela.sscnet.ucla.edu/nomheat. probably most efficient to get a bit of @aaronrudkin 's attention to bring the legend and event handling into production. need to have some sort of event pass through to deal with the stack of svg objects that comprise the display. also, need to integrate some css from the prototype and to properly place the legend div.
