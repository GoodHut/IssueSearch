 URL : "https://github.com/prusa3d/Slic3r/issues/86" TITLE : wrongly sliced part BODY : version slic3r prusa edition 1.31.6 operating system type + version windows 8.1 behavior some parts are sliced wrongly. when trying to print part: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1933258 according to the instructions 1 layer thick, no bottom, no top layer the result of slicing with slic3r gives some extra material on some spots making columns raising from the part. please see the photo with comparison of a part sliced with slic3r and simplify3d. this is not a printer issue, nor a material issue; i tried on several similar 3d models and printing from pla, abs, petg, always with the same result. i checked the visualization in slicer to see if these columns would be noticeable in the preview, but they are not, i haven't gone through the g-code though. ! img_20170109_085545 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/24963685/21760184/7823b79e-d64a-11e6-9c3d-cfdaf4880bb7.jpg not a new feature. stl/config .zip where problem occurs stl file link above.
