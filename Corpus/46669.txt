 URL : "https://github.com/dcellucci/MiniMOJO/issues/8" TITLE : mmv3 sensor libraries BODY : the newest version of the minimojo control boards adds several critical sensors. 1. a high-side switch http://www.ti.com/product/tps2559 that controls the motor supply. as the input for this switch is only a logic signal, the library will likely be only a few lines of code. 2. a three-channel current sensor http://www.ti.com/product/ina3221 that provides current consumption information for each servo. 3. a battery monitor https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/power/battery-management/max17201.html that provides state of charge soc feedback. 4. an imu https://github.com/sparkfun/lsm9ds1_breakout that provides heading, orientation, and acceleration information. of these, only the imu has an established library that's already written.
