 URL : "https://github.com/tamw-wnet/PBS_Media_Manager_Client/issues/7" TITLE : improved error handling BODY : right now, when the api returns a 404 or really any other error while searching for assets the error response gets suppressed in get_child_assets $result_data = array ; $raw_result = $this->get_child_items_of_type $parent_id, $parent_type, 'asset', $queryargs ; foreach $raw_result as $result { // only include the right asset_types if !in_array $result 'attributes' 'object_type' , $asset_types { continue; } ... i thought about just adding a detection for the error key provided in get_request and having it return that element of the array at that point. but i realized that might have side effects to other code you might be using already, or cause other headaches i'm not thinking through, so i figured i'd stop and ask what your preferred approach to forwarding those errors would be? seems the two primary options would be to make sure error elements of the array bubble up to the caller or throw an exception at get_request and let it get caught and handled further up the stack. i don't mind either way but i'd like to be able to tell the difference between and empty response which i've seen the api provide when no data is found and a true error.
