 URL : "https://github.com/ULHPC/puppet-slurm/issues/2" TITLE : slurmdbd on sparate host BODY : it seems like in the current implementation of the module slurmdbd and slurmctld have to be on the same host. in particular, accountingstoragehost is set to the current control host in the slurm.conf . https://github.com/ulhpc/puppet-slurm/blob/c5782ed1e778e8e2b8833968903517af0e1b399e/templates/slurm.conf.erb l206 it seems that just using db host instead should fix the problem note that i didn't actually test that : accountingstoragehost=<%= scope 'slurm::slurmdbd::dbdhost' %> i don't know much about slurm yet, so correct me please if i'm missing something.
