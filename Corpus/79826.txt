 URL : "https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/issues/1543" TITLE : submitbutton with domain BODY : it would be incredibly useful to be able to have ui construct where the domain for a particular submit button could be specified, rather than have the submit button govern the whole page. for instance, you could do something like: fixedpage submitdomain sliderinput 'slider1', ... , submitbutton , submitdomain sliderinput 'slider2', ... , submitbutton in this case, the first submitbutton would only control the release of the inputs in the first submitdomain and the second submitbutton would only control the release of the input in the second domain.
