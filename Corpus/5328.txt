 URL : "https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/issues/1280" TITLE : new xml plugin BODY : as the current xml plugin is rather limited and fails to parse several valid xml files e.g. maven snippets when uploaded to the snippet sharing it is a good idea to replace it with a more robust implementation. to avoid carrying over problems of the old xmltoolkit codebase, we'd recreate it from scratch. i guess this plugin should aim to be as general as possible? the xml elements can probably be translated to an elektra hierarchy like <test> <element1 attr1= test /> <element2> <element3>text</element3> </element2> </test> is /test/element1/attr1 = test // store as metadata /test/element2/element3 = text a quick research on c xml libraries showed the following possibilities: - libxml2 http://www.xmlsoft.org/examples/index.html - seems to support a variety of systems - actively maintained and backed by the gnome project - no dependencies, just ansi c - mit licence - expat http://expat.sourceforge.net/ - also seems to support a lot of systems - also seems to be actively maintained - no information wheter its ansi c found yet but apparently also used by some known oss projects like apache webserver or mozilla - mit licence - mini xml http://www.msweet.org/projects.php?z3 - also seems to be actively maintained - only ansi c needed, thus also works on a variety of systems - lgpl licence i estimate a few hours to develop a simple version e.g. 5-10, given i have no plugin experience yet. this should solve the following related issues: - 1159 - 1228 so what do you think about which xml library to use? and do you agree with the requirements?
