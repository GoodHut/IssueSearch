 URL : "https://github.com/rupertgermann/tt_news/issues/55" TITLE : cannot set moduletemplate BODY : is it possible to remove the logging in the backend module tx_ttnews_module1::main when the template can't be found or at least lower the severity? this message floods our devlog and seems to be uncritical as the template is fetched with a fallback anyways. or is there something else i can do to make those messages disappear? seems like the problem is the symlink from typo3_src/typo3 to typo3 in the webroot but this can't/shouldn't be changed.
