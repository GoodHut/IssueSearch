 URL : "https://github.com/feelpp/feelpp/issues/1104" TITLE : update log directory BODY : i had a problem with containers and feelpp_mesh_partionner regarding logs. as the partionner has no app names, it saves log in current directory ./logs, but that can be a problem regarding immutable containers read access . we should update this directory to be the working directory. or maybe add a feelpp_logdir in the case there's no appname.
