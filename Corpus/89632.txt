 URL : "https://github.com/stanfordnlp/GloVe/issues/56" TITLE : readme guidelines vs code BODY : the readme file says to concatenate documents with a single space or dummy words, yet i see there is a code branch in glove.c for processing newlines. after trying both dummy words and newlines i've got almost the same results. also, for dummy words, shouldn't we use as many as the window size?
