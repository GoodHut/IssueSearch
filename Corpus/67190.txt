 URL : "https://github.com/k-next/starterkit/issues/26" TITLE : panel: messeges missing BODY : i'm not sure how it's intended to work but on many places i get a message that something is done successfully, which is nice. in the user view when i upload a picture for example, i don't get the message the picture was successfully uploaded . i was waiting for it, but it did not appear. would it be good to have a message like that? there are more places, i think, where a message does not appear.
