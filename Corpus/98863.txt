 URL : "https://github.com/mousebird/WhirlyGlobe/issues/876" TITLE : link warnings with library BODY : we're seeing a bunch of link warnings in the build server version. i'd like to get rid of these. perhaps we should just turn off -gmodules for release? /users/allen/gisbiz/apps/petunia/../../lib/maply/whirlyglobemaplycomponent.framework/whirlyglobemaplycomponent ddxmldocument.o : warning: /users/jenkins/library/developer/xcode/deriveddata/modulecache/16mjqpulaxfhv/foundation-a3sod99kj0s9.pcm: no such file or directory note: linking a static library that was built with -gmodules, but the module cache was not found. redistributable static libraries should never be built with module debugging enabled. the debug experience will be degraded due to incomplete debug information.
