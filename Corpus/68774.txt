 URL : "https://github.com/akonwi/git-plus/issues/621" TITLE : should output git error BODY : hi, when i execute a git plus action menu, if there is a git error, the menu is stuck there forever. for e.g, i run a push to an self-signed ssl site, which would fail. to know the error, i have to go back to the terminal to review it. so i think it is better that git plus output the error so user know how to fix it. thank you,
