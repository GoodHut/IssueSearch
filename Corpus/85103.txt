 URL : "https://github.com/africanmathsinitiative/R-Instat/issues/4110" TITLE : entering na into the grid BODY : we had to replace a single value in the grid by na. this was the rainfall total in a year, and the number of rain days, where all was missing. it would not have calculated the mean, but the total for that year was zero. it looked as though typing na is not allowed. it said the column was numeric or integer. i think mwhat is happening is that it is <space>na. can we remove spaces at the start of an entry, at least in non-character columns - perhaps in all? i have said this is a bug. it is close if not.
