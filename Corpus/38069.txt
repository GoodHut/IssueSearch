 URL : "https://github.com/pelya/libiconv-libicu-android/issues/4" TITLE : no support for arm64 BODY : with the growth of arm64/aarch64 devices, people need to be able to build these libraries for those architectures as well. i made a cross tools script https://github.com/pelya/libiconv-libicu-android/files/908487/setcrossenvironment-arm64-v8a.sh.zip that works for me for arm64, but it is not 100% tested and working.
