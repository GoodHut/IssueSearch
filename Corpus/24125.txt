 URL : "https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/issues/2670" TITLE : sendmail in docker BODY : trying to configure emails with the docker setup. i have a local smtp server. i get a relay access denied error when trying to use smtp, and sendmail attempts to connect to 127.0.0.1 and gets a connection refused error, because i'm guessing there's no mail server living inside the docker container for sidekiq. should i point smtp at the docker bridge? would that appear to be local traffic for the smtp instance, and get around the relay issue? is there some configuration setting for telling sendmail which ip address to point to? i suppose some more documentation about handling email within a docker setup would be helpful. - x i searched or browsed the repoâ€™s other issues to ensure this is not a duplicate. - x this bug happens on a tagged release https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/releases and not on master if you're a user, don't worry about this .
