 URL : "https://github.com/calband/calchart-redesign/issues/186" TITLE : runasync with web workers BODY : neither settimeout nor promise objects are actually multi-threaded. use web workers to actually run asynchronously need to create a good framework for this. maybe a workers/ directory in src/ that define functions? maybe use this https://stackoverflow.com/a/10136565/4966649 to wrap entry javascript files to contain worker code. like // editor.js import { workerfunc } from utils ; exports.workers = { foo: workerfunc, }; // the usual stuff like editorcontroller.init ... // show.js runasync foo , data => { // callback for data returned by workerfunc } ; // compiled editor.js function global { // code from stack overflow msgworker e { switch e.name { case foo : workerfunc ; } } msgparent e { callback e.data ; } } this ;
