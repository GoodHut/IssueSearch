 URL : "https://github.com/gopacifia/DEEP/issues/34" TITLE : admin app / user app BODY : i had a look at the work app on testocp. it is a great way to have a clean interface for the user, and i guess more functions can be added to the user ux according to his/her needs right? right now in the work app, the inventory page shows only my resources but doesn't show the network-shared inventory or let say the catalogue . that would be needed in deep work app. the focus of ocp is collaborative work, so the work app focuses on tasks and projects. but the focus of deep in the first stages would be exchanges so the user app should focus on the catalogue/inventory, adding new resources and manage own inventory, and performing exchanges. i can envision two modules for the user: the work app and the exchange app. exchange app is available by default and work app wich contains recipes, production process, tasks is ptional. the user can go into to settings and select enable work app .
