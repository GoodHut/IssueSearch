 URL : "https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctorj-pdf/issues/13" TITLE : built-in fonts aren't used BODY : it appears that built-in fonts aren't used when specifying a custom theme. not sure whether this is an issue with the maven plugin or with asciidoctorj-pdf or somewhere else. from my reading of the theming guide https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf/blob/master/docs/theming-guide.adoc fonts it seems to me if i'm not overriding the built in font catalog & not specifying a pdffontdir, the bundled fonts ought to be used. however, this doesn't seem to work. for example the maven plugin example https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-maven-examples/tree/master/asciidoctor-pdf-with-theme-example has this problem though i didn't realize it initially until i modified the sample document and started getting the following text could not be fully converted to the windows-1252 character set warnings.
