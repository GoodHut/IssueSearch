 URL : "https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop/issues/12125" TITLE : add wallabagger extension BODY : was not able to find any mention of wallabag in the extension requests or issues. description this extension adds urls to a wallabag account for read-later type functionality similar to pocket . the difference is that wallabag can be self-hosted, and in my mind anyways probably appeals more to the brave user base than a freemium service. you can also annotate articles and have them read aloud to you, both of which are quite handy. the chrome wallabagger extension can be found here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wallabagger/gbmgphmejlcoihgedabhgjdkcahacjlj the firefox wallabagger extension can be found here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/wallabagger/
