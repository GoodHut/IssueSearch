 URL : "https://github.com/mithi/hexy/issues/3" TITLE : add asymmetric parameter BODY : first of all a big thanks to @mithi for this great code i do have a different type of hexapod and the servo configuration makes the left and right side asymmetric, so +10 deg on left side makes -10 deg on right side. not being a programmer i would kindly request that you consider implementing this new parameter symetry class ? so we can expand to a larger hexapod compatibility. here is a picture of the ''monster'': ! img_0997 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12484190/24985613/5b1e993a-1fc3-11e7-92d1-c0695d3b6d6a.jpg
