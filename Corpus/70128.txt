 URL : "https://github.com/Polymer/hn-polymer-2/issues/14" TITLE : upgrade to polymer 3.0? BODY : polymer 3.0 hasn't reached its production release yet, allegedly https://www.polymer-project.org/blog/2017-08-23-hands-on-30-preview still missing support for prpl, though that seems not in use yet here see 9 . what would be the blockers for this repo to upgrade to 3.0? afaik component libs may need to upgrade as well, but i'll gladly defer a better answer to those with more knowledge of polymer.
