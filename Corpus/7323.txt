 URL : "https://github.com/MaartenBaert/ssr/issues/577" TITLE : file/save as is BODY : the file/save as tooltip says the recording will be saved to this location it is unclear i kept getting this error muxer::init error: can't open output file! i erased my ~/.ssr config directory and was not able to restore defaults. that location was still blank. eventually, i was able to use test_simplescreenrecorder.mkv 1. suggestion is to update the tooltip to add an example like so: the recording will be saved to this location. eg. test_simplescreenrecorder.mkv 2. when the ~/.ssr directory is deleted. to reset the defaults when it is not found, instead of only at first run not sure how this is identified
