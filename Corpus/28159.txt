 URL : "https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/2235" TITLE : file revision names BODY : file revision names are based on the first file revision name i.e. this is what is per default provided for the further revisions. the other file revisions could however have a different format: for example the first file could be a .doc but the next revision of the file could be a .pdf . the next revision would per default provide the name with .doc . this can still be edited, but maybe it would be however better to base the name on the current file name? this is especially important in the migration of the revisions from ojs 2.4.x, because there, the file revision name is as the first file name. in this case if someone would like to download the file revision the user will see .doc , but actually it will be a .pdf document. s. discussion here: https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/2097
