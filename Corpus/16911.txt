 URL : "https://github.com/FluidTYPO3/vhs/issues/1312" TITLE : minify css and js BODY : hello am i missing something in the documentation or is css/js minification really not supported? based on this older closed issue, seems like it is the case: https://github.com/fluidtypo3/vhs/issues/546 typoscript's _config.compressjs_ and _config.compresscss_ do nothing as i assume they only touch the assets included using typoscript.
