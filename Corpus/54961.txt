 URL : "https://github.com/udacity/robotics-beta-test-issues/issues/582" TITLE : hyperlinks not working BODY : the links in the lessons to other parts of the course are not working for me.
e.g. this link https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd209/parts/586e8e81-fc68-4f71-9cab-98ccd4766cfe/modules/e5bfcfbd-3f7d-43fe-8248-0c65d910345a/lessons/2cc29bbd-5c51-4c3e-b238-1282e4f24f42/concepts/57f2601e-7f58-4873-aead-70ba96da270f appears in the last project, perception pipeline section. when i try to follow it, the following message pops up: you are not allowed to access this nanodegree program. is your subscription paused, or past due? this is happening in every lesson, i tested it trying to access to links in previous sections that were working before.
