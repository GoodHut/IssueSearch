 URL : "https://github.com/dpi/smsframework/issues/68" TITLE : e164 validator project BODY : separate project to sms framework problem currently sms framework will accept any string for use as a phone number. some gateways may want to ensure they only receive a valid e164. technical project depends on libphonenumber gateways wishing to opt in to this functionality, would need to depend on this new project at a module level. gateways requiring this feature would specify in a new requires_e164 or similar gateway annotation. the annotation would be boolean. true to opt in. module operation in the processing phase of an outgoing message, the validator will attempt to coerce the phone number into e164. local phone numbers will attempt to be transformed into international e164 using site level, and if available target entity, why separate module sms framework does not require composer. this module would require it. this module would be pretty slim, mainly using functions from libphonenumber, and using sms framework api's/events to bind everything together
