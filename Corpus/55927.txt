 URL : "https://github.com/scidash/neuronunit/issues/119" TITLE : mac issues with neuron BODY : i have nailed the segmentation fault issue on the mac down to the fact that: import lems_2007one_nrn runs fine, but: python def foo : import lems_2007one_nrn foo produces the segmentation fault. of course both of these work fine in linux or docker. i am going to post the issue in the neuron forums. i think the problem is that whatever things are getting loaded in the auto-generated neuron python files are not getting disposed of properly in the c code on the mac. when imported normally they are still in memory, but when imported inside a function the pointers aren't getting disposed of when the function exits, and then memory issues occur leading to a segmentation fault.
