 URL : "https://github.com/airbnb/streamalert/issues/503" TITLE : feature support guardduty BODY : amazon just announced a new security service named guardduty this week. https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/ it has some useful rules that would be difficult to implement in streamalert, such as detecting logins from new asns, which requires correlation with past events. when guardduty detects something, it writes to cloudwatch events. my request is: 1. support the schema used by guardduty alerts. 2. create a streamalert rule to alert on any guardduty alerts. from the user guide p 44, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty-ug.pdf , the format of the cloudwatch events is: { version : 0 , id : cd2d702e-ab31-411b-9344-793ce56b1bc7 , detail-type : guardduty finding , source : aws.guardduty , account : 111122223333 , time : 1970-01-01t00:00:00z , region : us-east-1 , resources : , detail : {complete_guardduty_finding_json} }
