 URL : "https://github.com/BoPeng/simuPOP/issues/34" TITLE : tracking birth experience BODY : hello everyone, i'm trying to simulate a population in overlapping generation, in which females can have offsprings only if they didn't have offsprings in the previous year. males can have offsprings any time. although i thought that offspring_idx could be helpful, the index is reset for each mating event. is there any way to track whether an individual had offsprings in the previous year or not? any help would be appreciated. best regards, ito
