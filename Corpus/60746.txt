 URL : "https://github.com/vega/vega/issues/912" TITLE : add dynamic data loader BODY : investigate addition of a new transform operator that performs data file loading with support for the following features: - dynamic parameterization by signals, causing data refresh - periodic polling to pull data updates perhaps via a new timer signal? - observable support to push data updates 893 this operator could be used to handle loading/parsing for data set definitions, replacing the hard-wired data loading / pending support currently used in vega-dataflow.
