 URL : "https://github.com/FABtotum/fabui-colibri/issues/171" TITLE : restore does not work BODY : when trying to update to 1.0 the machine gets stuck on the yellow lights, however strangely fabui can still be accessed with the yellow lights flashing. i attempted to use recovery mode saving no data but this had no effect so i tired to keep only the user settings, however this would not allow me to finish the process. there are two php errors at the top of the screen array_merge : argument 2 is not an array and invalid argument supplied for foreach i go through the steps but i get stuck after 3 when the next button does not do anything i think i will try a fresh system next and will update with the results of that.
