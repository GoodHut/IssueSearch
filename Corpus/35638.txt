BODY : i had this error screen on the second start-up of the tool. after a comment from fitzzz thanks! it turned out that i had misunderstood the settings for the directories. they should not point to where dcs is installed but where the saved games directories are. all seems ok now. answer errorscreen.txt https://github.com/thefitzzz/dcs-config-manager/files/1445300/answer.errorscreen.txt ! errorscreen https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25878546/32429292-373ded86-c2ca-11e7-9ace-6b7e7a438c25.png
