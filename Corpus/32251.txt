 URL : "https://github.com/agareis/LixDemoPlainJS/issues/7" TITLE : unit tests for node BODY : task: create one or more unit-tests for your server code details: - understand what mocha https://mochajs.org/ and chai are for - modularize the server code in a way that you can test the lix computation without having to deal with the server request/response logic you don't need to write tests for the http server, only for the lix logic - hint for the modularization: understand the express.js concept of middleware http://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html bonus: use test-driven development approach write a test before you actually write business logic code
