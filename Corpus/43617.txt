 URL : "https://github.com/joan2937/pigpio/issues/155" TITLE : custom function usage BODY : how are custom function implemented? are they inserted into the c library by editing the pigpio.c file then rebuilding, or is there something else i'm missing? are there examples of usages for custom functions? <anyone, please comment> is a custom function a good way to introduce a new feature or a bug fix? i have a need to customize an existing function to add a feature. i make a function that is a near duplicate of an existing function but with my new feature or potentially a bug fix . i share the custom function somehow with other pigpio users. once we are all happy with the custom function we request that joan includes it in the next release. which leads finally to my last question: how can the users share custom functions? my quick thoughts on this are that the wiki in this repo would be an excellent place to list what is available and where to find them on github. <please comment>
