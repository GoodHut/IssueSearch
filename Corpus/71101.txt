 URL : "https://github.com/electricimp/Builder/issues/36" TITLE : @include path uniqueness BODY : the following paths are all considered unique: @include once /a/path/to/a/file.nut @include once a/path/to/a/file.nut @include once ./a/path/to/a/file.nut i believe builder automatically references all @include 's to the root of the project, so these should all be considered the same -- as it stands today, 3 copies of the file will be included in the resultant build.
