 URL : "https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/66" TITLE : srm analysis wiki BODY : planning on updating this page https://github.com/sr320/labdocs/wiki/srm-data-analyses in the old labdocs repo. @kubu4 / @sr320 is there anywhere else i should write this instead, or should i just update this page and worry about moving it over to the new resources repo later?
