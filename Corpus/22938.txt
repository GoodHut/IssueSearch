 URL : "https://github.com/vert-x3/issues/issues/306" TITLE : native memory leak BODY : we are using vertx 4.4.2 that uses netty 4.1.8 we experienced native memory leaks in vertx that cause the process memory footprint to grow to several giga bytes beyond the usual. after long investigation we found that netty is allocation native memory buffer which cause the leak. the only way to limit netty is by adding -xx:maxdirectmemorysize argument to the application startup script. this worked for sometime but when using vertx api vertx.filesystem .readfile which create vertx buffer we got null buffer. vertx buffer is a wrapper around netty bytebuf which probably means that netty was unable to allocate buffer. i would be gratefully if anyone can help with that. maybe the new vertx version 3.5 can solve this but didn't try it yet.
