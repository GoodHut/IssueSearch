 URL : "https://github.com/tarsqi/ttk/issues/51" TITLE : add source checking BODY : it happens too often that you run a pipeline and give the wrong value of --source , typically by running over a ttk file and then forgetting to use --source=ttk , in which case the xml default is used and your results can be puzzling. add some checking where the code checks whether what we have really is xml or ttk .
