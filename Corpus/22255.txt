 URL : "https://github.com/cyanisaac/Brightify/issues/1" TITLE : ipad not supported BODY : ipad is not supported. the reason for this is that the tweak looks for the iphone color key in spotify's theme.plist @ and therefore doesn't look for ipad. this could be fixed by adding code that runs for ipads but not iphones. i'm not able to test if this works or not, however, as i don't own an ipad let alone a jailbreakable one.
