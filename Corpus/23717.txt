 URL : "https://github.com/bgp/draft-grow-bgp-session-culling/issues/11" TITLE : real life examples BODY : how many examples should we include, and which ones should we include? current set of examples is nicely diverse, but sr-os for instance is not commonly used at ixps. i don't think it'll be good to include each and every platform on the planet, i suggest we select 3 - but which 3?
