 URL : "https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django/issues/55" TITLE : csrf on login BODY : the login urls login/<service>/ are not using csrf protection, thus it's possible to authenticate users by following links from third party sites. it can be simply fixed by adding @require_post decorator on social_django.views.auth, but that will require all users to change their logins to use post instead of get which it needed so far, so i'm not sure this is good change by default. maybe having this as opt-it? anyway i've applied the decorator in urls for our case: https://github.com/weblateorg/weblate/commit/bfd2988e519d43b478987d204f20b53c4932b4a1 diff-926cd04e84cfd0cbeab80af203e8f6d0r36
