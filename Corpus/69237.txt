 URL : "https://github.com/sul-dlss/argo/issues/921" TITLE : support exlucion facets BODY : this is an enhancement that has broad potential value across faceted queries, so our hope is that it might emerge in blacklight so that argo could simply take advantage of it. this ticket is to record our interest in such a feature. use case â€“ sometime multiple data values overlap across records. normal facets allow you to find those items in a category with a value, but not those that lack a value. example, for the object type facet: object type collection 586 x set 406 since every collection should be a set, but not every set will be a collection, the second number should be higher than the first. it would be useful to be able to exclude the 406 to find which ones are missing the set relationship. even the simpler case of, say, excluding object-type=collection or content-type=book after a keyword search would be valuable. the facility would be potentially useful in any facet that is multi-valued in source records. from https://jirasul.stanford.edu/jira/browse/argo-320
