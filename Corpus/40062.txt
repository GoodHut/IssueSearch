 URL : "https://github.com/RedHatSatellite/sat6_disconnected_tools/issues/18" TITLE : task_id not provided BODY : not really an issue, but i have been looking at your code and if there are other sync processes running on the satellite when exporting, it will fail first withe the warning of incomplete syn jobs detected, later will fail saying unable to start export - sync in progress but will be helpful if the script can spit out the task id that is preventing the export to run. sometimes the satellite it gives the whole url for the task, in that way someone can go see it and unlock/stop it and the export job can be ran again
