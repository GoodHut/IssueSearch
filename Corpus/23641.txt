 URL : "https://github.com/wtay/pipewire/issues/2" TITLE : qemu audio support BODY : when ready, pipewire will be able to use the current pulseaudio support in qemu right? would that support potentially benefit from the low latency support that pipewire aims to achieve, or would that require qemu to support pipewire directly? there are many users that experience clicking and pops when redirecting audio output from a vm to the host audio system. i'm not sure how much work is involved to provide pipewire as another audio driver for qemu but if it could fix that, it would be amazing. another area lacking in qemu audio at least with pulseaudio seems to be greater than stereo channel support, i'm not sure if there is a limitation caused there. i understand this would be a rather low priority request, i just figure you'd have the knowledge/ability to potentially add the support at a later date once pipewire is meeting it's core development goals well.
