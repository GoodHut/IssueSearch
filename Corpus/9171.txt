 URL : "https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/issues/2213" TITLE : touch_up signal BODY : i suggest you add a touch_up signal or similar; it's very useful for uis. without it i can't know wether the user is holding the mouse button or has already released it, so it might be released before a drag event for drag 'n drops , plus it looks weird when a button is released but you didn't release the mouse button.
