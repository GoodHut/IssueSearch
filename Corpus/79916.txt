 URL : "https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-cli/issues/9" TITLE : support for auth headers BODY : it would be great if graphql-cli would always use the explicit endpointextension config format and not the url-string one, and also asked for additional information like auth headers during graphql init. > when i try to run graphql ping i get this error message, which means that of course my authentication header is missing. > > unfortunately i didn’t think about looking through the graphql-config spec, so i delved into the code of graphql-cli and then graphql-config, looking for a place to add header information. > i found the code that treated the “endpoints” entries, either as url if they are a string, or as “endpointextension” object otherwise, which then can also contain other information, like headers. > so i changed the entry manually into a json object and added my auth header information.
