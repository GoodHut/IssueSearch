 URL : "https://github.com/kwsch/PKHeX/issues/1167" TITLE : bug with selecting BODY : when ever selecting an alolan form like alolan raichu, pkhex selects it as a normal raichu. i have to wait a second or two before re selecting it for the alolan form to show as selected. hope that made sense. as you can see from the thumbnail, it's an alolan raichu but initial selection selects it as a normal/illegal raichu ! image https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18354599/26522481/8d5d29fc-42dc-11e7-9220-7c670e3a4978.png
