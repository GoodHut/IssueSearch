 URL : "https://github.com/Darkosto/SevTech-Ages/issues/352" TITLE : mob drops in nei/jei BODY : not sure if versions of the mod support this yet but if possible can we get a mob drop tab like a lot of the 1.10 packs had? one example of usefulness early on, i didn't realize shearing sheep dropped fleece so i never tried cause the only recipe that showed was wool -> fleece in mill stone which i couldn't use yet.
