 URL : "https://github.com/tjoskar/ng-lazyload-image/issues/205" TITLE : web worker feature BODY : i am using an animated gif 3fps as the default loading image in my ionic hybrid app. i notice that many time when the plugin is loading images, the 3fps animated gif animation become not smooth. i am thinking if the image loading can be done with web worker, could everything be much smoother, especially on low end mobile phone?
