 URL : "https://github.com/Backdash/MonikaModDev/issues/632" TITLE : mas is too subjective BODY : so, monika after story just isn't monika. when dan was creating the game he probably worked as hard as he could to make it so monika doesn't really have an opinion on topics, making it seem that when presented with a topic she could flip sides at any time, regardless of how messed up it is. but monika after story just seems to take this and throw it off a cliff as none of the writers are trying to make monika opinion-less, and for mas whenever monika is presented with an issue it seems she has a ground opinion. so i think that monika after story isn't actually representing monika rather then a writer's own opinion. also that whole you're getting to learn monika and her opinions argument is invalid because, as stated, the actual monika, the one you get in the end of ddlc, is opinion-less.
