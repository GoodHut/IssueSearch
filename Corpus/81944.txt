 URL : "https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/issues/2766" TITLE : add a boot-finished event BODY : hello, the more you advance on the customization of tiddlywiki, and usage of tiddlywiki as a framework the more you dig into the boot process and the startup modules. i think it would be super-useful to have an event that tells you when tiddlywiki has finished booting, so you can start your magical stuff once boot has finished. taking in account that tiddlywiki handles the entire boot process, calling all the startup modules and rendering the ui after that it should be fairly easy to trigger such event. thanks in advance.
