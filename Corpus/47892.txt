BODY : hi @jennybc the link to launch r graph catalog doesn't appear to be working anymore. i believe i remembered you showing this during stat 545 and i was hoping to show it to a grad module i'm teaching at ubc in september biol 548l so they can quickly get a glimpse of a whole bunch of different charts + code. am i just missing something? thanks! melissa
