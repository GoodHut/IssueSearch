 URL : "https://github.com/NBISweden/LocalEGA/issues/58" TITLE : file naming in the vault BODY : agree with central ega about the procedure to settle the ingested file names. when the re-encrypted file is in the staging area and about to leave for the vault, a name is decided, fixed and recorded in the database. we suggest that central ega creates an rest endpoint that we hit in order to get a file name. therefore, they will know the names, in general, and we use those ones internally.
