 URL : "https://github.com/rubyforgood/habitat_humanity/issues/134" TITLE : give friendlier feedback BODY : if i try to sign in but don't include an email, all i see is check in not valid at the top. it would help to highlight the email field in red and/or give a more descriptive error message. if i try to sign in but don't enter a signature, the field is highlighted in red and the form isn't submitted. it would be nice to give an explanation as well e.g. put required near the box .
