 URL : "https://github.com/stanfordnmbl/osim-rl/issues/13" TITLE : how to generate a video? BODY : we are trying the code on ubuntu, and we managed to generate videos for gym games like cartpole and atari games by run 'xvfb-run' because the display is based on xvnc . we used monitor wrapper to generate videos, but in the 'osim.py': metadata = { 'render.modes': 'human' , 'video.frames_per_second': 50 } however, 'video_recorder' requires render.modes to be 'rgb_array' or â€˜ansi'. does anyone know how to generate a video? thx
