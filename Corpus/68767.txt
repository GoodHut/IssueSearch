 URL : "https://github.com/CommandPost/CommandPost/issues/447" TITLE : shortcut for text tools BODY : it would be handy to have some shortcuts which allow you to quickly change the case of selected text. for example, today i need to quickly change the case of a bunch of text in final cut pro, so i just threw together: hs.hotkey.bind { cmd , alt , ctrl }, q , function hs.eventtap.keystroke { command }, c local pasteboard = string.lower hs.pasteboard.getcontents hs.pasteboard.setcontents pasteboard hs.eventtap.keystroke { command }, v end
