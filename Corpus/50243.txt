 URL : "https://github.com/James-Yu/Atom-LaTeX/issues/13" TITLE : why so many releases? BODY : first of all, thanks for this package; it eased my life. with that being said, here's my question: why so many frequent releases? i had to update atom-latex many times just this week. frequent releases may be good, as it shows the package is not dead and is maintained, but it is annoying &mdash; at least, for me &mdash; have to update the package once every two days, more or less. isn't it more convenient to make a trace of all bug fixed, minor and major changes, putting it into readme maybe, and prepare new releases in a larger gap in between, say two, three weeks? regards, emerson
