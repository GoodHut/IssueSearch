 URL : "https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslViewer/issues/52" TITLE : pixel density issues BODY : in getpixeldensity , we are performing an integer division instead of a floating point division, but returning a float. the devicepixelratio might not be an integer! android phones often have dprs of 1.5 according to https://www.html5rocks.com/en/mobile/high-dpi/. and this page discusses non-integer pixel scaling ratios on linux: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1214470. when a window is dragged to another monitor with a different pixel density, we should recompute the cached pixel density. this could be done using glfwsetwindowposcallback.
