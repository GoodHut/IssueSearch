 URL : "https://github.com/flutter/flutter-intellij/issues/1215" TITLE : reload on save feedback BODY : an open-ended issue to track some ideas for iterating on the hot reload on save feature: - we shouldn't reload if there are analysis issues we need to figure out a way to tie into the analysis server here, in a way w/ a little potential for race conditions as possible - we should provide good feedback on every explicit user save so the user knows we're monitoring the save action properly - sample: hot reload was not performed, because there was no file change from last hot reload.
