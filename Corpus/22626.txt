 URL : "https://github.com/jeffbourdier/scwal/issues/1" TITLE : make file optional BODY : the 3rd command line argument, file , should be optional. if not specified, the first page should prompt the user to select one or create a new one . currently, if no value for file is specified, a null pointer is passed to sqlite3_exec http://sqlite.org/c3ref/exec.html , which results in sqlite3_exec returning an error, but the 5th parameter errmsg is not initialized. consequently, the following line fails: m = strlen pf + strlen s_sqlerr + strlen z ; where z = errmsg undefined, in this case, which usually results in a crash .
