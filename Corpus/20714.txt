 URL : "https://github.com/JosephLenton/fortress/issues/2" TITLE : create input layer BODY : there are several approaches to handling input. given how basic the input will probably be, i think having a single input layer is best. listens to user input decides what to call based on user input handles where commands should go based on current focus i don't think this should handle the current focus, but it should be aware of what has got focus.
