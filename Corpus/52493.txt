 URL : "https://github.com/kryptxy/torrench/issues/28" TITLE : command line arguments BODY : as per 25, it was suggested that perhaps there would be a better way to organize and handle the command line arguments used in torrench. this issue will be used to track the discussion. https://github.com/kryptxy/torrench/issues/25 issuecomment-331900687 suggested the use of docopt and click . personally, i have found click easier to use and simpler to read. are there any better alternatives? also, perhaps we could also consider a re-factorization of the code, instead of changing the module used to parse the cli arguments.
