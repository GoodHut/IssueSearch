 URL : "https://github.com/kislyuk/ensure/issues/22" TITLE : return boolean values? BODY : hey, i've been using ensure as contracts for functions, but it's pretty tricky due to the varying nature of return values. can we have an option in the ensure constructor to return a simple boolean true/false value? or, and i think this is a much better solution because it allows for chaining, simply implement __bool__ for all values returned by predicates to return the actual pass/fail status.
