 URL : "https://github.com/siddharthkp/bundlesize/issues/29" TITLE : become a github tool BODY : i would love to use this as a tool for all most of my repositories even the ones that are not written in js. would it be possible to transform this tool into something that would appear here https://github.com/marketplace similar to the travis ci for codacy. for example i would love to use this to get updates on bundlesize in a repository with shell scripts but don't want to add node modules to the project just to accomplish this.
