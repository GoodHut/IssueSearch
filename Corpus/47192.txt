 URL : "https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/nwb-schema/issues/54" TITLE : nwbfile -> nwbsession BODY : moving here from https://github.com/neurodatawithoutborders/pynwb/issues/106 since this is a schema issue. the refactoring of the nwb infrastructure has brought a much-needed separation of the concerns of the api, schema, and backend. in particular, the schema is now ostensibly agnostic to the specifics of the backend implementation. practically, the only supported backend is hdf5 via the hdf5io object in the form.backends.hdf5 module, however this can now be replaces with e.g. a database of filestore backend. despite this, the schema maintains the now-archaic file semantics. i propose that we rename nwbfile to be nwbsession or nwbexperiment or nwbdataset & update descriptions of various attributes that reference the nwb file accordingly.
