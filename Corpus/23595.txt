 URL : "https://github.com/samanyougarg/ABR-App-Backup-Restore/issues/2" TITLE : publish in f-droid BODY : first of all: wow! abr looks wonderful! üòç would it be possible to publish it directly on f-droid https://f-droid.org/packages/ though? ps: i saw that izzysoft asked https://github.com/samanyougarg/abr-app-backup-restore/issues/1 simply to push the release to easily promote his repository but having it available to all users who uses f-droid makes probably much more sense.
