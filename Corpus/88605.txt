 URL : "https://github.com/tridentli/pitchfork/issues/126" TITLE : notifications for changes BODY : users currently do not get easy insight into what changed to their account. users should receive email for instance when they get approved to a group and optionally, ability to disable that notification tbd but this notification should also be listed in their userhome so that when they go there they can see 'hey that changed, awesome'.
