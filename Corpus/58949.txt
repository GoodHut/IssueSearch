 URL : "https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/issues/1732" TITLE : support tree rewriting BODY : while the focus of antlr4 is unfortunately no longer for compiler/interpreter/transpiler writers, i use it for a transpiler anyway. antlr4 is so much nicer grammar-wise than antlr3. however, the lack of tree rewriting/mutation is driving me crazy. this is for special cases, of course, but when you do need it say, for normalization , you end up doing ugly duplication on a side-ast. all i really need is mutators on the generated vector/string fields this is the c++ backend . i can't even call settext now. anyway. frustrated. any plans for tree mutation?
