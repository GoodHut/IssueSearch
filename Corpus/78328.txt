 URL : "https://github.com/app-registry/appr/issues/93" TITLE : private packages support BODY : private packages are supported by quay but not in the app registry open source version . this is a feature request, that has been discussed in some forums and that i want to document, to add support for private packages. i believe this will require some form of auth and association of users and groups to repos.
