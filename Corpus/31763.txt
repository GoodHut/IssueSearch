 URL : "https://github.com/openbadges/badgecheck/issues/133" TITLE : support for python3 BODY : as a user/consumer, i would like to have support for python3. this way, those of us with python3 environments can use it without needing to set up a new environment with the older python2.7. it could also allow us to 'just plug it in' to our application and use it. this can be especially useful for hosted environments where the python versions available to us may be limited.
