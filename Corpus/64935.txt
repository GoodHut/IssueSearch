 URL : "https://github.com/alecmuffett/eotk/issues/3" TITLE : http public key pinning BODY : i set it up last night and experimented using a domain name i control. i implement @ietf rfc 7469 to stipulate specific x.509 credentials in @apache on all the domain names i control. @thetorproject client doesn't connect to the clear-text host-name through the @thetorproject domain name because the self-signed x.509 credential set up for the @thetorproject domain name suffix doesn't match. it also affects @ietf rfc 6797 if the x.509 credential for the clear-text host-name is preloaded in @thetorproject client. it therefore stops connecting to the clear-text host-name because of the subsequent mismatch. i'd suggest adding the secure hash algorithm 2 output for @thetorproject domain name to the stipulated x.509 credentials @apache but it's not going to fix it because the self-signed x.509 credential itself is untrusted. i realize that the configuration i use is uncommon but it is a useful practical demonstration of the benefit and robustness of @ietf rfc 7469 and @ietf rfc 6797! @ietf rfc 7469 is a useful mechanism but i feel it also might be detrimental because it could permit identification of a clear-text host-name if it's being used to host both clear-text material and material through @thetorproject and the secure hash algorithm 2 output is identified through comparing a database of clear-text domain names and their subsequent secure hash algorithm 2 output.
