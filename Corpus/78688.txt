 URL : "https://github.com/ucb-bar/project-template/issues/2" TITLE : readme tutorial outdated BODY : i'm currently working on a university project. but im struggling with adding my one device to the chip. for the project i need to get a pwm working, which is a nice coincidence. anyway with the current state of the rocket-chip, the tutorial is not working. i understand that the rocket-chip is transitioning from tilelinkio to tilelinkio2 atm, so it's probably not the best idea to updated the tutorial right now. but like i said we are struggling to make it work, so any help or information would be very much appreciated.
