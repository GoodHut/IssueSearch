 URL : "https://github.com/RSGInc/SOABM/issues/10" TITLE : abm fails need to fail BODY : the abm is currently failing in non-critical ways. this makes it unclear if the model has actually run or not. in many cases many logs and outputs have populated, so someone new can easily mistake a failed run as a successful run that just ran really quickly. the abm setup needs to be updated so that a crticial fail means are hard stop in the model sequence - ideally with a nice clear notice to the user that something went wrong. currently in the setup, there is a critical fail in the abm, and the setup continues through 3 iterations of skimming in visum and failed abm runs...
