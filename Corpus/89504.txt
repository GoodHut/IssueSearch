 URL : "https://github.com/martinblech/xmltodict/issues/168" TITLE : question about item_depth BODY : what is the item_depth option actually supposed to do? if i set it to anything other than 0 the ordereddict returned is none? i'd like to discard several outer layers of hierarchy in the xml file s i'm working with... with open 'path/to/schema.xml', 'r', encoding='utf-8' as fd: result = xmltodict.parse fd.read , item_depth=2 pp.pprint result simply prints none. works fine with item_depth=0 , just adds layers to the dict. thanks!
