 URL : "https://github.com/shirsig/cdframes/issues/23" TITLE : cds not displaying BODY : i can configure all the settings for cdframes but it doesn't display mine or enemy cooldowns. i just redownloaded it from here although i did that about a month ago for all my addons and doesn't look like it's been updated since. i don't think it's been working since i did that but just got around to trying to fix it. i read it had conflicts with aux so i tried disabling aux, my aux version is also up to date. i disabled all addons except cdframes and it gave me the attached error message. tried deleting wdb. ! screenshot - 12_27_2017 3_29_40 pm - copy https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6473736/34393260-3dfaac04-eb1f-11e7-90ac-b3fe07410a1f.png
