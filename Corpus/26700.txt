 URL : "https://github.com/tskisner/hpcports/issues/55" TITLE : bump galsim version BODY : i'm working on cori. the current galsim is 1.3. i would like to go up to the latest pre-release tag. the tag is v1.5.0-alpha i've been using this code for quite some time and it is actually quite stable. and i need the functionality for the work i'm planning to do. is it possible to make this pre-release available, but not as default? and then when the full 1.5 release appears move over to that as the default?
