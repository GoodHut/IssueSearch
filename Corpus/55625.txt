 URL : "https://github.com/foundersandcoders/jwt_workshop/issues/19" TITLE : jwts are not encrypted BODY : a bit misleading: > information exchange: jwts can be used to securely transmit information between parties, since they are signed e.g. using public/private key pairs. the signature is determined based on both the header and the payload using a hashing algorithm, so you can check that the content hasn't been tampered with. jwts don't _securely_ transmit info. the signature is for verification only.
