 URL : "https://github.com/tangoshot/TangoShot/issues/1026" TITLE : support for obj idx BODY : this is currently done by whoosh. for some reason whoosh works on gae but i don't really understand why. it is possible that it is loading a frozen version of the whoosh index and uses that as readonly. anyway, the goal is to either move to datastore or search index. this should support search, as well as autocomplete.
