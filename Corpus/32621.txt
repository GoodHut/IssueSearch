 URL : "https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-dropdown-menu/issues/85" TITLE : visual tests broken BODY : the value is not selected in the html as content test due to the change https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-item/commit/f624672345bc56afa0919b87413343fea54a45a4 in vaadin-item. one possible workaround to make it pass is to use value for both dropdown menu and item in the demo. imo, it would be better to set value= html as content on the dropdown explicitly, but that is currently not possible due to the &nbsp; characters.
