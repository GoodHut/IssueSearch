 URL : "https://github.com/stepstone-tech/android-material-stepper/issues/184" TITLE : remember validated issues BODY : is there a way to remember which steps already got validated when you go back to previous steps? and that you can navigate through the already validated steps. for example you already validated step 1 through 4, you go back to step 1 to check up on something, and now want to go back to step 4.
