 URL : "https://github.com/AboudyKreidieh/circular_lane/issues/3" TITLE : lane changing simulations BODY : 1. ring road with single entry point for injecting, injection occurs if gap is large enough a. the time gap before next injection b. the valid gap size c. how the car splits the gap b. how the velocity of the entering car depends on the cars it is between 2. can redo with exit point to keep number of cars from inducing congestion 3. have the injection/ejection be a probability function, play around with the parameters try lognormal function of time headway how do we quantify the instability? 1. deviation from start velocity 2. deviation from start headway
