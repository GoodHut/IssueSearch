 URL : "https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/issues/294" TITLE : blocking uart rx BODY : i have problems reading pulse widths of receiver pwm signals with simple interrupt functions if serial has begun and data is coming into rx port. it does not matter you are reading or not, uart rx interrupt blocks the processor if there is data coming. since reading pwm signal has to be accurate up to microseconds, it may not be possible to measure correctly during serial rx data existance on line. is there a proper way to use both serial communication and my pwm interrupt functions to get accurate pulse widths.
