 URL : "https://github.com/nuxt-community/starter-template/issues/32" TITLE : optional es lint? BODY : i wanted to try nuxt out for a project, so i went with the starter template to get up & running fast. unfortunately, fast prototyping went out the window because es lint kept getting on to me about spaces and formatting. we could all stand to code a little cleaner, but the configuration meant that i couldn't get my code running until i formatted it how es lint demanded. not knowing enough about es lint to be able to disable it effectively and unable to find any information in the docs regarding it, i had to abandon using nuxt in the interest of saving time to get something deployed. digging into it more now, i see that i probably could've removed the es lint part of the nuxt.config.js, but none of this was really clear in my first introduction to nuxt. i'm also aware of the / eslint-disable / comment option, but that had to be done in every file. ideally there should be a configuration option just like in the vue webpack template https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack to add es lint so nuxt can be easily up & running without an es lint requirement. alternatively, some documentation on how to disable es lint would be helpful!
