 URL : "https://github.com/laurent22/rsync-time-backup/issues/78" TITLE : fn_rm not working over ssh BODY : deleting directories over ssh is not working. if -d $1 ; then is only checking if the directory $1 exists locally. when doing a backup over ssh it should check on the remote server. i tried fn_run_cmd test -d $1 but couldn't make it work. what's happening now is, it's going to the rm -f option but since that doesn't use the -r option itself, directories are not deleted at all.
