 URL : "https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/7250" TITLE : doc: kmeans and kmeans2 BODY : it is not clear to me from the documentation when i should use kmeans https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.cluster.vq.kmeans.html scipy.cluster.vq.kmeans and when kmeans2 https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.cluster.vq.kmeans2.html scipy.cluster.vq.kmeans2 . the cluster.vq module docs https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/cluster.vq.html module-scipy.cluster.vq do not clarify that either. there is also a stackoverflow question http://stackoverflow.com/q/20661142/562769 about this. i think at least the names of the parameters and their description could be made consistent: | kmeans | kmeans2 | | ------------- | ------------- | | obs | data | | k_or_guess | k | | iter | iter | | thres | thres | | - | missing | | check_finite | check_finite | | codebook | centroid | | distortion | - | | - | label | there is only the note > a different implementation of k-means clustering with more methods for generating initial centroids but without using a distortion change threshold as a stopping criterion. in kmeans. just looking at the documentation, it seems to me that it might be possible to join those two functions to one. if missing is used, then kmeans2 is used.
