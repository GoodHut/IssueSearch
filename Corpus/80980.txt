 URL : "https://github.com/SublimeText/LaTeXTools/issues/1076" TITLE : using jobname with root. BODY : i'm trying to set up a system where each chapter links to a single template which will display only the chapter while also having a master which displays all chapters. i would like building a chapter file to produce a pdf only containing the chapter contents while building master produces all chapters. master.tex one_chapter.tex chapters/ chapter1.tex chapter2.tex chapter3.tex master.tex includes all chapter files. each chapter file contains: %!tex jobname = chapterx %!tex root = one_chapter.tex ... the chapter sections and content... one_chapter.tex checks the jobname and includes's the chapter file matching the jobname. however, it seems as though jobname is ignored when you set root ? is there an easy method to do what i want?
