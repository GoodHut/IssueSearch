BODY : thanks for creating tornadofx! i'm still exploring options for kotlin + javafx for a new app, but tornadofx already seems like the most sensible choice. the guide is great as is the wiki, but i can't seem to find any hosted api docs for tornadofx. i'd like to explore the methods on types that are introduced in the guide. javadoc.io shows a weird javadoctrap class and nothing else. https://www.javadoc.io/doc/no.tornado/tornadofx/1.7.7 i understand that kotlin which i have very little experience with has kdoc instead of javadoc which might be making your life more difficult. i could also be completely blind and you have api docs hosted somewhere and i can't find it, but if it's there, it's well hidden: searching for the words api/javadoc/kdoc yields no interesting links on the main wiki page https://github.com/edvin/tornadofx/wiki/documentation or in the readme or in the guide.
