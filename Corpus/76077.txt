 URL : "https://github.com/kevingosman/prj-rev-bwfs-dasmoto/issues/1" TITLE : incorrect linking to css BODY : https://github.com/kevingosman/prj-rev-bwfs-dasmoto.git it seems you linked to your css file by linking to a local folder on your desktop. this won't allow the css file to render on computers outside from your own. you should instead link directly to the resources folder as follows: <link href= resources/css/style.css rel= stylesheet type= text/css >
