 URL : "https://github.com/decidim/decidim/issues/1354" TITLE : user name uniqueness BODY : this is a discussion :tophat: description user names are not unique right now, but maybe they should be. otherwise, users can easily impersonate someone else. the issue here is: how do we protect users that at the time of registering, were being impersonated? using authorizations don't seem to help as authorization data don't include the user's real name. thoughts @decidim/developers @decidim/product ?
