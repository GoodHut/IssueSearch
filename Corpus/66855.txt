 URL : "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/issues/189" TITLE : noise generator example BODY : i noticed there are no examples that show how to create radio noise, and not many / limited examples that show how to use the netstack_radio interface directly. both of which i think are important if contiki-ng is to remain as research-friendly os. i have some code for a simple noise generator, what's your view on adding this to examples? it's useful especially for cooja simulations; in fact, in bristol we use it for our sphere regression tests. there are disturber motes in cooja, but they do not play well with multichannel simulations - it's not possible to generate interference on just a specific range of channels.
