 URL : "https://github.com/DanmarksAdresser/Dawa/issues/537" TITLE : address cleaner issue BODY : hello devs, we were working on some stuff that uses the dawa as a geocoder for danish addresses. we do not get the return payload that we expect from dawa when we enter the following address: ravnsnæsvej 36, 3460 birkerød it would only get us the geocode latitude,longitude if we were to enter either: ravnsnæsvej 36a, 3460 birkerød ravnsnæsvej 36b, 3460 birkerød what we did was that we used the address cleaner via this get request: https://dawa.aws.dk/datavask/adresser?betegnelse= we then rely on the the href field from the resultater.aktueladresse array field to get what we want. while we managed to recover from this relatively quickly, we would like to know if there is a better way to deal with this or if this fix is already in the works.
