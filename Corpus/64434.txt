 URL : "https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/issues/380" TITLE : get connection per user BODY : finding out the connection state for a particular user is costly today since we have to retrieve the full list of connections and then extract the ones related to this user. the get connections request can take few seconds to complete on a setup with 1000s of connections. it would be helpful to add support for a user parameter in the url similar to what was done for the name parameter. http://localhost:15672/api/connections?user=bob 76
