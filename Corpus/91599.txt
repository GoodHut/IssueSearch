 URL : "https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-grid/issues/6049" TITLE : ui grid memory leak issue BODY : i am using ui grid v4.0.2, where its mentioned memory leak issue is fixed. i have total 174mb data bind to grid. if i do page refresh then only first time its loading data. but when i am trying to call api to get data and bind to grid second time its crashing. second time it should release memory but its not releasing , i can see previous memory references. - tried to reload state before calling api next time as on page refresh its working first time - tried cleaning all grid objects on $destroy and reset method before calling second time. delete $scope.gridapi; delete gridapi; delete $scope.griddata; but its crashing second time.
