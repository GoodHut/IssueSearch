 URL : "https://github.com/ellipticaljs/paper-autocomplete/issues/62" TITLE : allow custom input BODY : this element is awesome, congratulations for its contributors! however, my usage requires that the element to not be constrained by the source values, allowing custom inputs there too. this way, the autocomplete should act only as a helper to get to the result faster. can it be done today with some config property? i am currently using autocompleteelement.$.autocompleteinput.value to accept any value, but this is a really dirty workaround.
