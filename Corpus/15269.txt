 URL : "https://github.com/piroor/treestyletab/issues/1586" TITLE : dark theme colors BODY : i appreciate the fact that tst has a dark theme, but i think the colors could be tweaked a little bit to make it more aesthetically pleasing. for reference, here is what the dark theme currently looks like: ! tree-style-tab-dark https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3400780/32996444-ecc115f8-cd50-11e7-8615-e967e0f80955.png i added some css to the advanced section of the tst settings and got it to look like this: ! tree-style-tab-dark-after https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3400780/32996455-133e89b8-cd51-11e7-8085-37f870c1338a.png note how the background color of the tab bar and the tab color match that of the default firefox dark theme. this also improves the contrast between foreground and background. while i think a suggestion like this is more useful in the form of a pull request, i could not figure out where in the codebase these changes would be made, and i understand from 1356 that there are some areas of the browser window that cannot be themed by tst, leading to possibly incongruous themeing. i have added some of the userchrome.css suggestions from the tst wiki to my firefox profile in order to hide some parts of the window that can't be themed like the sidebar header , so in the default case it's possible that these changes would look terrible and would be better off as a wiki suggestion. additionally, i couldn't figure out how to change the color of the new tab button and of the blank space to the right of the pinned tabs, so hints on how to do those things would be appreciated. platform os : arch linux version of firefox: 57.0 version or revision of tree style tab: 2.2.11
