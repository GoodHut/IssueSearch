 URL : "https://github.com/libAtoms/JuLIP.jl/issues/71" TITLE : julia v0.7 feature freeze BODY : is already on 15 december. i am inclined to immediately move to v0.7 = v1.0, then i won't develop much at all for v0.6. i will just test whether the main dependencies are immediately being updated to work on v0.7
