 URL : "https://github.com/agrc/TrailsAddin/issues/6" TITLE : get usng id button BODY : use case: i need to recalculate the id for a segment/head that already has one. perhaps i split a segment. creating a tool that automatically overwrites the id would be dangerous because it could break existing routes. this tool would generate a segment for the selected feature and return it in a message box. then the user would have to explicitly copy and paste it into the feature that they want to update.
