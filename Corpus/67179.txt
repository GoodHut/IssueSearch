 URL : "https://github.com/mgmartel/WP-Tiles/issues/28" TITLE : page tiling not working BODY : dear mgmartel, thank you for your work on this theme, and for release a free version of it. can the theme also show pages in tiles, not just posts? from the docs it looks like it can, although when i included wp-tiles in the page it does not appear as a tile on the homepage. any info would be greatly appreciated. cheers, misha
