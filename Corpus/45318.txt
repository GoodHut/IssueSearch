BODY : hi, when the display is stuck because of invalid garbage data received , it's really hard to reset it. each time i wait until it discharges completely and it randomly begin to work again if i'm lucky until next garbage data . how do you deal with it on your setup? i haven't noticed that problem with adafruit library while watching demo, but your lib is very fast so i would like to keep using it, the only problem is hard to reset or maybe i'm doing something wrong? . thank you.
