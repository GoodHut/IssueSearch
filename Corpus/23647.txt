 URL : "https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-connector-mongodb/issues/402" TITLE : query nested array BODY : my model is as below: mymodel:{ name : mymodel , properties : { status :{type:string}, contact:{type: phone } } } phone:{ name : phone , properties : { type :{type:string}, number:{type:string} } } i am trying to fetch records where phone type and number both matches. i request like this mymodel.find {where:{and: { status : a },{contact.type: faxnumber },{ contact.number :{ regexp : 646$ }} }} so it brings records having number ends with 646 but not necessary that number is of type faxnumber. i tried elemmatch too in loopback but it didn't worked. so any suggestion what is wrong ? how to query such nested array? what s correct way to query such situation.
