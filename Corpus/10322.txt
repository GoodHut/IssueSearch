 URL : "https://github.com/alexcarpenter/butane-dropdown/issues/5" TITLE : buttons as items BODY : while i think button works well for the menu items, for some reason i feel this selector is too specific. i can imagine someone making an li with role= menuitem or maybe even a div . consider adding a class for each menu item and create the menuitems node list from this class selector. https://github.com/alexcarpenter/butane-dropdown/blob/1257a77f52f28025d38b94dfbccbd1eedf33d782/src/main.js l37
