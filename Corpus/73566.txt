 URL : "https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/issues/41" TITLE : cross dependency support BODY : some packages, like scipy, depend on packages already being installed on your system. in scipy's case, its numpy. i tried making piptool respect the order of requirements.txt , but it wasn't enough, because the scipy wheel won't build unless numpy is already installed. maybe we need a deps attribute in pip_import ?
