 URL : "https://github.com/agentm/project-m36/issues/103" TITLE : split out client library BODY : i doubt this is a high priority, but eventually it would be nice to avoid project:m36's massive dependency tree by pulling the client api out into a separate library. if the split allowed the library to only support remote connections, then it could be even lighter. an library that only supports in-process connection would also be nice and could shed a number of dependencies as well.
