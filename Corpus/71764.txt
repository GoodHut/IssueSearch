 URL : "https://github.com/PopulateTools/gobierto/issues/605" TITLE : admin invitations status BODY : - when you add a full new administrator via the new administrator link , the url to confirm account that is received is wrong. for staging from dival.gobify.net i've just received: http://gobify.net/admin/admin/confirmations... - so the link doesn't work. if you add a subdomain to the url, it tells you necesitas estar identificado para continuar - if you use the other option just invite an email , the url received is ok, but you are logged in automatically, you are not given the option to establish a password, and we don't provide yet a way to edit an admin account. i'd say we forget for the time being about the full invite, and just ask the user to establish a password when she clicks on the link in the invitation mail. we need to finish this for dival. cc @ferblape
