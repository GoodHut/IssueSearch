 URL : "https://github.com/edvorg/req-package/issues/41" TITLE : :build-in or :built-in BODY : in the readme and documentation for req-package.el, it says to use :build-in for built-in packages. however, the example in the readme uses :built-in , and req-package-providers-map also has :built-in . finally, in the changelog you have :build-int . note that using :built-in seems to causes the same issue as 40 but using :build-in - despite it not being the in the providers map - doesn't, though i haven't tried using those packages yet.
