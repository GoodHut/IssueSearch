 URL : "https://github.com/mim-Armand/TwiTool/issues/13" TITLE : loading for redux-persist BODY : loading effect for the initial loading of the state add the loading component that redux-persist accepts as props so it shows a nice loading message/effect when it's loading the initial state for rehydration especially needed to load large data from disk as we would need to do in the final product > please check the index.js under /client/src to see the commented line of code: loading={<loading />} , you just need to create a component perhaps inline and provide it as props there..
