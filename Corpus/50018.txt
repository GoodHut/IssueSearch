 URL : "https://github.com/BuddhistDigitalResourceCenter/owl-schema/issues/35" TITLE : using typed integers? BODY : should we keep xsd:positiveinteger instead of xsd:integer in the data? a few info i gathered this morning: - fuseki converts all integer types to integers, so query results don't know the original type all come as xsd:integer, i did a small test - when using json native types https://www.w3.org/tr/json-ld-api/ rdf-to-object-conversion , only xsd:integers get converted - it's quite easy to figure out if an integer is positive or not, and shacl has some rules to define a range https://www.w3.org/tr/shacl/ core-components-range if we keep the type, jsonld documents will look like json worknumberofvolumes : { @type : xsd:positiveinteger , @value : 1 }, instead of json worknumberofvolumes : 1 based on that i propose to make the ranges xsd:integer all the time and to use shacl rules in the future to check some ranges. wdyt?
