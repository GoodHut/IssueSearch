 URL : "https://github.com/ros-gbp/bfl-release/issues/11" TITLE : release for lunar BODY : bfl has appeared on the blocking list for lunar release: http://repositories.ros.org/status_page/blocked_releases_lunar.html?q=label%3d%22unblocked%22&s=6&r=1 the svn server dissapeared for kinetic so we rereleased using the existing imported 0.7 version in this repo: https://github.com/ros-gbp/bfl-release/commit/7b4f4543f1f72131878e24b7d8c3f1a9eb788ae3 however now i see that there's a 0.8 release listed with a tarball: http://www.orocos.org/orocos/source-code-2 and a new github repo: https://github.com/toeklk/orocos-bayesian-filtering is linked from the home page. it's not clear where the best source would be for lunar. the new git repo has a slightly different layout with the orocos-bfl package in a subdirectory. @toeklk might you have a suggestion whether it's worth moving forward to 0.8 for ros lunar or just repackaging 0.7 for now? @mikaelarguedas fyi re lunar progress
