 URL : "https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/dunai/issues/62" TITLE : publish dunai - 0.4 BODY : in order for bearriver to compile directly from hackage, it needs features that are not in the current version of dunai. so, we need to publish also dunai as is, and include new changes in the future. i believe this would have to be 0.4, if there were changes to the api moves, deletions since 0.3. i'd be happy to be proven wrong. list of changes: adds support for random numbers using monadrandom thanks jonathan thaler -- @thalerjonathan . removes msf constructor from many definitions by manuel b√§renz -- @turion . adds support for older ghc versions. moves some defintions/modules around. dunai.cabal: version bump 0.4 . examples/: changes licenses, updates examples to use new api.
