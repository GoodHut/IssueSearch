 URL : "https://github.com/JWDeveloper/JWManagement/issues/33" TITLE : rework shift teams ui BODY : if one clicks on the expand arrows in the team header, the image, description and the meeting points are shown. i'd suggest to also increase the height of each users row in this team. with that we can increase the telefon and email buttons 13 and show more information like the ones from the popup. this would also fix 32. we could even show the personal availability plan from the profile of that user and mark his other requests for this week. furthermore i'd suggest to always show the profile picture in front of the name.
