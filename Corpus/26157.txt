 URL : "https://github.com/yam655/tallytime/issues/4" TITLE : add trigger support BODY : when tallying time, we should support running triggers. two types: tallymark scripts: tallymark $mark $human_duration $second_duration tallyline scripts: tallyline $whole_line $human_duration $second_duration tallymark can easily be used to add csv entries to files automatically. it becomes possible to keep csv log data of the time with the project's data files. the tallyline style offers more flexibility, and comments can be passed to it without durations. using it would make it possible to have ad-hoc organizational structures/hierarchies/etc.
