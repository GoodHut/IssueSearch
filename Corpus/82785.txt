 URL : "https://github.com/AnatoliiPotapov/MNIST-EWC/issues/1" TITLE : asking a quick question : BODY : i have noticed that you have chosen $$ f_{i+1} = 0.3 \cdot f_{new} + 0.7 \cdot f_i $$ as the update rule for the fisher elements. i was wondering why are you choosing 0.7 and 0.3 as their weights, and why not directly use $$ f_{i+1} = f_{new}? $$ looking forward for your reply : best
