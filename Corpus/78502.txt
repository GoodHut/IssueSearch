 URL : "https://github.com/makasprzak/plantuml-dsl/issues/1" TITLE : publish to maven central BODY : i faced with an error building camel-visualizer: com.makasprzak.camel-visualizer:camel-visualizer:jar:1.0-snapshot: could not find artifact com.makasprzak.plantuml-dsl:plantuml-dsl:jar so, if somebody will use your libraries they have to download all transitive dependencies and build it locally which is not so convenient. could you please publish those cool stuff into maven central? :
