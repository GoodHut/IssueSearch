 URL : "https://github.com/kwitee/Card-project/issues/4" TITLE : card animation pool BODY : every time card animation is played, it should be added to animation pool instead. then the animation pool would play the animations one after other. the effects would happen instantly as they happen now, but the animations would happen one after the other. this way player isn't confused what the game did. some animations need to be changed for this to work.
