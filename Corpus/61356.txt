 URL : "https://github.com/nextsport/nextsport/issues/50" TITLE : app engine is fucked up BODY : okay, i thought that i got it with 49 but it doesn't look like that. i am at 8.33 of my 9 backend instance hours . i understand now, that with backend, the real backend is meant. and as far as i've planned i will route everything through go and use the template package which go provides. 45 that means, that 9 hours per day aren't enough to stay in the free quota of app engine. now i am not sure if i will stay at app engine or transfer to another hosting company which may be cheaper, but means i have to do a lot by myself. i will investigate. i made a quick fix for app engine, that i shows the static mockups without the routing through golang. that means, that the mockups will stay online. i hope so.
