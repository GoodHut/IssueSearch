 URL : "https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js/issues/1676" TITLE : mapdata and zoom BODY : is it possible today to use graph-level data as source in mapdata style mappers, more specifically - zoom? if not - is there some way to get the graph containing a specific element from the element itself as in - the argument to a regular style mapper function ? i've tried to investigate the second part of this question using console debugging without much luck.
