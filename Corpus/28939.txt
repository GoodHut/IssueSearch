 URL : "https://github.com/ushahidi/platform/issues/1808" TITLE : improve csv imports BODY : is it possible to improve the efficiency of the csv upload? this is a good right away solution, but longer term, i think we need to improve csv upload to import more lines of data. our paying users have consistently run into this issue -- they want to upload large data sets, but can't, and then have to go in and break them up into csv fils with 250 rows each. see: https://waffle.io/ushahidi/platform/cards/591f38387fdadb003ae95594
