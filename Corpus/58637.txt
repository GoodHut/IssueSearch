 URL : "https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/20886" TITLE : sqlccl: partition like BODY : it's expected that partitioning users will use the same partitioning across many tables/indexes in the same cluster. it would be nice if there was some way to define this once and share it across all of them even keeping them in sync if the one definition changed . a new syntax partition like table was proposed in the rfc, but got cut because there were too many rough edges and it wasn't a priority in the initial implementation. see https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/18683 for context . we should revisit at some point.
