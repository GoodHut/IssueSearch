 URL : "https://github.com/transistorsoft/cordova-background-geolocation-lt/issues/485" TITLE : new release 2.8.5 BODY : 2.8.5 - 2017-09-25 - added build for ios 11, xcode 9. - added implement new powersavechange event in addition to ispowersavemode method for determining if os power saving mode is enabled. - added new config elasticitymultiplier for controlling the scale of distancefilter elasticity calculation. - fixed android bug not firing schedule javascript listeners - fixed android crash ongoogleplayservicesconnecterror when google play services needs to be updated on device. new event: powersavechange ios ios power saving mode can be engaged manually by the user in settings -> battery or from an automatic os dialog. ! https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/lz3zl2jg4nzstg3/screenshot%202017-09-19%2010.34.21.png?dl=1 android android power saving mode can be engaged manually by the user in settings -> battery -> battery saver or automatically with a user-specified threshold eg: 15% . ! https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/raz8lagrqayowia/screenshot%202017-09-19%2010.33.49.png?dl=1 callbackfn paramters @param {boolean} ispowersavemode javascript backgroundgeolocation.on 'powersavechange', function ispowersavemode { console.log - powersavechange, power-saving mode enabled? , ispowersavemode ; } ; ispowersavemode in addition, you can retrieve the current state of power saving mode with the method ispowersavemode javascript backgroundgeolocation.ispowersavemode function ispowersavemode { console.log '- is power saving enabled? ', ispowersavemode ; } ; new config: elasticitymultiplier @config {float} elasticitymultiplier 1 controls the scale of automatic speed-based distancefilter elasticity. increasing elasticitymultiplier will result in fewer location samples as speed increases. a value of 0 has the same effect as disableelasticity: true .
