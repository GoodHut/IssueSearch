 URL : "https://github.com/jwadolowski/cookbook-cq/issues/45" TITLE : cq_jcr copy action BODY : it would be nice to have copy action in cq_jcr resource in order to make simple changes which not need groovy scripts. in my example i had to copy node with its children to new location and overwrite destination nodes with new one. however, copy action should be possible only for one particular node. use full sling api refference: http://sling.apache.org/documentation/bundles/manipulating-content-the-slingpostservlet-servlets-post.html copying-content additionaly i've written smal module in my cookbook which can be useful: module jcrhelper include cq::httphelper def copy_node instance, path, user, pass, src, dst, force payload = { ':operation' => 'copy', ':applyto' => {src} , ':dest' => {dst} , ':replace' => {force} } http_resp = http_multipart_post instance, path, user, pass, payload validate_resp http_resp, path end def validate_resp http_resp, path chef::application.fatal! something went wrong during operation on {path} \ http response code: {http_resp.code} \ http response body: {http_resp.body} \ 'please check error.log file to get more info.' unless http_resp.code.start_with? '20' end end
