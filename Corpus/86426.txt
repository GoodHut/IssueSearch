BODY : so i had a great time rendering a simple form on the server side and getting it to popup as a modal using this plugin, the entire process was so painless i was pretty impressed! the only issue.. when the user submits, it doesn't work properly. i understand why on a technical level, however it seems odd to me that i have to write some glue code to get the form submissions to work. the examples include a login form but it seems like the full story of that form isn't explained. is there any support for this case? i'm not sure what the best practice is... for now i'm rendering the form/form with errors server side and doing a simple content replace, unless the form submit was a success, in which case the server returns a special json response that includes a redirect url, and the client side event handler checks for that response and updates document.location appropriately. i feel like i've written a bit of a mess, but i don't know the simplest possible way of doing what i'm trying to do namely making a popup form that redirects the entire browser on success, presumably somewhat similar to the demo login popup . is there any document that describes a straightforward strategy for implementing ajax forms with this plugin? is there any interest in perhaps providing an opinionated but optional 'happy path' for making implementing forms in this manner more obvious?
