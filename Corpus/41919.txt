 URL : "https://github.com/HaArLiNsH/TextureReplacerReplaced/issues/6" TITLE : add reflective shader BODY : this is the issue for the pullrequest i'll send. you can find some documentation about the shader loader here: http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/161837-tutorial-how-to-load-and-use-custom-shaders-within-ksp/ http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/161837-tutorial-how-to-load-and-use-custom-shaders-within-ksp/ i also changed the startup time from instant to mainmenue, because i see no reason for such an early start, as no asset bundles are loaded and no shaders are available and modulemanager is still working.
