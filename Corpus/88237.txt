 URL : "https://github.com/nipy/heudiconv/issues/107" TITLE : multiple session handling BODY : hi, i was trying this tool today good work! . i was wondering if heudiconv can handle multiple sessions ? i have seen that the -ss flag can't take multiple session id moreover using the using the -ss flag with -b flag does not add the bids ses-<session_label>/ into the nifti filenames. is there a way to add it with heudiconv or i have to handle it myself?
