 URL : "https://github.com/yunity/foodsaving-backend/issues/273" TITLE : search for user id? BODY : you can only search for the display name with the /users part of the api, missing the possibility to search for user ids. we want to use this function for a foodshare in gothenburg g√∂teborg / sweden in order to notify the foodsavers via e-mail of available pickups that have not yet been taken by anyone etc. and without the option to search for particular user id's in the /users part of the api we are forced to ask for a larger dataset then needed. this may impact system performance in a future with many foodsavers.
