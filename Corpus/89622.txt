 URL : "https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-example-plugin/issues/19" TITLE : reaction init vs tutorial BODY : hello, i'm trying to learn reaction and i'm following the documentation. however, it seems installing reaction how it is described in https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/reaction-docs/master/installation leads to a unstable version of reaction. see the following issue as an example: https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-example-plugin/issues/17 is it only a tutorial issue ? is there any option to get the last stable version using reaction init ? could you update the documentation so newbies can start working with reaction again ? i'm concern about reaction plugins. an argument to use them is: implement your plugins, no need to change the core, only pull the latest core version, your plugins will still work . however, it seems not the case. thanks for your help.
