 URL : "https://github.com/mcandre/arrcheck/issues/1" TITLE : reimplement in go BODY : replace lib/arrcheck bash with a pure go implementation, making use of the https://github.com/mvdan/sh parser, so that very common bashisms like array literals ... and array indexing $somearray someexpression , ${somearray someexpression} , ${somearray somexpression } can be identified as well. this implementation will operate on a single path at a time for the first go implementation. designed to be piped from stank, just like bashate, checkbashisms, and shellcheck. by implementing in go, we will also be able to provide a more accurate exit status: 0 when no paths are passed to arrcheck by xargs. in fact, we will no longer rely on grep or bash to be installed in order to use arrcheck, and xargs will be integrateable but not requisite. the github.com/mcandre/stank suite should be augmented to allow for reporting specifically .sh / !/bin/sh scripts, so that arrcheck no longer warns for properly shebanged, or at least extensioned, bash-derived scripts bash, ash, dash, posh, ksh, ksh93, mksh, zsh . this will be similar to how checkbashisms behaves.
