 URL : "https://github.com/ethereumj/ethereumj/issues/3" TITLE : set the json-rpc port? BODY : been digging through the code and not finding any clear indication on this... would like to know how to set the port that json-rpc in ethereumj is using. see that jsonwhisperer takes a url but it's not clear how this is set. https://github.com/ethereum/ethereumj/blob/develop/ethereumj-core/src/main/resources/ethereumj.conf is apparently the main config but it contains nothing about json rpc. any pointers on this?
