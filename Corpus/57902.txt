 URL : "https://github.com/JohnMcLear/ep_copy_paste_images/issues/14" TITLE : report of several bugs BODY : i have noticed several problems with this plugin... just to inform 1. loss of image quality - i noticed a huge loss in image quality, in both print and pad... i googled a bit and it should be possible to store base64 images without quality loss 2. deleting images not always possible, either it gets duplicated or simply stays - selecting the line above, the image and line below seems to fix it most of the time 3. jump in pad on resize - fixed if you select a line near the image 4. print size doesn't equal size shown in pad
