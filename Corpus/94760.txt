 URL : "https://github.com/ADTRAN/gradle-scala-multiversion-plugin/issues/1" TITLE : clean removes prior builds BODY : if i run gradle clean , then of course my build directory is cleaned. if i run gradle assemble , then i see the multiple versions output in build/lib . üëç if i run gradle clean assemble , then i see output in build/lib for only the last scala version defined in the scalaversions property. this leads me to believe without looking at the code that this plugin re-runs every task for each scala version. maybe it should only run clean once?
