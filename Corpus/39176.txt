 URL : "https://github.com/SockDrawer/StoryBB/issues/237" TITLE : rework spider system BODY : right now, spider detection is off by default for 'performance reasons' never mind that these can be mitigated by things like sane caching this is because the list of spiders is configurable. to my knowledge only one person ever actually used this ui and mostly made a plugin to extend the list of spiders for other users. i propose having the list of standard bots be in the code rather than the database, that the lightest option of tracking is actually on by default means the expectation of 'hey, it should at least list which bots are visiting' will be fulfilled by default and extend the list to be more up to date as i don't think it's changed in 10 years. it would also mean we could provide some actual detail on the bots visiting if we cared to, e.g. links to find out more about them.
