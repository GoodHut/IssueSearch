BODY : matmos adds environmental sounds ie water dripping when near dripping water, rumbling while near lava, wind during storms, birds at day and crickets at night. not sure if it is a forge mod, i will have to check. i remember it being in the old tekkit and on some other ftb packs, so i'm sure there is a version that will work.
