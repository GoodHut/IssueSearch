 URL : "https://github.com/mon2au/invoicebinder/issues/1" TITLE : suggestions and questions BODY : i found this repo by browsing to find an invoice application for my small computers shop. one thing that could improve a lot imo flow when using the program is that when we click on an invoice by default it would bring us to this invoice in one double-click and it should work from anywhere in the program. another things that would be cool would be to integrate paypal/square payment online by the customer in a page. we could send the invoice to the customer by email and in the email there would be a link to a secure page to make the payments. anyway i'm impressed by the quality of this webapp ðŸ˜„ . one last quick question i'd like to know is if it's that relatively easy to translate french the app and put 2 taxes like we have in quebec canada ? also i'd like to know if we can edit the template to ad various legal conditions and payments options ? regards :octocat:
