 URL : "https://github.com/vonovak/react-native-add-calendar-event/issues/3" TITLE : report from production : BODY : 1. ios - case: you have 1 or more shared calendars in your calendar app . when you try to select another calendar than default when creating event - app crashes. it is because app wanna access to contacts ? and needs description in nscontactsusagedescription to ask such permissions. after adding nscontactsusagedescription, app lib doesn't crash and function normally after asking permission in ether granted or not granted result of request. 2. ios - without nscontactsusagedescription and without asking about access to contacts - when create event dialog popped it is possible to add members to created event from your contacts. with nscontactsusagedescription added it is possible only when permission to contacts granted. it this an ios bug? ¯\_ ツ _/¯ 3. android - on all androids prior 5.0 and aft it is sufficient to grant only write_calendar permission to create events - except for any sony phone we have in our testing team . sony phones requires read_calendar permission both with old 4.x and new 5..7 android on board. app doesn't crashes, not it receives any exception - but event in calendar is not creating. the need of such permission read shows on old androids a weird message before installation about this app can read and delete all your private calendars on this device . ---- proposals: do not pop alerts from library ios , exceptions are sufficient enough. this is because of need to show localized alert to user from app. i can send pr for this.
