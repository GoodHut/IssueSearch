 URL : "https://github.com/ioos/ioos-us/issues/140" TITLE : ug2 publications page BODY : per my conversation with jim, we want to add a publication list to the ug2 page. it should be linked in the left menu under the glider activities header as the top menu item publications . the pubs should be listed like journal references and they should be binned by year. i think we should have 2017, 2016, 2015, and prior to 2015. jim had said he could put tabs at the top for going between the years. we'll add years as we go, but the front tab should be the most recent. for an initial set of articles, i'd like to use the references in the glider white paper https://gliders.ioos.us/files/natl_glider_ntwrk_plan_final.pdf . they are in appendix a. if it is too hard to extract from the pdf, i should have a word version of the doc that i can send.
