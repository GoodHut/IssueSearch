 URL : "https://github.com/firebase/firebaseui-web/issues/115" TITLE : offline access support BODY : hi, thank you for a great opensource library. i have have a use case that is not fully supported at the moment. i am looking to implement something that might be described as a hybrid auth solution, with both my front-end web client and back-end needing to access firebase and other google apis on my users behalf even when not signed in. here are some links that describe similar use cases: https://github.com/dart-lang/googleapis_auth/issues/5 https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/crossclientauth - android app obtains offline access for web back-end i think i can just about create the auth request manually to be able to do this: https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?scope=https%3a%2f%2fwww.googleapis.com%2fauth%2fcalendar&access_type=offline&include_granted_scopes=true&response_type=code%20token&client_id=example&redirect_uri=https%3a%2f%2fexample.com although now it seems i have to include a 'nonce'. i was wondering if this could be natively supported by this library by allowing something like: signinoptions: { provider: firebase.auth.googleauthprovider.provider_id, scopes: 'openid','https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar','profile','email' , acess_type:'offline', response_type:'code token id_token' } , / acess_type:'offline' <-- not sure this is needed until server needs to get access token using autherization code / oh i should mention i have tried implementing: https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/javascript/reference/referencedocs googleauthgrantofflineaccessoptions but no matter what i tried this seems to always trigger a popup, which is far from ideal, considering the used should have already accepted permission from a redirect flow moments before, and this is a mobile first web app. unless you have any ideas i am stuck doing this manually for now!
