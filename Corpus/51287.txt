 URL : "https://github.com/deadlydog/New-NuGetPackage/issues/6" TITLE : adding to a local feed BODY : how should we setup config.ps1 so that we can use runmetouploadnugetpackage.cmd to add a package to a local feed hosted on a network folder? microsoft docs https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/hosting-packages/local-feeds say to use the nuget add command: nuget add new_package.1.0.0.nupkg -source \\myserver\packages . i tried setting $sourcetouploadto to the unc path, and $apikey key to a dummy value and this seemed to work, but i'm not sure if this is correct.
