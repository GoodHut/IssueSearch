 URL : "https://github.com/NVSL/Linuxduino/issues/1" TITLE : change /devices to /dev BODY : currently for opening a device, for example /dev/i2c-1 , you need to rename it to /devices/i2c-1 , this is because only for /dev emscripten fails to mount /dev because it already exists. so currently we create /devices instead: c fs.mkdir '/devices' ; fs.mount nodefs, { root: '/dev' }, '/devices' ; proposed solutions: 1. fix the root of the problem on emscripten. 2. make some code so whenever the user uses /dev/... , change to path to /devices/... .
