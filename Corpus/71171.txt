 URL : "https://github.com/wireapp/wire/issues/19" TITLE : access to server sources BODY : a while back the wire developers said that they would be making the source code for the server available sometime before q2 0 1 , we are currently in april, and i would assume that this means that q1 has already passed if not about to . i am creating this as a reminder that the server's source-code is to be published according to the two links . also, i was going to try asking about these things on a mailing list or irc channel, but found none. perhaps one should be created? 0 https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/opinion/wire/ 1 https://medium.com/wire-news/wires-independent-security-review-61f37a1762a8
