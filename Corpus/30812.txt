 URL : "https://github.com/OpenZWave/node-openzwave-shared/issues/205" TITLE : readme value events BODY : on the events readme https://github.com/openzwave/node-openzwave-shared/blob/master/readme-events.md it is suggested that the third parameter is valueid while it is actually a value object. see below. zwave.on 'value added', function nodeid, commandclass, valueid {...} it may also apply to the following: zwave.on 'value refreshed', function nodeid, commandclass, valueid {...} zwave.on 'value changed', function nodeid, commandclass, valueid {...} sorry if this is not the correct way to report issues.
