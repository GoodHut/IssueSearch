 URL : "https://github.com/hrydgard/ppsspp/issues/10101" TITLE : dtm race driver 2 and 3 BODY : dtm race driver have large thick lines across the screen. i ve tried everything but it's same problem. like this picture: https://goo.gl/images/w6ep9a i saw you wrote 8 months ago:probably broken geometry that gets discarded by the real psp because the coordinates are way outside the guardband, and the psp doesn't do proper triangle clipping. i'll send a pull request later with an experimental fix for d3d11 but it relies on undefined behaviour in vertex shaders to kill triangles, which isn't very nice. a correct fix will need geometry shaders. when you will fix this hrydgard?: .
