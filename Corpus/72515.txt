 URL : "https://github.com/jsocol/django-waffle/issues/246" TITLE : call for maintainer help BODY : to answer @clintonb's question in 245—perhaps it's already obvious—this project has not been high on my list lately, due to any number of factors i don't write a lot of python day-to-day at the moment, weekends have been nice outside lately, others . to keep the project alive will need the support of more maintainers. i love to add two or three folks to github and pypi who 1. use waffle in their day jobs / active projects; 2. have at least opened a pr, even if i haven't merged it; 3. want to see waffle improve, hopefully beyond their immediate needs; and 4. care about making open source a welcoming and inclusive space. if you'd like to help out i suspect a couple of folks from 245, 243, 241, 226 and other recent issues might be willing, but don't want to assume please comment here or email me, and let me know your pypi username.
