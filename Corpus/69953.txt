 URL : "https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/574" TITLE : unused resource strings BODY : i've noticed that title_activity_channel string saying channelactivity in english currently is not used anywhere in the ui as far as my grep skills allow me to know . it's been sitting there confusing translators for some time 9a0f61e60bf325811fe8529880acaf97386f08bb and there's now a variety of different kinds of translations people came up with, otherwise i wouldn't raise this issue. so can we remove this string? or maybe there's a bigger question. i'm not an android developer, but is there a way to see if a particular string is unused currently? can it be automated in a way that makes sense and put into e.g. ci? - x i carefully read the contribution guidelines https://github.com/teamnewpipe/newpipe/blob/head/.github/contributing.md and agree to them. - x i checked if the issue/feature exists in the latest version.
