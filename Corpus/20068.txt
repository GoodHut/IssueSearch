 URL : "https://github.com/jlewi/mlkube.io/issues/6" TITLE : better gpu support BODY : we should make it easier to use gpus. right now to use gpus the user would have to add appropriate volume mounts to the podspec in the tfjob to mount the gpu devices from the host and set other specs like environment variables if needed. i think we should have a higher level api. for example type tfreplicaspec struct { ... gpus gpuspec } type gpuspec struct { type string count int32 } the tfjob controller could then be instantiated with the necessary information to add the appropriate volume mounts and scheduling information to the pods.
