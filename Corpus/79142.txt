 URL : "https://github.com/AltBeacon/android-beacon-library/issues/498" TITLE : rssi values vs distances BODY : hi, i am not sure if i this is the right place to post this issue here or on stackoverflow.com. we tried to use the altbeacon library in order to get the distances from the rssi. we expected to see low rssi values i.e., going away from the zero as the phone is further away from the beacon. actually, we are seeing the reverse of that behavior. in other words, as we are further away from the beacon, we receive higher rssi values i.e., close to zero and as we get close to the beacon, we receive low rssi values i.e., far from zero we kept repeating the run and it is always the same issue. we are using google pixel g-2pw4100 and os version android 7.1 nougat. in addition, the latest altbeacon library is used. just want to know if it happened before with anybody. any guidance is appreciated. thank you, ghassan
