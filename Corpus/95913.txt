 URL : "https://github.com/kumabook/stickynotes/issues/82" TITLE : does not work in linux/x11 BODY : it appears to me that much of the basic functionality of stickynotes does not work on linux/x11. the following items do not work at all, or do not work properly, although on windows10 they all work perfectly. 1. generate sticky will place the sticky in lower left corner of the webpage, therefore often out of sight, rather than under cursor. 2. move sticky with mouse1 does not work at all. 3. resize sticky with mouse1 shows signs of working but the dragged out shape does not last. these problems may be the reason why some users have reported in their review that the stickynotes does not work at all . praise: i like the fact that you use sqlite with json export/.import, and that you have search functionality. it would be even nicer if i could set the location of the sqlite file to some arbitrary location outside the profile directory.
