 URL : "https://github.com/ethereumproject/TokenMint/issues/81" TITLE : pumpkin spice test run BODY : issues i came across while minting ðŸŽƒpsl: - password is shown in plain text - inefficent use of int in token defaults to uint256 vs something more rational - funding goal should auto calculate - contract address hangs off tile on the crowd sale selector - clicking on token contract takes to tokenmint.com<gastracker.io/ address> in the crowd sale - crowd sale address never shows up/ no place to view crowd sales in header except registered tokens no enter an address to see xyz token info - registry info should populate/ be part of the crowd sale process - make sure registry pays enough to list and tells that their is a listing fee - wallet doesn't show tokens launched - no error msg displayed when wrong password is typed
