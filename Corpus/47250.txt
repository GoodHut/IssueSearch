 URL : "https://github.com/w3c/webpayments-payment-apps-api/issues/115" TITLE : open window algorithm BODY : this algorithm that i'm adding in https://github.com/w3c/webpayments-payment-apps-api/pull/106 is very similar to the open window algorithm in the service workers specification because i've copied and pasted most of it . should we refer to the service workers specification instead of copying their steps? the thing is, our algorithm is not exactly the same, so we might have to say something inelegant, like run the open window algorithm, but skip step number four and set some value to the internal slot windowclient just before returning .
