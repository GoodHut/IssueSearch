 URL : "https://github.com/sebelga/gstore-node/issues/70" TITLE : custom promise library BODY : it would be awesome to be able to plug in a custom promise library i.e. bluebird , just like you would with mongoose. i know you can set a custom lib for @google-cloud/datastore, but it would be even cooler to have this feature for gstore-node
