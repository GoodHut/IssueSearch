 URL : "https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme/issues/818" TITLE : prop equality hook BODY : some test frameworks allow asymmetric matching, via special functions or values, for example jest: js const actual = foo ; expect actual .toequal expect.stringmatching /f/ // passes it'd be nice if we could use these with enzyme: jsx const something = => <div> <span id= foo >hello!</span> </div> ; const wrapper = mount <something /> ; expect wrapper.containsmatchingelement <span id={expect.stringmatching /f/ } /> .tobe true ; // doesn't work right now but it's obviously not enzyme's responsibility to implement these on behalf of the frameworks. i'm thinking it'd be nice if enzyme had an api for hooking into its equality checking so that frameworks could feature asymmetric matching integration with enzyme. it looks like the relevant change needs to occur here: https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme/blob/c64474073e71277a940b9c93b14c1c01bde94b66/src/utils.js l123 one way it could be implemented would be with a shared symbol. this is similar to what util.inspect does: jsx import { mount, isequalsymbol } from enzyme ; const myasymmetricmatcher = { isequalsymbol : othervalue => { // receives foo in this case return /f/.test othervalue ; // returns true to indicate values are equal }, }; const wrapper = mount <something /> ; expect wrapper.containsmatchingelement <span id={myasymmetricmatcher} /> .tobe true ; // passes cc @cpojer @vjeux
