 URL : "https://github.com/PhonologicalCorpusTools/SLP-Annotator/issues/118" TITLE : changes in terminology BODY : i would like to suggest changes in terminology to improve consistency between slot, slot flagging, and global handshape options. 1. for a slot option ? , the description should be changed from 'obscured' to 'unestimatable'. if we click on any slot, the list of permitted characters at the bottom right corner includes ? obscured . this should all be changed to ? unestimatable . 2. global handshape options can be changed as follows: the sign is partially obscured --> coding estimated the coding for this sign is uncertain --> coding uncertain the coding for this sign is incomplete --> coding incomplete
