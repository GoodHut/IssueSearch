 URL : "https://github.com/ServUO/ServUO/issues/2371" TITLE : gary the dungeon master BODY : gary seems to make copies of himself that are sitting directly on top of each other so it's hard to notice. only one of the copies actually does anything besides sit there. rolling dice and speaking . the first time this was noticed there were about 30 or so copies of him. i removed them all and now he's back up to 3 copies. moved them from the chair so they could be seen attach 9268 /attach reported by: visam report thread: http://servuo.com/threads/gary-the-dungeon-master.7718/
