 URL : "https://github.com/gomita/verticaltoolbar/issues/50" TITLE : information for you BODY : sir, as you may know, vertical toolbar will not work in firefox after version 57 if you were not aware of this, see this article https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/software/the-future-of-firefox-add-ons/ or do a google search on firefox addons and check out the google news tab . i would like you to know that there is a browser where your add-on will still continue to work into the foreseeable future. if you would be so kind as to examine the pale moon browser http://www.palemoon.org/ you will find not only a great browser but a very active development community dedicated to keeping the old firefox values of speed and customizability alive. in pale moon, your vertical toolbar add-on currently works when installed via the moon tester tool, which you can find here https://addons.palemoon.org/addon/moon-tester-tool/ . once you have pale moon installed and assuming you already have the vertical toolbar xpi file handy on your computer, open the moon tester tool in the extensions page and press the select file button. select the vertical toolbar xpi file. once it has installed, you can then customize it however you wish - it works great! vertical toolbar is a great add-on. mozilla has done a great disservice to both the firefox user and firefox add-on communities by moving away from xul. in my opinion, firefox has become just another version of google chrome. vertical toolbar needs just a little tweaking to work with pale moon without having to resort to the moon tester tool. please consider investing the small amount of time it would take to make your add-on compatible with pale moon. thank you for your time.
