 URL : "https://github.com/nteract/nteract/issues/1933" TITLE : remove splash screen BODY : it seams like electrons startup is now faster than it used to be. now the dom takes longer to load than the splash screen itself. what do you think, should we remove it entirely and focus our efforts on providing a smoother initial startup? this is 0.3.1 the splash screen doesn't even appear : ! kapture 2017-10-04 at 12 43 56 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13285808/31171972-0df72cf8-a902-11e7-9ea2-77c29060893c.gif
