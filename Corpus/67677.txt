 URL : "https://github.com/michalmuskala/jason/issues/15" TITLE : provide pretty printing BODY : to keep the speed, the pretty-printing has to be done outside of the main encoding loop. this means, adding an additional pass, after the whole encoding is done, to pretty-print the result. this will be slower, but i don't think the speed is extremely important when using prettified json.
