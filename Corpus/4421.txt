 URL : "https://github.com/faroukcharkas/parss/issues/1" TITLE : convert to es6 BODY : all supported versions of nodejs now support es6. it might be a good idea to use at least the es6 best practices for the supported features for the earliest supported version at the moment? here are some examples: 1. changed use of var to let or const . function expressions, modules https://github.com/faroukcharkas/parss/blob/master/parss.js l4-l10 , arrays https://github.com/faroukcharkas/parss/blob/master/parss.js l29 , immutable objects https://github.com/faroukcharkas/parss/blob/master/parss.js l16-l133 and variables that don't change should be set to const , the rest should be let . 2. convert these anonymous functions https://github.com/faroukcharkas/parss/blob/master/parss.js l35-l42 and others like it to arrow functions. 3. implement template literals instead of long string variable concats https://github.com/faroukcharkas/parss/blob/master/parss.js l63 . 4. convert these two functions https://github.com/faroukcharkas/parss/blob/master/parss.js l63 and their inner flow control to chains of promises.
