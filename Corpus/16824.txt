 URL : "https://github.com/eqcss/eqcss/issues/75" TITLE : making eqcss work BODY : i'm using django so all my front-end assets are loaded from a static file folder. first, i try to load the script from eqcss.js . then i load my custom custom styles from respond.eqcss which contains element queries. <script src = {% static 'js/eqcss.js' %} ></script> <script type = text/eqcss src = {% static 'css/respond.eqcss' %} ></script> for whatever reason, this isn't working at all. i have valid element queries, and i believe i've loaded my styles properly, but i can't seem to determine why the styles aren't taking affect. does anyone have any ideas?
