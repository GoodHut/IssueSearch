 URL : "https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/4295" TITLE : what does === mean? BODY : the docs describe the == and === operators as 'equality' and 'case equality'. unfortunately, the last time isn't defined anywhere --- does it mean it's case sensitive or case insensitive ? this came up after seeing that case uses === for testing its values. it doesn't really make a lot of sense for case to use case insensitive comparisons, which makes me wonder whether == is actually case sensitive --- but that's kinda weird as well, because == is used to compare non-string values. could we have this explicitly called out and clarified in the otherwise pretty good docs, please?
