 URL : "https://github.com/openego/oeplatform/issues/248" TITLE : merge polygons on load BODY : the polygons on maps work fine right now. but the map can not be used properly, as just a small subset of all polygons is shown. this may not be what is wanted by the user e.g. for the grid districts over germany . we need to check, whether it is possible to load all polygons that are in visible range and unify them. this merging should be done using the st_union function on the server side. - enable map views that show all aggregated data for visible range - add a show all filter for maps
