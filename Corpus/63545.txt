 URL : "https://github.com/smaslennikov/whattimeisitrightmeow/issues/14" TITLE : email when time changes BODY : as a consumer of the fourth dimension, i would like a convenient way to receive updates if the time happens to change. with the current implementation, if i want to know if the time has changed, i need to visit your website. i propose that email functionality be provided. this way, users can be notified immediately when and if the time changes. is this something on your project roadmap, or is it only planned for a future enterprise edition?
