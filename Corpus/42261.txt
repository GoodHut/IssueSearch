 URL : "https://github.com/psieg/Lightpack/issues/143" TITLE : api leds indexed at 1 BODY : i'm playing around with the api for the first time and i noticed something odd. i was trying to get the setcolortoall function working, and what finally succeeded was starting the index at 1 rather than 0. although the led map received from the api is indexed at 0, prismatik won't respond to a set command starting with a 0 index. a set command for indices 1 through n+1 seems to fill all leds, but it's still inconsistent and should be fixed. i tested this with both my adalight setup and a virtual led device.
