 URL : "https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/issues/987" TITLE : old spec tests BODY : the spec test submodule was last updated in oct 2016, before webassembly 1. i tried running wasm-shell on some of the new tests. many of them work ok, but there are a lot of failures, many unrelated to the flat format. i also noticed that some assertions are marked as passed even though they were just ignored e.g. assert_return_arithmetic_nan . it's probably worth updating to the newest spec tests, marking the newly failing tests, and filing issues for the failures.
