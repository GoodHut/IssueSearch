 URL : "https://github.com/SpongePowered/Mixin/issues/164" TITLE : array access redirect BODY : basically i want to turn my column class into a chunk mixin this will allow to make compatibility with sponge much easier , and the only thing that makes it close to impossible is that i can't redirect access to extendedblockstorage array to my own method. for example with code like this: java public int getlightfor enumskyblock p_177413_1_, blockpos pos { int i = pos.getx & 15; int j = pos.gety ; int k = pos.getz & 15; extendedblockstorage extendedblockstorage = this.storagearrays j >> 4 ; return / complicated logic here /; } i want to be able to return different extendedblockstorage, without any array access. in this example case it can be worked around by redirecting blockpos.gety but in cases like public iblockstate getblockstate final int x, final int y, final int z i would need to modify method argument, which may have unintended side effects when something else modifies that method. and working around that issue is much less clear and fragile than redirecting array access.
