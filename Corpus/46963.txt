 URL : "https://github.com/DumpsterDoofus/Twitch-Chat-Downloader/issues/1" TITLE : new twitch video urls BODY : the program doesn't seem to be able to use the new format of twitch vod urls. also, if a video has no chat the program errors without writing any srt files. so, if using the 'pastbroadcasts' function it just bloats the log for nothing. ! untitled https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32455387/31077767-c502dcbe-a74d-11e7-97df-c2047bdee708.png
