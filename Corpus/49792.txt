 URL : "https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip/issues/2385" TITLE : update s3 permissions BODY : hi there we currently have a whole whack of images on s3 with public read and we would like to move them to private, i've updated the code so that all new documents added have a private link but how do i go about updating the existing images to be private? currently if i inspect the instance it shows @s3_permissions={:default=>:private} but i can still access it publicly. thanks
