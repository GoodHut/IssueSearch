 URL : "https://github.com/rafaeljusto/toglacier/issues/91" TITLE : update tool automatically BODY : it would be great if the tool could check and update itself. in linux and freebsd environments we could use a package repository to guarantee this, but i'm not sure if there's something similar in windows environments. attention: we should to be very careful with security here. we need to make sure that we are downloading a new version of the tool.
