 URL : "https://github.com/Floens/Clover/issues/331" TITLE : request: ios release BODY : i recently bought an iphone to replace my galaxy s2. while i was setting up my new phone, i checked the appstore to see if there were any 4chan clients. only one of them is half decent, and it's called the chan. i bought the app, and it is terrible. download the app yourself, and you'll see what i mean. it's not even close to clover in terms of app quality and usability. everything in that app is horrendous. android version: ios 10.3.2 can't jailbreak this, so fortune is out of the question phone model: iphone 6 plus clover version: i wish floens plz
