 URL : "https://github.com/manuelstofer/esformatter-align/issues/10" TITLE : objectalignment on colon BODY : when aligning assignments the '=' sign is well aligned: javascript const promise = require 'bluebird' const db = require './db' const lib = require './lib' const cron = require './cron' const common = require '../utils/common' const eth = require '../utils/eth' const pg = require './postgres' but when i align objects, the ':'-sign is attached to the keys, but not aligned: javascript { user: { address: user.address, notificationtoken: getnotificationtoken user.authentification }, connector: connector, secondstorent: secondstorent, confirmed: confirmed || false } but i would rather have it aligned the same way: javascript { user : { address : user.address, notificationtoken : getnotificationtoken user.authentification }, connector : connector, secondstorent : secondstorent, confirmed : confirmed || false } is there a easy way to support this like webstorms 'align on colon'
