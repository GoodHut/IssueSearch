 URL : "https://github.com/jeffschwartz/yada/issues/19" TITLE : simplify tab bar user api BODY : currently the user needs to listen to click events and show the tab's content. this should be the default action built into the component itself. to allow the user finer control, allow user to pass an optional callback, which the component will call. if the callback returns true then show the tab's content, other do not show the tab's content. this will also allow the user to perform some asynchronous task that might be required to obtain the content.
