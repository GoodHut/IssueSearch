 URL : "https://github.com/nkolban/esp32-snippets/issues/211" TITLE : descriptor callback class BODY : we need bledescriptorcallback class with at least onwrite method. now we start to send notifications and indications when client connects to server, but this is not good approach. we also cant have an option to stop sending notifications when client is still connected but dont need/want to receive any notifications/indications. with descriptor callback we will be able to move start/stop notifications from server callback and to have the proper control on it.
