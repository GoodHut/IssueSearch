 URL : "https://github.com/ekunuke/vagante_issues/issues/130" TITLE : macos controller support BODY : i play the game via ps3 controller, and sometimes via keyboard. it works great. but i also have some other controllers available and i'd like to use them for local co-op gameplay: ouya controller steelseries stratus xl for the ouya controller, the game reports buttons being pressed a green debug info pops up but the game doesn't actually bind them. for the steelseries stratus xl, only the axis and the central button do work. i'm testing with v54 on macos sierra. i'm available to offer more in-depth debug with those controllers, feel free to get in touch.
