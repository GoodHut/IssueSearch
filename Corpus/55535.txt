 URL : "https://github.com/rakr/vim-one/issues/48" TITLE : italic comment for c++ BODY : hi really like your one color scheme. thank you! i used vim with one color scheme to edit a cpp file today, and noticed that the comments are not italic, italic comment works fine with other file types. italic comment for c++ used to work. not sure what is going wrong, might be vim itself. can you have a look please? thanks b
