 URL : "https://github.com/BEEmod/BEE2.4/issues/527" TITLE : installing the dev version BODY : normally, i would try just dumping all the files into the main bee2 directory, and that's probably how it's supposed to be done, but the normal version and the dev branch files do have a few key differences, so it would be helpful to have a guide somewhere to smooth, safe, and not-breaky installation of the dev version.
