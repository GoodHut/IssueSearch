 URL : "https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/issues/282" TITLE : ability to mute others BODY : sometimes one of the ppl in the call is in a hugely noisy environment or has horrible echo and doesn't realize it or is super slow to respond to calls to turn it off. with more than 2 or 3 ppl in a call the ability to mute each other becomes quite important. i suggest to just allow everyone to mute everyone else - the 1% of cases where this is unwanted seem rare enough to perhaps warrant an option somewhere but i'm not terribly worried about that.
