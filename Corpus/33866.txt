 URL : "https://github.com/dollparts818/prj-rev-bwfs-dasmoto/issues/1" TITLE : avoid absolute links BODY : your links to files in your code are broken on any machine other than yours. that's because it's an absolute link full link path that relates to your specific file structure . technically it's close to a relative link, but mostly you're trying to access a project directory that only starts at ../resources/ and anything before that folder isn't in the path. we want to use relative links which doesn't specify the whole path so that the file will be accessible on any machine. something similar to this: href= ./file_path_from_root_to_folder/styles.css obviously replacing the file path placeholder with the path from the root of the project to the image/asset you want to access. https://github.com/dollparts818/prj-rev-bwfs-dasmoto/blob/master/05%20-%20dasmoto's%20arts%20and%20crafts/index.html l7
