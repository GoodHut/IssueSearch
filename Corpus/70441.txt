 URL : "https://github.com/fact-project/photon_stream/issues/9" TITLE : warnings when importing BODY : maybe not a bug but somewhat weird nonetheless. when import photon_stream i get errors related to some gui frameworks. i guess most likely related to some macos related matplotlib backend foo. so i guess this is just some messed up configuration on my end. however i'm wondering if dependency to the plotting stuff is needed when one only wants to read the data. in 1 : import photon_stream as ps objc 30872 : class tkapplication is implemented in both /system/library/frameworks/tk.framework/versions/8.5/tk and /users/mackaiver/.anaconda3/lib/libtk8.5.dylib. one of the two will be used. which one is undefined. objc 30872 : class tkmenu is implemented in both /system/library/frameworks/tk.framework/versions/8.5/tk and /users/mackaiver/.anaconda3/lib/libtk8.5.dylib. one of the two will be used. which one is undefined. objc 30872 : class tkcontentview is implemented in both /system/library/frameworks/tk.framework/versions/8.5/tk and /users/mackaiver/.anaconda3/lib/libtk8.5.dylib. one of the two will be used. which one is undefined. objc 30872 : class tkwindow is implemented in both /system/library/frameworks/tk.framework/versions/8.5/tk and /users/mackaiver/.anaconda3/lib/libtk8.5.dylib. one of the two will be used. which one is undefined.
