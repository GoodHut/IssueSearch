 URL : "https://github.com/Kaikat/Tamuyal/issues/14" TITLE : gomap caching issues BODY : it seems like moving from one city to another makes gomap confused. as in it caches the other city's map so when you move to the new city you get no map since it is using the old cached one. this is my guess. we need to find a way to know if the player loaded a valid map or not. if the player did not load a map for whatever reason, gomap should be forced to query mapzen for valid/relevant map data.
