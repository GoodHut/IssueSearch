 URL : "https://github.com/ConsoleTVs/Charts/issues/231" TITLE : groupby integer range ? BODY : i have a table containing the age of all my participants. i would like to display this in a pie chart, but rather than have a pie chart with 50+ ages. i would like to aggregate these into age groups so i would like to have a group 18 and under, 18-25, 26-34, 34-42, 42 and up is there a way to achieve this using the groupby?
