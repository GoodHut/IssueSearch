 URL : "https://github.com/delannoyk/AudioPlayer/issues/101" TITLE : wifi lost not restarting BODY : when starting the stream on wifi and then turning wifi off, the stream does not resume even with a full cell connection. this happens every time i run the app starting on wifi. starting from a cell connection and then going back and forth between wifi/cell works as expected every time. this might be relevant to 87 . could this be an avplayer bug or are we missing a case somewhere?
