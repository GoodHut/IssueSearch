 URL : "https://github.com/summernote/summernote/issues/2616" TITLE : dynamically change lang BODY : i use summernote in my single page app, that has a button to dynamically change the app's language; so i need to dynamically set the lang for the editor too, but i've found no better way than destroying it and re-creating by calling $ editor .materialnote 'destroy' ; $ editor .materialnote this.options ; which is very slow, especially with multiple editor instances; is there a better way to do that?
