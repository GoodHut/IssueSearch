 URL : "https://github.com/Netflix/vizceral/issues/101" TITLE : ordered message flows BODY : vizceral currently shows messages travelling with various velocities, thus arriving out-of-order. when visualizing systems that preserve ordering it'd be nice to show the particles arriving in-order. the easiest way would be to give particles a constant velocity, which would probably be a matter of making the velocity randomization in https://github.com/netflix/vizceral/blob/master/src/base/connectionview.js l108 conditional.
