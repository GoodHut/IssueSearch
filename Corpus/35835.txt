 URL : "https://github.com/bpellin/keepassdroid/issues/194" TITLE : file not found error BODY : i'm running android 7.1.1 on a nexus 6p, and i cannot open my keepass database; i keep getting a file not found error when i try. i'm currently on version 2.0.6.4. this is not a new thing; i've never gotten it to work at all. i've switched away from passwordsafe on everything but my phone because i've been unable to get this app to work. i'm syncing my database with syncthing, rather than dropbox or any other cloud solution, and locating the file with astro file manager.
