 URL : "https://github.com/dkniffin/mtg-horde/issues/22" TITLE : buffs and counters BODY : it's really tiresome to keep track of all the counters and buffs on the horde's creatures. to alleviate that, we should add some data for each card for counters ie: put a +1/+1 counter on target creature , permanent buffs ie: all other zombies get +1/+1 , and temporary buffs ie: target creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn . then, we can show the total power/toughness on the card, by adding the base and any counters.
