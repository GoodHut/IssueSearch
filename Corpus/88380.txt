 URL : "https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross/issues/1934" TITLE : new presenter for android BODY : the current android presenter is very limited. out of the box there is no support for fragments, dialogs, or other navigation patterns. to fix this we need to develop a new presenter which will replace the current one as default. the new presenter should support: - fragments nested - activity's - dialogs navigation patterns that should be easy to implement with this are: - navigationdrawer - bottomnavigationbar other requirements are: - support for native and appcompat views - handle tombstoning - easy usage of animations - closing of views as wel as showing - handling the backstack - caching fragments the plan is to implement it similar to the new ios presenter, were we have multiple view attributes to indicate how the view will be shown. also a interface can be implemented to customize view behaviour at runtime.
