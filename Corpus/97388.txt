 URL : "https://github.com/cginternals/gloperate/issues/351" TITLE : gl_invalid_enum at startup BODY : right after startup the following error appears exactly 6 times on cerr: fatal: error: 0x500, high severity api gl_invalid_enum error generated. <pname> requires feature s disabled in the current profile. after some searching, i found that these errors are produced by glcontextutils::retrieveformat . it seems that gl_red_bits through gl_stencil_bits are not part of the opengl 4.5 specification anymore see lists in 4.5 glget reference https://www.khronos.org/registry/opengl-refpages/gl4/html/glget.xhtml and 2.1 glget reference https://www.khronos.org/registry/opengl-refpages/gl2.1/xhtml/glget.xml i haven't noticed any negative impact yet, but i also don't know where these values are required at the moment. neither do i know, why the exact same code previously ran without generating the error messages. they started showing up after merging 327.
