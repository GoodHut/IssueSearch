 URL : "https://github.com/opensourceBIM/BIMserver/issues/670" TITLE : query plugin development BODY : hi, as we can't use the bimql plugin anymore, i planned to develop my own query plugin. i tried to make an hello world query plugin but i can't find the correct json request to call my plugin. it seems that in old version of bimserver the download method had a downloadtype parameter that is not used anymore. can you help me ? by the way, according to your wiki page https://github.com/opensourcebim/bimserver/wiki/deprecated query-plugin-interface , can you confirm that it's useless to try to develop a query plugin or a new interface for query plugin development is planned? thank you
