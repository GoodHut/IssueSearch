 URL : "https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-server/issues/696" TITLE : couple of questions BODY : hi, i'm currently implementing a oauth2 server using your library and i'm just wondering if there is any point in storing the expiry date and scopes of tokens/codes. from what i can see the data is never used by the library. the repositories only checks if the tokens/codes are revoked.
