BODY : previously i used sublimetext with plugin plaintasks https://github.com/aziz/plaintasks . todo+ right now have no useful features, such add datetime stamp when task done/canceled, archive mode. last feature really cool, it allow often not use scroll of screen to show all undone tasks, because all completed tasks you can send in archive by simple command or keys combination and keep you lists actual.
