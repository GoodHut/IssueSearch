 URL : "https://github.com/OpenRiskNet/home/issues/6" TITLE : dashboard for users BODY : we need some form of dashboard that the end users will see as the landing page for an orn vre. this would list all the relevant resources that are available apps, docs, support etc. . whilst we will probably initially just use a static html page for this that is updated when things change we need to look into something more dynamic that automatically updates when new apps are deployed or undeployed. maybe we can do this with a dashboard similar to the new openshift service catalog which does the same thing for an openshift cluster from a developer's perspective - see here https://blog.openshift.com/whats-new-in-openshift-3-7-service-catalog-and-brokers/ by means of annotating/labelling the applications in an appropriate way. in this way the dashboard would dynamically update. but this needs thought and discussion. for sure there needs to the ability for a vre administrator to radically change the look and contents of the page. please use this issue to discuss this topic and identify other matters that need to be considered.
