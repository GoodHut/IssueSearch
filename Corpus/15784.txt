 URL : "https://github.com/BlakeGuilloud/ganon/issues/546" TITLE : fix sortby method BODY : there is currently a method called sortby that lives in /lib/sortby.js . it is incomplete and needs to be fixed! sortby takes in two arguments. the first is a sorting function. a, b => a > b the second argument is the array you wish to sort. acceptance criteria: 1. running yarn test <methodname> results in tests passing. 2. you have written a skeleton method for someone else to work on. 3. you have written tests surrounding your skeleton method. 4. running yarn lint does not print any errors to the console! 5. optional: write one or two more tests surrounding the method you are solving to account for potential edge cases. please include the skeleton of a new method + an accompanying test for someone else to work on at the time of creating a pull request! a pull request will most likely be denied if it does not contain a skeleton method for someone else to work on! for more information, please read the contributing guide https://github.com/blakeguilloud/ganon/blob/master/contributing.md . thank you so much for your contribution!
