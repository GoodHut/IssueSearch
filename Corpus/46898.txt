 URL : "https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/6159" TITLE : neovim embed freezing BODY : - nvim --version : nvim v0.2.0-624-gddab466, v0.1.6 as well. - vim version: 7.6.4 behaves differently? kinda, with netbeans embedding, this isn't a problem. - operating system/version: macos sierra, windows 7 - terminal name/version: python, both 2 and 3 with both asyncio and pyuv backends. actual behaviour neovim msgrpc commands hang if you're in the middle of a multi-key command like gg and try to run another command like feedkeys g , eval , feedkeys g will hang on the eval forever . many vim inputs do this. it happens with feedkeys, input, and request 'vim_input', key . for what it's worth, i didn't have this problem with the netbeans embed. expected behaviour no hangs when i run msgpack api commands during input i've embedded neovim as an input plugin in another sublime text, so i'm not just the remote ui blindly . steps to reproduce import neovim n = neovim.attach 'child', argv= '/usr/local/bin/nvim', '--embed' print 'input' n.feedkeys 'g' print 'eval' n.eval 'mode ' print 'input' n.feedkeys 'g'
