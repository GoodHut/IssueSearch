 URL : "https://github.com/DSheirer/sdrtrunk/issues/100" TITLE : patch group streaming BODY : hi, i have a talkgroup set up to stream to an icecast server, using the code updated yesterday. this talkgroup is normally part of a patch group, in the control channels event log the alias is logged correctly next to the patch group calls, but the majority of the time the voice channel doesn't display the alias, and its not streamed, but audio comes out of the local speakers correctly. the same streaming setup works correctly with a standalone talkgroup.
