 URL : "https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/5001" TITLE : crystal and webassembly? BODY : please feel free to just close the issue whenever it fits. i had a look at this website lately: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/webassembly/c_to_wasm now - it's c/c++ to webassembly but i was thinking ... why not with crystal? would this be possible, in theory? i really have absolutely no idea . perhaps it could be put into a crystal faq or so. it probably is a very, very, very low priority but ... anything else but javascript on the www sounds like a win to me.
