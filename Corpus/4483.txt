 URL : "https://github.com/johnros/chords/issues/1" TITLE : data qc issues BODY : hi @johnros a few things i ran into when using chords on some real data 1. network sizes in real data unfortunately may be nan or na - a quick check will catch these. 2. sometimes coupon ids are numbers, and so should be converted with as.character before any further processing to avoid oddities due to indexing. although it's not really qc, given that chords doesn't' use things like the coupons, is it necessary to have initializerdsobject? why not just call estimate.b.k with arguments corresponding to the interview time and the degree?
