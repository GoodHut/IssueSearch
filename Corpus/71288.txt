 URL : "https://github.com/jmeas/api-pls/issues/233" TITLE : add built-in auth system BODY : many authorization systems use the same approach: - atomic actions; used by programs - groups of actions; used by users to assign auth to users i.e.; a manager can do a series of atomic actions this system could likely just come out-of-the-box with this so that you can just set it all up declaratively.
