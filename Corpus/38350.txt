 URL : "https://github.com/MasterEx/jupar/issues/1" TITLE : patch for downloader BODY : hi, if you are interested, i fixed for myself two issues: 1 downloaderxmlparserhandler: i had a longer list of files to download, and this failed after some files, because of a truncated filename i.e. the url was cropped . after having a look at downloaderxmlparserhandler, i figured out that the ch array in characters was full, and the rest of the filename came with the next call of characters. i fixed this by caching the value from characters until endelement is called. 2 the second one was more a convenience fix, i changed the copy function in update so that it checks if destination is a directory, and if to append the filename to the destination. with that, you can now just give the destination directory in the move instruction. best regards jan-patrick jupar.zip https://github.com/masterex/jupar/files/1092155/jupar.zip
