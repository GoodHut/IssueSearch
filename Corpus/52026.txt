 URL : "https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/2707" TITLE : can one disable eqany? BODY : https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/6elim6/announcing_dotty_012rc1_a_major_step_towards/dik7j1b/ points out that this code compiles, unlike i would have expected: scala import dotty.dottypredef.{eqany => _, _} import scala.{eq => _, _} object main { def equal s, t s: s, t: t = s == t } the second import tried to prevent the eq instance from being found. but using -xprint:all suggests eq instances don't come into play. i suspect something like this should be a testcase. i don't know what should be the way to disable eqany , but i do think it should be possible and that seems the appropriate syntax. in particular, this example appears to contradict this quote from https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/1247: > the idea is that the scala compiler will check every time it encounters a potentially problematic comparison between values of types t and u that there is an implicit instance of eq t, u . a comparison is potentially problematic if it is between incompatible types. as long as t <: u or u <: t the equality could make sense because both sides can potentially be the same value. this bug and 2698 might need to be fixed in cooperation.
