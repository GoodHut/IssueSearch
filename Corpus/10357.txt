 URL : "https://github.com/svinota/pyroute2/issues/331" TITLE : can't add a rule BODY : when i try to add a new rule: ipdb.rules.add table=252, priority=63001 .commit i get the error: struct.error: required argument is not an integer which is due to the following command in pyroute2/ipdb/rule.py, rule.commit , around line 143: self.nl.rule 'del', priority=old_key i'm not sure why it's trying to delete any rules with the priority of the new rule, if i remove this line everything seems to work fine. thanks, charles
