 URL : "https://github.com/johannesjo/angular-promise-buttons/issues/43" TITLE : es6 promises not working BODY : i'm currently using es6 with my angular 1.5.x code. the promise button library is failing to resolve the promises because of this code block. mval.finally function { promisedone = true; handleloadingfinished btnel ; } ; mval.finally is not a function with native es6 promises. i noticed in your angular 2 version, you check for finally and then have a fallback. if promise.finally { promise.finally resolveloadingstate ; } else { promise .then resolveloadingstate .catch resolveloadingstate ; } is it possible to have this approach included into this repo as well.
