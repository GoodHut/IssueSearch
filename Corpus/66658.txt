 URL : "https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/549" TITLE : network compile for iot BODY : it would be really great to be able to cross-compile for iot & low-power devices using the network. any machine reachable by standard ssh has the ability to run commands and to send files. it's obviously a power-user feature but it'd be nice to be able to register another local pc as a build box, have a process to confirm viability does it have ssh can we access that using credentials supplied run a script to check tools are available tarball the source folders transfer via scp untar on remote machine build package build artifacts send build artifacts back to iot device
