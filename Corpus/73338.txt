 URL : "https://github.com/adamcooke/send_file_with_range/issues/3" TITLE : crashes with large files BODY : while creating a local media server, i have run into a few situations whereby my whole system would crash and would need to hard rebooting when trying to read large files. i have solved this by introducing a buffer size option which you can pass through like so: ruby send_file_with_range @path, type: 'video/mp4', disposition: 'inline', range: true, buffer_size: 100_000 code can be found on my fork here https://github.com/tom-sherman/send_file_with_range/blob/1c70e22faf66232cbac2f0967335be44872e4080/lib/send_file_with_range/controller_extension.rb . let me know if this is something you'd like to include in this gem and i can clean up my code and submit a pr. cheers!
