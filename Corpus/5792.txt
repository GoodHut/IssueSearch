BODY : what is the purpose of this repo? yes to study, and thats cool are you intending to delete the repo after the test? if not, just make the repo sup. no point in having to do extra work and the bonus is that if you ever needed this repo, e.g. for a job interview, a you don't look like a derp trying to explain its purpose and why they should look at it, and b you can reuse it in the unlikely chance you need a rectangle .
