 URL : "https://github.com/elastic/logstash/issues/6991" TITLE : ls monitoring ui docs page BODY : our logstash docs don't currently link to or mention the monitoring ui. my proposal would be to have a top level monitoring section that encompasses a new monitoring ui page which can link off to the relevant x-pack docs and the monitoring api endpoints and response payloads. /cc @dedemorton
