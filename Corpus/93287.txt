 URL : "https://github.com/RafaelSalguero/CSharp2TS/issues/12" TITLE : add option to omit members BODY : since most popular use-case of the extension is to just convert dtos, i think it can be useful to omit some members on the conversion like private/internal members, methods, simple backing field properties. i don't really think it is good to place all these things into dto in the first place, but i'm sure that this will have some use-cases.
