 URL : "https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/4745" TITLE : insert is slow BODY : hi, i created a 6 node cluster _3 tikv, 3 pd with tidb runs on same 2 vms, latest bits_ and created a single table with 2 columns, keyname & keyvalue, both are varchar 50 & 100 . i connect to this cluster thru mysql .net connector from a separate machine and execute ‘insert into..’ statements through mysqlcommand.executenonquery . i observe that each insert takes ~45-60 milliseconds to finish. looks slow to me but like to know the performance others see. can you please let me know whether this performance is correct? i ran a second scenario, where i concat all the ‘insert into..’ lines together _10,000 records at a time_ and sent it via same .executenonquery . this time the command never returns. but when i run ‘select count ..’ thru mysql terminal i get the record counts for some time. from that i can see that the cluster inserts ~40 records per second and eventually that command also yields connection timeout. can you please point me to the performance numbers you’ve published, if any, so i can validate mine against yours? thank you
