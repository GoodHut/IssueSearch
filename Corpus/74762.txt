 URL : "https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/544" TITLE : file not working offline BODY : i have a video on my app built with create-react-native-app and i'm using the video component of expo.io . i am displaying a local video, and on my application this is working when connected to the internet, but when the app is offline the video does not play/work/load. here is my project structure: app.js app.json node_modules yarn.lock app.test.js images package.json readme.md my-app-key.keystore videos here is the code for the video player component: import react, { component } from 'react'; import { stylesheet, text, view, image, button } from 'react-native'; import { video } from 'expo'; class player extends component { constructor props { super props ; } render { return <video source={require './videos/asthma-1.mp4' } //local video rate={1.0} volume={1.0} muted={false} usenativecontrols resizemode= cover shouldplay islooping style={{ width: 900, height: 450, position:'relative',left:350,bottom:410 }} /> } } what am i doing wrong? why is the video being delivered online but not offline? i am using it on an android device btw edit: also, i noticed that the images located in the image folder work both offline and online. did i structure/name my videos folder incorrectly for that not to load offline?
