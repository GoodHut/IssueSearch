 URL : "https://github.com/symfony/webpack-encore/issues/136" TITLE : consider reverting 110 BODY : versionning may be disabled at the user choice. encore shouldn't ignore this choice to fix a technical naming issue. for the final user, getting the bad file, may be better than no file at all think about favicon.ico for instance . and imo it shouldn't be a choice made be encore for you. please consider other alternatives like using the path when versioning is disabled or using a hash based on the filepath instead of the file content
