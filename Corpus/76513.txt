 URL : "https://github.com/tamasflamich/effort/issues/71" TITLE : lazy loading not working BODY : lazy loading does not seem to be working with effort. the asp.net controller i am trying to test is relying on lazy loading and works correctly. however my unit test for the controller is failing, because lazy loading is not working when i am using my context with effort. i am using ef 6.1.3 and effort 1.3.0. is there something i have to do in the configuration of effort or otherwise to get this to work in my unit tests? or is this a known limitation?
