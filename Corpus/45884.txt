 URL : "https://github.com/ttscoff/nv/issues/452" TITLE : is this project dead? BODY : there have been no commits to this repo since may of 2015 nearly two years ago , but the last updates to nvalt2 came via auto-update in november. the post by @ttscoff indicated that they were working on a tool called bitwriter http://brettterpstra.com/2016/09/22/nvalt-2-dot-2-bugfixes-sierra-compatibility/ , which will presumably be a non-oss app as i don't see a public repo for the development . i am assuming that's why there have been no more commits to this public repo, as they are reserving their work for bitwriter. i have no issue with making a product out of this, but can we at least get the latest code for nvalt committed to this repo so we as a community can continue to work on it?
