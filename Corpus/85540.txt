 URL : "https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura/issues/2745" TITLE : fedora 26, appimage 3.0.4 BODY : cura from the repository works fine but i want to use 3.0.4 with the cr 10 settings. running the appimage from a different computer xubuntu 14.04 works fine. but from on my fedora 26 it starts to load then crashes as soon as the user agreement starts to come up. i never actually see the user agreement i just know from watching the other system run the appimage that it's the user agreement that crashes. don't see any kind of warning, just kills off. running from the terminal gives this output: fontconfig error: /etc/fonts/conf.d/10-scale-bitmap-fonts.conf , line 72: non-double matrix element fontconfig error: /etc/fonts/conf.d/10-scale-bitmap-fonts.conf , line 72: non-double matrix element fontconfig warning: /etc/fonts/conf.d/10-scale-bitmap-fonts.conf , line 80: saw unknown, expected number fontconfig warning: /etc/fonts/conf.d/65-0-lohit-bengali.conf , line 32: unknown element langset fontconfig warning: /etc/fonts/conf.d/69-gnu-free-sans.conf , line 24: unknown element langset fontconfig warning: /etc/fonts/conf.d/69-gnu-free-serif.conf , line 24: unknown element langset qobject::connect: parentheses expected, signal mainwindow:: qobject::connect: parentheses expected, signal mainwindow:: qobject::connect: parentheses expected, signal mainwindow:: qobject::connect: parentheses expected, signal mainwindow:: file:///tmp/.mount_uzb2us/usr/bin/resources/themes/cura-light/styles.qml:197:17: qml item: binding loop detected for property width qml: tableviewselection: index out of range qml: tableviewselection: index out of range file:///tmp/.mount_uzb2us/usr/bin/plugins/plugins/um3networkprinting/discoverum3action.qml:282: typeerror: cannot read property 'clustersize' of null ./bin//cura.sh: line 11: 11489 segmentation fault core dumped cura $@
