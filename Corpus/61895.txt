 URL : "https://github.com/FormidableLabs/rapscallion/issues/115" TITLE : build without bluebird? BODY : bluebird is a promise library, and most of that work is for client-side functionality. i'm wanting to use your package server-side only, and we already are on node 6+ which supports promises, not too mention we have our own promise shim.. . any chance of removing that dependency. . . ?
