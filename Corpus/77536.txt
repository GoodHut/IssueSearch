 URL : "https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii/issues/1050" TITLE : new version notification BODY : as of right now the only way, that i know of, to see if there is a new version of firefly iii is to check the github releases page. it would be nice to have some kind of notification within firefly iii to notify the user/admin to update firefly. for example when there is a new version released there could be a bar across the top of the page notifying the user of the new version with links to the github releases page or the wiki update instructions.
