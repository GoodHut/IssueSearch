BODY : when i did support of this library's v1.0 within pg-promise , i had to add a hack code injection for the read operation in order to pull such basic information as the number of rows that went through the stream. now with version 1.1, do i have to write a new hack for it or is there now a more civilized approach to getting the number of rows once the streaming has finished?
