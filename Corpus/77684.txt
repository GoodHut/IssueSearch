 URL : "https://github.com/json-schema-faker/json-schema-faker/issues/238" TITLE : not generating null type BODY : currently the schema faker is not creating null values for generated data. eg http://json-schema-faker.js.org/ gist/9d8805b05b10f4da5dc920f5c0b9a092 this should create an object that includes isoverseas property every time, but it does not. it seems that type null is being interpreted as the property should not be generated at all but that is incorrect. result i get: { addressline1 : aliquip proident } result i expected: { isoverseas : null, addressline1 : aliquip proident }
