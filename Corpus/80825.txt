 URL : "https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/2390" TITLE : upgrading with terraform BODY : the upgrading docs https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/upgrade.md mentions that changing the kubernetes version would require a rolling update. i was wondering what happens if i change the k8s version, get the terraform output and do terraform apply . will this do a rolling update? any chance that i will lose state?
