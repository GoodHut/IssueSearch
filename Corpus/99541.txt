 URL : "https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/issues/247" TITLE : more lenient arrival zones BODY : problem: a user is navigating to the mall. they arrive at the mall and begin to park their car in the parking lot. however, since the user did not reach the destination marker due to it being in the middle of the mall , we reroute them. ideas on how to fix: if the users uses the geocoder to find a destination, use it's bounding box if available to see if the user is inside the bounding box. use run time styling to see if user is less then x meters away from destination and in inside a parking lot. ask the user have you arrived at the mall? before rerouting when near the destination. /cc @mapbox/navigation
