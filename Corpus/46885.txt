 URL : "https://github.com/emberjs/ember-data-fixture-adapter/issues/16" TITLE : need to wrap response BODY : i'm using ember and ember data both 2.15.0, and i needed to wrap the response of the fixtureadapter methods in order for them to be recognised by the calling method from the ember data store? and processed into real ember.models. eg: // app/adapters/post.js import fixtureadapter from 'ember-data-fixture-adapter'; export default fixtureadapter.extend { simulateremoteresponse: false, findall: function { return this._super.apply this, arguments .then function response { return { posts: response }; } ; } } ; i'm using a restserializer, if that matters, but i can't see how. is this intentional? or perhaps caused by changes to ember data? i'm currently upgrading from ember 1.13 to 2.15. the exact same fixtures and models worked fine in 1.13 using the built-in ds.fixtureadapter, without needing to wrap the responses.
