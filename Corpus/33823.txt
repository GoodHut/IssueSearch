from: @_vzaliva i temporary switched back to 8.4 branch, so i could not test this example with most recent svn, but i am attaching a code which is couple days old. in last lemma 'apply ar' was 'assumption' under 8.4 as described in the original report. bugzilla comment id: 10461

from: @_aspiwack i'm guessing it's a case of implicit arguments in ar being convertible but not syntactically equal to the implicit arguments in the conclusion. and therefore not a bug. can you confirm? bugzilla comment id: 11901

from: @_ppedrot in absence of further answer, and following arnaud's comment, i close this bug.
