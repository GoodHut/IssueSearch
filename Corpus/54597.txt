 URL : "https://github.com/binji/binjgb/issues/8" TITLE : graphics bug in sagaia BODY : when you fly down the screen, there is a spot where the window fills the entire screen. the issue is that the ly=lyc interrupt should be firing, but isn't. the strange thing is that normally the code sets the lyc value to something below the current ly value. when it screws up, it sets lyc to the current ly value. this should fire an interrupt, but it seems to be blocked by the internal stat interrupt flag already being set see stat_irq_blocking in mooneye-gb . maybe i'm setting it wrong.
