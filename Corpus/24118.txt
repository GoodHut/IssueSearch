 URL : "https://github.com/CatalystCode/radial-menu/issues/136" TITLE : semo circular menu BODY : how easy / difficult would it be for this control to support a semi circle rather than a full circle to host the items ? i am thinking of using this in a camera application and it would be cool to have this instead of buttons all over.
