 URL : "https://github.com/SourceKettle/sourcekettle/issues/489" TITLE : long task review screen BODY : it would be helpful to a full details task view to enable the bulk reviewing of tasks. i suggest adding a full task single column view to https://sourcekettle.ecs.soton.ac.uk/project/storyplacesaurelia/tasks/?statuses=&priorities=&types=&assignees=&creators=&milestones=674 the original report from chris g is here: when we are reviewing tasks to put them into milestones or reviewing the end of a milestone it would be useful to have the list of tasks in a different template. specifically, not in 3rd width swim lanes. maybe even most of the task card from https://sourcekettle.ecs.soton.ac.uk/project/drupal-2017/tasks/view/2 but if in a milestone, showing with section headings... maybe something a bit more like rt. the reason is that we have to click on each task to remind ourselves of the details, and that means jumping around and losing context.
