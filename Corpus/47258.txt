 URL : "https://github.com/mckeever02/tryingtowork/issues/2" TITLE : opening times are off BODY : in this blog post you mention dynamically showing the opening times using liquid: https://mckvr.com/jekyll/liquid/2017/05/15/displaying-opening-times-in-jekyll/ with this approach aren't the times only true at the time of the last build? for this to be truly dynamic, wouldn't you want that logic in javascript. maybe use liquid to generate a json list of locations, then use the filter function to get the desired results.
