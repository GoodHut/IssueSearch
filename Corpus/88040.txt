 URL : "https://github.com/threema-ch/threema-web/issues/59" TITLE : missing mime-type for apk BODY : when sending an apk file via the web-client, the mime type of the file is marked as application/octet-stream instead of application/vnd.android.package-archive . this is annoying because android doesn't handle these files as apk-files. the mime-type is set correctly when using the threema app on android directly, so it has to be a web-client issue. tested on chrome 56, macos 10.12
