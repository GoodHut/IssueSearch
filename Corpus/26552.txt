BODY : i'm testing out a new ble/nfc/usb u2f device, and so far i've had no luck with ble on macos. just pairing the device seems to be tricky; macos does not show ble devices in their gui. ! screen shot 2017-01-13 at 4 34 29 pm https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7232674/21949935/2d1fae56-d9c4-11e6-9096-07cf107cc6d7.png after fiddling around with apple's bluetooth explorer, i finally got the device paired with the correct passcode and it stays connected for a few seconds. by design the device will power off after a few seconds. ! screen shot 2017-01-13 at 6 59 45 pm https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7232674/21950036/f17a2b8c-d9c4-11e6-9ecc-8a4b737b0e04.png ! screen shot 2017-01-13 at 7 08 17 pm https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7232674/21949882/ba09d2f2-d9c3-11e6-9185-13d2a20e7f48.png if i try to use the sample server in chrome, it never seems to attempt/connect over bluetooth. the u2f device was previously paired via usb. ! image https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7232674/21948941/567a2bd0-d9bc-11e6-9ca7-131a61ab7370.png any ideas @jovasco or @juanlang? do you think this is a u2f-ref-code or chromium/chrome problem?
