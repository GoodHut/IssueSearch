 URL : "https://github.com/iridium-browser/tracker/issues/157" TITLE : disable profile button BODY : i believe this has already been requested and implemented in the past https://github.com/iridium-browser/tracker/issues/41 , however the patch has been broken for a while now, the profile button https://i.imgur.com/koraxug.png is showing once again, and the --disable-new-avatar-menu flag is long gone. it would be awesome if this feature could somehow be reimplemented.
