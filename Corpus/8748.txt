 URL : "https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/issues/229" TITLE : rest api issues BODY : the following settings all return null instead of a value: cache_mobile_browsers - lists the mobile browsers when mobile device support is enabled. cache_mobile_prefixes - lists the mobile prefixes when mobile device support is enabled. cache_mutex_disabled - coarse file locking setting. cache_hello_world - proudly tell the world your server is stephen fry proof setting. cache_gzencode - shows a warning that compression is disabled if gzencode function was not found. cache_disable_locking - show / hide coarse file locking setting. cache_readonly - shows a warning that the cache path is not read-only. cache_writable - shows a warning that the cache path is currently writable. the following settings are missing from the api: cache_gc_email_me - email me when the garbage collection runs setting. cache_schedule_interval - value of interval setting when clock scheduling is enabled. cache_next_gc - value of next scheduled garbage collection . accepted_files - accepted filenames. rejected_uri - rejected uris. rejected_user_agent - rejected user agents. lock_down - flag that determines what text is displayed in the lock down section. cache_direct_pages - directly cached files. http_only - this setting is used for the cache tester functionality on the easy tab and should return a default value of true . _cache stats_ for caching stats, cached_list and expired_list for both supercache and wpcache are objects where age is the key. could we return these as an array of objects instead where each object has the following structure: { age: 1000, uri: donnapep.wpsandbox.me/blog/blah } _cache type_ is_super_cache_enabled is always returned as false by the api regardless of what caching type is selected. the strange thing is that the test harness does return the correct value, but the network request in calypso does not. _saving_ posting data does not work at all.
