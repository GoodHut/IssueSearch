 URL : "https://github.com/sensebox/openSenseMap/issues/247" TITLE : rain gauge 24h values BODY : good morning, first of all thank you for offering opensensemap. i started using it approx. 2 month ago when i build my first air quality sensor. as i recently started working more with arduino i was thinking of writing rain gauge measurements to opensensemap. e. g. in 5 minute intervals. but often the rain ammount for the last 24 hours is more interesting. as i don't want to leave the data that long on the esp8266 in case of some quirks i think maybe we could get something like a sum up function for sensor values to osm. but i've no idea how cumbersome such a feature is to build. i also considered writing this data to my own shared hosting environment and visualize it with d3.js or maybe even rrdtool - but for me that's not as easy as i thought... greetings eike
