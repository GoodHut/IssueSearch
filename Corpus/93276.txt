 URL : "https://github.com/webcompat/webcompat.com/issues/1448" TITLE : add npm build to npm start BODY : as a lot of new contributors forget the npm run build step and file issues or ping on the channel, because the css files are missing. to help and make the setup steps simpler, it seems like a good idea to put npm run build in one of the steps. as running the build before starting the server makes sense, i'd suggest to put it here https://github.com/webcompat/webcompat.com/blob/master/package.json l51 . what do you think?
