 URL : "https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/issues/277" TITLE : ledstate improvement BODY : ledstate 8 - led on when mqtt is connected. the led is on when everything is ok: wifi connected and mqtt is connected. when the user see that the led is on he knows that the system works normal. i fixed this adding setled syscfg.mqtt_enabled && mqttclient.connected ; in the loop, but having it as a configuration option will be better.
