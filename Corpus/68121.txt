 URL : "https://github.com/ros/robot_state_publisher/issues/79" TITLE : remove dependency on tf BODY : it looks like robot_state_publisher already uses tf2 for publishing transforms, but depends on tf so it can use tf::resolve on a frame given a tf_prefix. removing the tf dependency would required dropping support for tf_prefix which was removed in tf2 http://wiki.ros.org/tf2/migration tf_and_tf2 , and would break abi compatibility https://github.com/ros/robot_state_publisher/blob/530bba1d7001afb2d61dea6c52b966111f927f20/include/robot_state_publisher/robot_state_publisher.h l79 so it should be done no sooner than ros melodic.
