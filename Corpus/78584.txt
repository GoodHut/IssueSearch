 URL : "https://github.com/jiren/filter.js/issues/159" TITLE : question about filtering BODY : first of all thank you for this great example of client side filtering. there are so many useful ways to use this concept. in one of the examples bytepartners , i saw a different use of adding filters. instead of .addcriteria, i see .addfilter, and it seems to be behaving different. within the same filtering group, the filter elements are considered as they have and between them, instead of or. in other words, the checkboxes are behaving like radio buttons. i am wondering if it's this section where i need to make modifications to correct the issue: var include = true; while f-- && include { var filter = filters f ; if typeof urlfilters filter.key == 'undefined' { urlfilters filter.key = filter.value; } else if urlfilters filter.key .indexof filter.value === -1 { urlfilters filter.key += ',' + filter.value; } if item filter.key .constructor === array { if item filter.key .includes filter.value { continue; } else { include = false; } } any assistance is much appreciated.
