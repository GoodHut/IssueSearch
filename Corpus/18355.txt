 URL : "https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk/issues/524" TITLE : swap uuid library BODY : we use https://github.com/nu7hatch/gouuid. last commit more than 3 years ago, lacking many useful features like uuid.bytes . let's use https://github.com/satori/go.uuid instead. actually maintained, much more popular and with many more features, including the method above. we can still use uuid v4 as specified by rfc 4122, so there should be no changes in behaviour. some code would get simpler too. can do this myself if there are no objections. /cc @buger @lonelycode
