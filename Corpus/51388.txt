 URL : "https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/issues/1658" TITLE : aliased crates hidden. BODY : i have a prelude that includes pub extern crate imageflow_types as s; . while everything compiles, s:: does not autocomplete or allow go-to-definition. ::imageflow_types:: does. i'm pretty sure this used to work at one point. imageflow_types is a crate within my opened workspace.
