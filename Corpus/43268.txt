 URL : "https://github.com/blue-yonder/pyscaffold/issues/116" TITLE : consider dropping pbr BODY : newer versions of setuptools allow configuration with the help of setup.cfg for almost all options. a few years ago this was not possible and therefore pbr was used to achieve this. pbr itself is considered by many people as quite a hack and it is really hard to debug sometimes. for version 3.0 of pyscaffold we could consider dropping pbr and replacing it with the standard functionality of more recent versions of setuptools. checkout the setuptools' documentation http://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html configuring-setup-using-setup-cfg-files for more details.
