 URL : "https://github.com/splatlab/cqf/issues/5" TITLE : compiling with gcc 6.2 BODY : i ran into two problems with gcc 6.2 on our hpc -- cc1plus: error: invalid option argument ‘-ofast’ cc1plus: error: unrecognized command line option -std=c++11 and gqf.c: in function ‘void qf_multi_merge qf , int, qf ’: gqf.c:1593: error: ‘uint64_max’ was not declared in this scope and eventually figured out this set of fixes: https://github.com/dib-lab/khmer/issues/1775 issuecomment-339983501 i don't think anything needs to be done here, and this may be for an old version of the cqf anyway we're on github.com/dib-lab/khmer commit 1c2810cb, and the cqf code is under third-party/cqf/ fyi , but i wanted to link the problem and its fix into this repo.
