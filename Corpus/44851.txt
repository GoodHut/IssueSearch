BODY : sometime we have a long function call like: swift something.callsomefunction arg1: anywaytogenerateparam , arg2: anotherparam, arg3: averylongparam so, i want to break it to multiple lines: swift something.callsomefunction arg1: anywaytogenerateparam , arg2: anotherparam, arg3: averylongparam in old swimat with xcode 7 , it's awesome. but in the extension branch with xcode 8 , the args are always align with the parentheses: swift something.callsomefunction arg1: anywaytogenerateparam , arg2: anotherparam, arg3: averylongparam i suggest that if the first argument and called in the same line, then all others will align with it. otherwise, all args will indent 4 spaces. formatted example: swift something.callsomefunction arg1: anywaytogenerateparam , // in the same line arg2: anotherparam, // align with first argument arg3: averylongparam // or something.callsomefunction arg1: anywaytogenerateparam , // always indent 4 spaces none of the parentheses arg2: anotherparam, arg3: averylongparam
