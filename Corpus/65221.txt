 URL : "https://github.com/wagtail/bakerydemo/issues/120" TITLE : improve inline comments BODY : feedback from holland was that some of the code is slightly hard to follow, especially if someone isn't used to django. in the longer term i think there was a discussion about creating some form of tutorial to help better introduce the project, but in the interim adding/ improving the inline comments feels like a good first step.
