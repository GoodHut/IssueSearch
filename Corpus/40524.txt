 URL : "https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-wpilib/issues/276" TITLE : update code for 2018 BODY : this is a broad issue, to just be a pointer to something that needs to get done. for those of you new to this project, every year we have to update robotpy's source code to match whatever changes they made to wpilib. it's a bit time consuming and a very manual process, and last year i think it took us about a month to do it. we have some tools that help out with this, if you're interested in helping out then check out our porting guide at http://robotpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/dev/porting.html . if the instructions don't make sense, please comment here so we can update them.
