 URL : "https://github.com/gbv/Catmandu-PICA/issues/52" TITLE : invalid characters in xml BODY : i just came across a problem with character ranges below 0x20, which are present in initial plain pica files. catmandu perfectly converts them to pica xml, but by doing so catmandu actually generates invalid xml files, which cannot be parsed by xsl processors. example file one record in plain pica, field 233p contains the unicode character 0x2 record.txt https://github.com/gbv/catmandu-pica/files/1467364/record.txt command catmandu convert -v pica --type binary to pica --type xml < record.txt > record.xml the resulting xml cannot be transformed e.g. to solr xml via xmlstarlet, xsltproc or saxon he. for now i delete all characters which are not allowed in xml according to the specification https://www.w3.org/tr/xml/ charsets by using tr -d '\000-\010\013\014\016-\037' i wonder if catmandu should handle this problem and only generate valid xml. what do you think?
