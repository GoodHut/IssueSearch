 URL : "https://github.com/sumpfork/dominiontabs/issues/179" TITLE : custom divider option? BODY : i think everyone has their own personal twists on how they choose to divide the cards. there are also people who enjoy playing with fan-creations. would it be feasible to have an option for creating a few custom dividers, where the user can specify a card-type background, a cost, a name, a card-count, and text in the box? even if it, for example, required the user to create properly-formatted json and just point the back-end at it? otherwise it is an exercise in font-matching and self-measuring to get something that fits the nice look of the rest of the dividers.
