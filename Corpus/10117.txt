 URL : "https://github.com/joeroback/atom-clang/issues/32" TITLE : atom ide support BODY : a few days ago, atom ide was announced. it will be a more standardized way of adding ide functionality for a given language to atom. unfortunately, c++ is not one of the languages that will be receiving official support for this, at least for now. however, i believe that this package could become the go-to package for atom ide c++ support. this would also address the concern about linter, as atom ide comes with a brand new diagnostics section, which essentially replaces linter. if no one can work on this, i will try to take on this task, although i know next to nothing about developing for atom. i do know javascript/typescript and obviously a good deal of c++ so i should be able to figure things out. however, it would be for the best if someone with more knowledge of atom development could work on this.
