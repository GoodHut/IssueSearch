 URL : "https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer/issues/34" TITLE : hls play stuck BODY : when a peer subscribes to a hls stream, it starts to receive playlists and streams from that moment on. however, the playlist we stream contain information about segments in the past, which the subscriber will never be able to get because there is no requesting for a segment . this issue happens when multiple viewers subscribe to the same hls stream. we should address this issue by letting the viewer re-construct the playlist based on the segments it has at the moment, instead of relying on the playlist from the broadcaster.
