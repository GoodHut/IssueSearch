 URL : "https://github.com/EndlessCodeGroup/BukkitGradle/issues/12" TITLE : pluginmeta default values BODY : hello, it's me again. i notice that, you're implemented default values for metaitems in pluginmeta.groovy, but you are set these items as required. when you compile project without bukkit plugin meta, it will not compile and don't throw any error. wouldn't be better to set required to false?
