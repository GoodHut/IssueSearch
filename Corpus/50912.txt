 URL : "https://github.com/iconnect/regex/issues/37" TITLE : add escaping functions BODY : each backend should provide a function that will 'escape' strings to produce res that will match those strings. i don't think this is provided by regex-base so we will have to add functions in text.re.tdfa.re https://github.com/iconnect/regex/blob/master/text/re/tdfa/re.hs and text.re.pcre.re https://github.com/iconnect/regex/blob/master/text/re/pcre/re.hs to do this. thanks to @ezyang for the suggestion.
