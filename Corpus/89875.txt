 URL : "https://github.com/tsayen/dom-to-image/issues/93" TITLE : render node inside iframe BODY : i am trying to use dom-to-image to render a node which is within a iframe, but it does not work. i assume this is because you use window to get the style, while in an iframe you would need to use iframe.contentwindow. i think this could be solved by adding window as on option to overload the window used in the library. does that make sense?
