 URL : "https://github.com/instagrambot/instabot/issues/287" TITLE : unfollow doesn't work BODY : hello, i tried the script for a couple of weeks. everything works fine besides the bot.unfollow command. i am not sure but i think it worked some weeks ago. now i recognized that when i typ to unfollow either the user_id oder the username. it does not unfollow. there is no error log. may it be possible that instagram changed their api? thank you.
