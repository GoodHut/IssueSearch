 URL : "https://github.com/fsprojects/Paket/issues/2822" TITLE : frameworks vs framework BODY : in paket.dependencies, this worked before: frameworks: net45 but seems to fail with 1.0.6: paket failed with -> error in paket.dependencies line 1 could not parse framework 's'. try to update or install again or report a paket bug. it works if changed to: framework: net45 which makes sense i guess, if the property was changed, so feel free to close if by design.
