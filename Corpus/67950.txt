 URL : "https://github.com/klinker41/android-smsmms/issues/96" TITLE : read sms permission bug BODY : in some xiaomi devices, transactionservice is being started when the application is launched by the first time after installation. at that point the app wasn't able to request permissions to the user. the lack of enough permissions is resulting in an exception thrown by this service. i've made a pull request https://github.com/klinker41/android-smsmms/pull/95 with a fix proposal.
