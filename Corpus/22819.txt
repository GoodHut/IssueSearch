 URL : "https://github.com/brdude/pulp_centos_errata_import/issues/23" TITLE : mistake in section BODY : authentication pulp-admin must authenticate to pulp. this authentication information can be provided to pulp-admin in three ways. user certificate ~/.pulp/user-cert.pem recommended if you are using this script with katello, the foreman-installer creates a certificate suitable for use with pulp. you can use the cert by doing the following: shell sudo cat /etc/pki/katello/certs/pulp-client.crt /etc/pki/katello/private/pulp-client.key > ~/.pulp/user-cert.pem chown 400 ~/pulp/user-cert.pem - should be ~/.pulp/user-cert.pem
