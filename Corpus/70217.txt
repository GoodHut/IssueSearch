 URL : "https://github.com/BobSimons/erddap/issues/4" TITLE : use of cdm_feature_type BODY : if cdm_feature_type is a requirement for erddap, can we get rid of it in favor of featuretype ? we have been writing 'featuretype attributes into our netcdf files following this guidance http://cfconventions.org/data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.6/build/cf-conventions.html featuretype for cf-1.6 discrete sampling geometry dsg files. so for time series data, for example, we specify featuretype=timeseries' but we have also been writing cdm_data_type as it seems required by erddap. following unidata's apparent use of cdm_data_type we have been specifying cdm_data_type=station for time series data this is how cf-1.6 dsg files appear in toolsui, for example . erddap, however, apparently wants cdm_data_type to have the same values as featuretype and complains that station is not valid, suggesting it should be timeseries instead. @lesserwhirls, is there any reason for us to include cdm_data_type from a thredds perspective? if not, we would like to get rid of it in the future and just go with featuretype , and have it work in both thredds and erddap.
