 URL : "https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/issues/256" TITLE : help with installation!! BODY : @groue hi first off, thank you so much for such a wonderful and easy to use plugin for sqlite. i've particularly enjoyed using it and found to be much more simpler than other options available such as fmdb and swiftydb among others. though i was able to make it the integration work by following the steps outlined on your github page under manual section adding it as an embedded binary. i wanted to ask whether or not is possible to integrate grdb in the application that i'm working on by integrating swift files directly?
