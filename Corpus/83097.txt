 URL : "https://github.com/unruly/flick/issues/5" TITLE : browser can't be extended BODY : various dsl methods take a browser that gets passed to assertions and actions e.g. https://github.com/unruly/flick/blob/master/src/main/java/co/unruly/flick/dsl/actor.java l9 it would be useful to be able to extend the browser interface with additional functionality without having to modify flick itself. we could have <t extends browser> everywhere to allow binding to a more specific browser type. perhaps there's a better way.
