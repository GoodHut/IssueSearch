 URL : "https://github.com/arkayenro/arkinventory/issues/932" TITLE : odd sorting issue BODY : i prefer to sort my own items individually, and got ark mainly so i could customize and name bag slots. and to that end it works great. got all my slots named and all my items dropped in them. but i don't like it autosorting everything. i added a new sort method no sort , set it to user defined and then did not give it any definitions. i just left every sort order option unchecked. i then set every slot to be sorted according to no sort , which, in theory, would mean it had no sorting parameters and would do nothing. i also set all bags to ignore by restack. it is still resorting my items. i'm just trying to have no sort feature at all so i can move items around in my bags without it resetting their position them every time i close my inventory.
