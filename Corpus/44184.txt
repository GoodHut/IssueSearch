 URL : "https://github.com/magespecialist/m2-MSP_TwoFactorAuth/issues/8" TITLE : endless loop with duo BODY : i was trying to setup duo but after enabling i get to the screen with push/call/enter code and then i approve the push or enter the code and clicking continue takes me back to the push/call/enter code page. trying to access /admin panel redirects me there again - so i get locked until using the command line to disable 2fa.
