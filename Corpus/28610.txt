 URL : "https://github.com/linkyard/concourse-helm-resource/issues/28" TITLE : helm plugin support BODY : it would be nice to be able to support helm plugins for extended use. our particular use-case is to add something like https://github.com/skuid/helm-value-store to manage the values based on tag selectors. seeing how this is not a simple task i hope to discuss if it is even viable supporting a generic plugin framework or a fork supporting each plugin specifically would make more sense.
