 URL : "https://github.com/beagleboard/linux/issues/138" TITLE : ssh hangs on reboot BODY : i've booted the latest image https://debian.beagleboard.org/images/bone-debian-9.1-iot-armhf-2017-09-21-4gb.img.xz . when you ssh in and issue a reboot with sudo reboot or sudo shutdown -r now or even simply issue a shutdown with sudo shutdown now , the ssh session hangs and locks up the terminal. this solution https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/216950/after-sending-shutdown-command-ssh-session-doesnt-terminate answer-268726 appears to work, but it might be nice if the default image had this installed by default.
