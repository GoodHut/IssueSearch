 URL : "https://github.com/prometheus/graphite_exporter/issues/32" TITLE : allow substring wildcards BODY : this is, for some reason, an invalid mapping config: sensu.foo- . . name= sensu foo= $1 bar= $2 baz= $3 if i remove foo- it passes the mapping check. why is the mapping check so strict that it doesn't allow the wildcard anywhere but on its own, ie. between dots? thanks.
