 URL : "https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/2617" TITLE : improve architecture tests BODY : i just noticed that our architecture tests currently do not cover static imports and, therefore, are missing at least one dependency that we want to forbid. the class org.jabref.logic.pdf.pdfannotationimporter currently includes this statement import static org.jabref.gui.importer.actions.opendatabaseaction.logger . apart from being totally unnecessary there would be no problem in using an own logger for the class , this is also forbidden. a fix to this issue should: 1. remove the dependency in pdfannotationimporter and using an own logger. 2. enhance the architecturetests to detect static imports which could lead to discovering further errors that might not be as easy to fix
