 URL : "https://github.com/modgethanc/plaintxtmines/issues/34" TITLE : nerf golems pls BODY : if a golem can clear out an entire mine with a few strikes, it queues up a bunch of strikes once it finishes a mine, and then just plows through the next mine instantly. this gets to some pretty serious mine-clearing chains. this is probably because strikes at empty mines don't actually count as golem strikes, somewhat relevant to 11 which i didn't notice was so bad until i made a hella op golem and then got stuck in a mine clearing chain
