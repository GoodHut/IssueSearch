 URL : "https://github.com/sakurity/securelogin/issues/25" TITLE : a few security concerns BODY : deterministic keypair derivation : i get that the idea is to avoid having another file that you must keep secure, but it is well proven that passwords suck. you could have the same smooth integration with a truly random per-device private key. can even reuse code from pgp and/or ssh keys. writing down password : https://securelogin.pw/ says _make sure you write down your master password_ - y'know, that thing that you are never supposed to do. why would you advocate this? plaintext private key : in issue 16, it was stated _users are encouraged to use full disk encryption and a passcode on their devices. apps are not responsible for this._ - encouraging is not enough. we've been through this with filezilla, who had to give in after 9 years: https://trac.filezilla-project.org/ticket/2935 - encrypting the private key does help, as it prevents random malware from making use of the file while the filesystem is unlocked.
