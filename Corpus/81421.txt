BODY : in https://suhr.github.io/obsc/ , you have written: drop dup ^2 + ^2 - abs as a solution for solving the y^2 + x^2 - |y| equation. it seems from your factor example that the input stack effect is x y z . if this is true, and the infix operator pattern works as described previously in the article, then the aforementioned obsc must be wrong, as illustrated in the following table: | operation | stack | |:--:|:---| | | x y z | | drop | x y | | dup | x y y | | ^2 + ^2 | x y^2 y^2 | | - | x 0 | | abs | x 0 | if it's intended that the order of stacked inputs differs from the factor code, then it should be made clear in the article that this is the case. otherwise, it'll lead to confusion.
