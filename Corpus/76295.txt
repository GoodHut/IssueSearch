 URL : "https://github.com/php-pm/php-pm/issues/219" TITLE : is posix_kill necessary? BODY : in processmanager https://github.com/php-pm/php-pm/blob/master/processmanager.php l237 we're signaling slaves with sigterm first no problem here and then killing them instantly after. because of this for no or max only one slave shutdown function is able to execute which is non-standard behavior. also destructors are not able to execute properly since posix_kill doesn't wait for process to gracefully end. this is not expected in any way. can we discuss possibility to remove posix_kill usage or make it dependent on $graceful parameter?
