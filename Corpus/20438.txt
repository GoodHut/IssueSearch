 URL : "https://github.com/night/BetterTTV/issues/2272" TITLE : chat scroll spazzy BODY : observe: https://streamable.com/xzrzd this only happens while i have bttv installed. it seems new messages have something like a 50% chance to trigger the chat to scroll all the way to the top, which makes it impossible to try and read the chat, and basically makes the whole extension useless! since what is bttv without chat? . this happens the same on my other computer as well, so i know its not just me.
