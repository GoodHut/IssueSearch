 URL : "https://github.com/MediaMath/t1-python/issues/129" TITLE : only post changed fields BODY : implement support for only posting back the changed fields when saving an entity. this will reduce network overhead and will also give some advantages like reverting unintended field changes. can be done by instantiating a dict of reference fields in entity __init__ , and comparing on save . this will also simplify the _migration_asst functions in campaign and strategy written for the spend cap and pacing migrations, which do this in a limited scope.
