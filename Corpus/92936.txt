 URL : "https://github.com/GetStream/stream-laravel/issues/62" TITLE : activitytrait doesn't boot BODY : laravel 5.4.28, stream-laravel 2.2.8, stream-php 2.5.0. a while ago my activity feeds stopped working and they kind of just got forgotten about. i'm coming back to it, and i've found: - my eloquent models are being created just fine, it's just not getting pushed to getstream. - placed a log statement into activitytrait@bootactivitytrait to see if the trait is even being triggered. - the repository library i'm using, doesn't call model::create , it calls model::newinstance . i've tried directly calling mymodel::create to see if the trait gets triggered, but it doesn't. i've tried making a new app within get-stream, no success. if i manually push the activity within my model boot function, it works: public static function boot { static::created function $model { $manager = \app::make 'feed_manager' ; $manager->activitycreated $model ; } ; } this is an okay workaround for me personally, as i only have a handful of activity actions, but i really wouldn't want to do this if my models were any more complicated than a bridge between a user and an object. this also works when using model::newinstance , so i can only assume the issue lies within the trait not booting properly.
