BODY : in /src/data/scientific.hs https://github.com/basvandijk/scientific/blob/770e7db512aa0afd2b58b472d30599e9e685f58f/src/data/scientific.hs , we find the parser scientificp :: readp scientific . to use this parser in my own program, i ended up manually copying the parserâ€™s code out. it would have been nice if it had been directly available from data.scientific . what do you think about exposing this parser to the public?
