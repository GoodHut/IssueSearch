 URL : "https://github.com/clbr/radeontop/issues/51" TITLE : small support request BODY : hi, i'm working on adding support for gpu loads for a gnome shell extension https://github.com/paradoxxxzero/gnome-shell-system-monitor-applet/pull/386 . since i don't own a radeon gpu, i can't test the tool. i was wondering if you could provide me with a way of getting the information needed in a succinct cli way. i need: the gpu load, the vram used, and total vram. dummy example command: radeontop | grep load radeontop | grep vram thanks a lot for your time! fran
