 URL : "https://github.com/JosephusPaye/Keen-UI/issues/362" TITLE : demo-site uiconfirm issue BODY : on your demo site, when opening the uiconfirm dialogs, the button click animation for the cancel/ok buttons is stuck mid animation by default. i havent used this lib yet so i cant confirm its an issue in the library, but while looking at the lib i noticed this. great looking set of ui components though!
