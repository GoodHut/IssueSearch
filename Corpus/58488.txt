 URL : "https://github.com/pyaiot/pyaiot/issues/18" TITLE : slider element support BODY : i would like to have slider support in pyaiot. now there shouldn't be much difficulty in this, grab a slider bootstrap thing, program it almost the same way the led button is done, anyway, that's not the issue here : for my project i want to use it as a pwm setting, slider indicates and controls the duty cycle of the pwm output. now there are probably more applications that would require a slider and not only for pwm. so maybe naming it pwm is a bit too specific. do you have an opinion on what to name this element?
