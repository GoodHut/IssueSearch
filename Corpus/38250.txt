 URL : "https://github.com/cuckoosandbox/cuckoo/issues/1589" TITLE : options are not sent BODY : hello, i'm writing an auxiliary module guest side , and i want to switch it on/off or tweak behavior based on options sent, either via api or from web interface. so i looked at the existing modules, and found that: class dbgview auxiliary : run dbgview. def start self : if not self.options.get dbgview : return so i've created my own module and i'm just dumping the options dict for testing, but it appears that the custom options are not inside. this is all i get when i'm adding test: yes in the extra options fields of the submission page: modules.auxiliary.roguekiller info: { procmemdump : yes , route : none , apk_entry : : } any chance that is a bug? or do i need to validate options elsewhere in the code?
