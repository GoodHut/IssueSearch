 URL : "https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/issues/111" TITLE : openssl is still required BODY : commit 6e2602a5 removes openssl dependencies, claiming that it isn't required anymore. i think it is in fact still required: > git grep '^ include <openssl' snis_hash.c: include <openssl/md5.h> snis_hash.c: include <openssl/sha.h> and building a debian package at least when using sbuild or pbuilder, where openssl incidentally being installed in the host system doesn't save the build like when using debuild or dpkg-buildpackage fails when compiling the snis_hash.c file. i think the solution to this would be to re-add the openssl dependencies in debian/control and the relevant parts in makefile , but it the medium to long term either the used parts md5 and sha should be replaced or another solution to the licensing issues with openssl be found what exactly is the problem here? and how do other gpl projects solve that?
