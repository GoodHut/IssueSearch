 URL : "https://github.com/BuildCraft/BuildCraft/issues/3667" TITLE : 7.99.4 diamond pipes BODY : i've noticed that string, arrows, and spider eye will not always be properly sorted. i have a diamond sorter pipe set up with blue and green sorted outputs, and yellow flow through. the items will randomly go in any of the 3 directions even when set as blue. does not cause crash i think, hasn't happened anyways
