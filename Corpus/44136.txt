 URL : "https://github.com/pjrule/federal-election-data/issues/2" TITLE : election finance data BODY : apparently, all of the fec's data on campaign finances and related stuff is here http://classic.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/ftpdet.shtml in a very easy and consistent text format. i think some simple parsing of the data will turn them into a nice csv file that will be consistent with the format in which the voting data is in.
