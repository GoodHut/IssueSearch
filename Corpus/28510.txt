 URL : "https://github.com/PhantomAppDevelopment/firebase-as3/issues/10" TITLE : google policy issue BODY : can you authenticate google account? i had tried your samples, it was okay long time ago when you released first commit. but unfortunately right now i can't do that again. it seems google has new policy for web view. when i tried to authenticate my firebase using google got this message > 403 error this user-agent is not permitted to make oauth authorisation request to google as it is classified as an embedded user-agent also known as a web-view . per our policy, only browsers are permitted to make authorisation requests to google. we offer several libraries and samples for native apps to perform authorisation request in browser.
