 URL : "https://github.com/thkruz/keeptrack.space-Issues/issues/14" TITLE : full ssn/foreign view BODY : option to view what the whole ssn or all russian/prc tracking stations can view. this could be then leveraged to see what objects are out of view dark space and for how long. modifying satcruncher to do a full network check similar to how the ssn lookangles function works would enable this. it would require passing a binary variable to the web worker when the settings menu is modified.
