 URL : "https://github.com/i042416/KnowlegeRepository/issues/124" TITLE : gross time and net time BODY : created by jerry wang, last modified on oct 06, 2014 以一个简单的例子说明： abap report ztest22. start-of-selection. perform main. call function 'ztime_spent' exporting iv_time = 2. call function 'ztime_spent' exporting iv_time = 1 iv_nested = abap_true. write:/ 'finish'. form main. wait up to 1 seconds. endform. ztime_spent的实现: abap check iv_time > 0. wait up to iv_time seconds. if iv_nested = abap_true. call function 'ztime_spent2' exporting iv_time = iv_time. endif. ztime_spent2的实现: abap check iv_time > 0. wait up to iv_time seconds. 总的gross time: 1 subroutine main + 2 ztime_spent call with iv_nested = abap_false + 1 time spent on ztime_spent itself + 1 time spent on ztime_spent2, since iv_nested = abap_true 第一次ztime_spent调用，其gross time = net time = 2 seconds 第二次ztime_spent调用, 其net time = 1 second wait up to 1 second , 其gross time 的另一个1 second是花费在另一个function module call ztime_spent2 上的，因此不能计算在其net time内。
