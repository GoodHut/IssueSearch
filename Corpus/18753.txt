 URL : "https://github.com/py-pa/django-minio-storage/issues/48" TITLE : update pypi index BODY : hey there, i have been using your package and i noticed that the version installed https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-minio-storage using pip install django-minio-storage is not up to date with the github repository. this lead to confusion since i didn't recheck the version installed after the command and confused me. :sweat_smile: i resorted at the end to installing it using the command pipenv install git+https://github.com/py-pa/django-minio-storage.git egg=django-minio-storage wich was suggested to me after i asked this so question https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47018200/importerror-raised-trying-to-import-a-function/47036834?noredirect=1 comment81020166_47036834 . doing so led to some problems concerning my packages and the requirements.txt file. i'd like also to note that i noticed several good changes between the version in pypi and your repository, so i think synchronizing them will help other people use your package more efficiently. thank you in advance
