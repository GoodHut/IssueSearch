BODY : so, i believe it's not a bug, it's my dumbness, but i cloned it and there's no src/main/java folder. cloned it that way - https://gyazo.com/302dbe7512b72983e06214ec60ad57dc and got that - https://gyazo.com/7b82cea1a2b9f9aa9bd235bea33b64a0 isn't there supposed to be a src/main/java source folder, not a folder? how do i fix it? also i added to my other plugin's pom.xml this: <dependency> <groupid>litebans</groupid> <artifactid>api</artifactid> <version>0.2</version> <scope>provided</scope> </dependency> and it says that it's missing artifact litebans:api:jar:0.2 probably it's my dumbness.
