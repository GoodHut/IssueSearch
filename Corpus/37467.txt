 URL : "https://github.com/SickGear/SickGear/issues/962" TITLE : mapped network drive BODY : this is strange, i don't know if it has anything to do with sickgear. i installed sickgear on windows 10 on 6/21/16 it is now updated to branch: master / commit: 9c3a158a5df3aea9f438e3038074282e2fbe5f44. it can see and use my mapped network drive in post processing. i installed a new fresh instance alongside same hash different port. it cannot see the mapped network drive, but works fine otherwise. i copied the entire contents of the old sickgear folder into the folder of the new install. it is still not working. i did edit the port. what could be the difference?
