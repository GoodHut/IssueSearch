 URL : "https://github.com/m2049r/xmrwallet/issues/168" TITLE : mobile network slowness BODY : i'm running 1.2.11 , and it seems that the wallet takes a really long time to connect to a remote node when using a mobile data network. took about 4 minutes to get connected . i'm on an lte network. it is obviously really fast when using my wifi. i'm wondering if its something on the wallet end. i remember at one point the monero gui had some problems with the dns resolving when the gui would start the daemon - is there any possibility that some aspect of the monero-wallet-cli which i think this uses as its backend , has some weird dns thingy going on. on the other hand, i wonder if there's anything that can be done on the remote node end. like, how could the servers be modified to make it faster?
