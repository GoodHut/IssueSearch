 URL : "https://github.com/p4lang/p4-spec/issues/307" TITLE : psa counter size s BODY : for counters that have a number of counters that is an exact power of 2, e.g. 1024, a single type s that is bit<10> is just right for the 'index' parameter to 'count', but it is 1 bit too small for the 'n_counters' parameter of the constructor. might be good to have a separate type for the 'n_counters' paremeter?
