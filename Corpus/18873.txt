 URL : "https://github.com/AnTi-ArT/Auto-Node-Types/issues/3" TITLE : use of svg path s BODY : idea: instead of just changing the sodipodi:nodetypes the plugin could also correct the path data to use s, s or t, t . note: it's not really supported by inkscape. manually entered s-data is instantly turned into c/c... ...and it's not even changing to s or z in the :nodetypes string! ðŸ˜ž idea postponed for now. example path d: m 0,0 c 1,0 10,5 10,10 s 20,15 20,20 ==> m 0,0 c 1,0 10,5 10,10 c 10,15 20,15 20,20
