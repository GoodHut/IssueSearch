 URL : "https://github.com/functionalcave/code-cool/issues/2" TITLE : allow choosing languages BODY : the app is using _codemirror_ as code editor and _highlight.js_ to highlight syntax in a screenshot. both libraries support a large list of languages. we want to allow selecting a language that is supported in both libraries. - codemirror language modes https://codemirror.net/mode/ - highlight.js languages https://highlightjs.org/download/ requirements - create ui control that displays current language and lists all available languages - when a language selected, switch both editor and highlighter in appropriate language mode - the editor stores last input in localstorage , implement language detection to automatically switch language mode on load _note:_ highlight.js does language detection, one possible way to do this in the app is to paste in the code, initialize highlighting and parse class name which corresponds to detected language name.
