BODY : according to the documentation, the flag ird in the trac block has the following effect: ird integer switch for the type of amplitude variation. in case napx = 1 the amplitude nstart is used. • ird = 0 : amplitudes are varied between the amplitudes amp 1 and amp0 with equal increments: delta = amp0 − amp 1 / napx − 1 • ird = 1 : amplitude variation to find an estimate for the short term dynamic aperture. the amplitude is increased or decremented corresponding to stable motion or particle loss respectively. the change of amplitude is reduced each iteration i ≤ napx − 1 to: delta = amp0 − amp 1 /2^i however when reading the code, the variable is read and then ignored... i think the documentation is wrong here?
