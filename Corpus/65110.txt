 URL : "https://github.com/christhekeele/mnemonix/issues/29" TITLE : implement match feature BODY : this would be a theoretical matchspec supporting feature, with a match/select api. the default implementation could run through enumerable to see if full iteration were possible, and if so bank on http://erlang.org/doc/man/ets.html match_spec_run-2 to run the match. this would mean only select was supported, since there's no equivalent for simple match notation. unless we expanded the match into a matchspec. it could be optimized for ets, dets, and mensia. it could be called select, match, or qlc depending on the impl.
