BODY : i'm using vue-text-mask to create a currency input.. displayed as $3,444,324 or 3 444 324 $ in french. i have these linked to a vuex store so i can call get the value of the inputs for use in calculations, but for use in the app, i really want a number 3444324. i could filter the strings back into numbers before using them in calculations, but that seems potentially risky.. is there any way to access the originally entered number?
