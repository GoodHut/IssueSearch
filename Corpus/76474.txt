 URL : "https://github.com/vyuldashev/laravel-queue-rabbitmq/issues/133" TITLE : l4.2: jobs does not fail BODY : throwing an exception inside the job should normally force the job to fail. this doesn't seem to be the case thought. take a look: public function fire $job, $data { $model = $data 'model' ; $id = $data 'id' ; $entity = $model::find $id ; $accountmail = isset $entity->email ? $entity->email : $entity->head_email; $activationcode = $entity->user->getactivationcode ; $activationlink = url user/activate/{$entity->user->id}/{$activationcode} ; try { mail::send 'emails.auth.activate', array 'username' => $entity->user->username, 'link' => $activationlink , function $message use $entity, $accountmail { $message->to $accountmail ->subject lang::get 'email.activate_subject' ; } ; log::info 'account activation email sent.', array 'recipient' => $accountmail ; $job->delete ; } catch \exception $e { log::error 'account activation email failed to be sent.' ; } } using faulty credentials for the smtp triggers the catch block and the error log entry is written normally. however, the job has not been added to failed jobs. my worker is running with 1 retry which never happens as the failed event doesn't seem to get triggered at all. php artisan queue:work -vvv --daemon --tries=1 could anyone else confirm this?
