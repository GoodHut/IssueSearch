 URL : "https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/ng-read-create/issues/1" TITLE : formatting is jacked BODY : the formatting is all sorts of messed up for read-create and update-destroy. i worked on ud, can someone work on cr? things are supposed to be bold but aren't. things are supposed to be italicized but aren't... maybe too many detail/summary tags? they mess up the formatting of md inside the tags. also add a gif somewhere.
