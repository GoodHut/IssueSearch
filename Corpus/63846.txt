 URL : "https://github.com/thp/psmoveapi/issues/336" TITLE : explicitly use opencv 2 BODY : we should use a version from opencv's 2.x branch. the c api was deprecated in opencv 3.x, and stuff breaks see 335, 251 . plus, there really is no need to use opencv 3. we use non of its features. the 2.x branch is still maintained by opencv folks. if there are mentions of opencv 3 in the documentation, they should be replaced. if some of the build scripts either use opencv 3 or do not specifically use 2.x, they should be fixed, too.
