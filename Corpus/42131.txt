 URL : "https://github.com/mayukh18/BlindChat/issues/2" TITLE : age verification gate BODY : when a new user is encountered user doesn't exist in users db ask for the age. simple what's your age? give two options 18 or over and under 18 . first option will lead directly to the welcome message. the second option will send a message suggesting parental guidance first then go to the welcome message block. though the app in under facebook , their policies probably cover this but still it is better to have this check.
