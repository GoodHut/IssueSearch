 URL : "https://github.com/borela/naomi/issues/25" TITLE : multiline arrow functions BODY : currently, the following would not be highlight as an arrow function: js let a = param1, param2 => { // body } this limitation is from sublime itself as you can see here https://forum.sublimetext.com/t/match-multiple-lines-in-sublime-syntax/24645 and here https://github.com/sublimetextissues/core/issues/1412 . the regex pattern in the syntax would work if multiline support is added to sublime syntax.
