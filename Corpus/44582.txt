 URL : "https://github.com/centrual/cordova-template-framework7-vue-webpack/issues/47" TITLE : feature request: vuex BODY : any interest in adding vuex as well? i've used your project here twice and i like it. i look forward to using it more. i find that adding vuex is almost always my next step and even when it's not, it's only because i'm rolling my own for very small testing projects. in those cases, i would be just as happy to have vuex already installed. this is just a suggestion. you might have other plans or use cases to meet and if so, no worries at all. i hate having to post this as an issue. is there a better way to have this conversation? i'm relatively new to github still. thank you for your efforts on this project already. greatly appreciated.
