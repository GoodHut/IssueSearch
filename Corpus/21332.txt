 URL : "https://github.com/fable-compiler/Fable/issues/826" TITLE : extend bcl support BODY : the current replacements module is good to have more control over the more used classes from the bcl/fsharp.core and inline code when possible to improve performance. however, this model probably won't escalate very well if we want to extend bcl support. there are other projects that try to port the bcl to js so we could ~~steal~~take inspiration from them and bridge the code so it can be used by fable. something similar as what was done with the int64 type. we should still keep the module approach so users only need to bundle what they actually use in their apps. any ideas? cc @ncave @7sharp9
