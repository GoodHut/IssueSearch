 URL : "https://github.com/vphantom/pyritephp/issues/11" TITLE : clean up event vs oo api BODY : this will break pyritephp-example and pyriteview, so it is pushed back to the next major release. right now our api is a majority of events and a minority of oo. with events, we solved problems of caller not knowing the handler, of prioritizing multiple handlers for a single trigger and of cascading handlers as content filters. because of these, i guess event-driven wins over oo. we need to clean up accordingly and create more robust structure and documentation for those. i'd hope we can do better than class::bootstrap .
