 URL : "https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/2589" TITLE : 1.6 tracking issue BODY : i'm going to have more time in the coming weeks to do a proper release, so starting a issue to figure out what needs to be done: - write the changelog - run the jsx ternary big change through facebook codebase and any edge cases it finds - investigate and fix jsx/fbt issue that prevented to release 1.5 to fb www repo. the fix is likely going to be inside of the fbt transform so not open source. correctness issues we should fix: - implement a tokenizer that extracts css comments and use prettier comment attachment instead of the current node-based comment that drops a lot of them 2127 - fix css issue with @import without semi-colon 2584 - fix import comment in flow parser 2555
