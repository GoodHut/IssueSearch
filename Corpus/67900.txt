 URL : "https://github.com/trthatcher/MLKernels.jl/issues/48" TITLE : random fourier features BODY : random fourier features is a technique for approximating inner products in the rkhs using a randomized feature map. it would be great to have this in mlkernels. here's a paper introducing them: random features for large-scale kernel machines http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~brecht/papers/07.rah.rec.nips.pdf a blog post demonstrating their use: random fourier features for kernel density estimation https://mlstat.wordpress.com/2010/10/04/random-fourier-features-for-kernel-density-estimation/ the kernel being approximated needs to have some specific properties. mainly it needs to be stationary shift-invariant and scaled properly. i need to look into this a bit more, but it seems like it might not be too difficult to implement. the main part being a function spectraldensity , which takes a kernel as an argument and returns a distribution to sample from.
