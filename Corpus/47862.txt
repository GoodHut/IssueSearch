 URL : "https://github.com/robot9706/FSSE/issues/65" TITLE : quest keeps repeating BODY : there's an open issue where a quest honeymoon horror continuously repeats. i'm guessing it's a matter of the quest not flagging as completed. https://beta-community.bethesda.net/topic/10667/repeated-quest-all-over-again https://www.reddit.com/r/foshelter/comments/5gupi3/honeymoon_horror_quest/ can a fix be added to the save editor? or would you just prefer to wait and see if bethesda patches it?
