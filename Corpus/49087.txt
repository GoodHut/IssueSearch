 URL : "https://github.com/gregnb/filemanager-webpack-plugin/issues/2" TITLE : support for wildcards BODY : hello, it would be great to work with glob https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob to support wildcards. unfortunately cpr https://www.npmjs.com/package/cpr does not support this, so i suggest to use another library such as cpx https://www.npmjs.com/package/cpx maybe? thank you for the plugin anyway.
