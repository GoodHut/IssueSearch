 URL : "https://github.com/hazuki0x0/YuzuBrowser/issues/3" TITLE : a few things BODY : first i want to say that i really enjoy this browser. the customization options are amazing. i just have a few suggestions: 1. i would love to be able to choose what i take a screenshot off for example maybe just a little bit of the web page. 2. a way to make text urls clickable. 3. it would be nice to be able to pop out a video i'm watching, and be able to check another tab and multitask. hope you understand what i mean. keep up the work with this amazing browser
