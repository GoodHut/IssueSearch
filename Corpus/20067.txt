 URL : "https://github.com/Cleverlance/Pyramid/issues/11" TITLE : better example app BODY : it will be nice to have some simple app like _todo list_ or _twitter app_ as the example. currently the example contains only some tests and therefore it is not clear how to apply this architecture in the real life development. i would like to help with this. is it now feasible? or is the development of core parts still in progress? feel free to contact me directly.
