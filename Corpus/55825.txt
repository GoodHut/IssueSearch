 URL : "https://github.com/OpenDataServices/cove/issues/908" TITLE : load cove as a library BODY : follow-up to 207, i'd like to be able to use cove as a library. the reason is that for bulk validation of large datasets, i don't want to download all packages and then run each one through the command-line tool. i suppose i could write a shell script that downloads one package at a time maintaining state , and runs the command-line tool, but there is also a lot of overhead to setting up django each time, and i want this process to be fast. right now, it seems i need to put my script in the same working directory as cove in order to run, e.g.: os.environ.setdefault django_settings_module , cove_ocds.settings from cove_ocds.lib.api import apiexception, ocds_json_output
