 URL : "https://github.com/eslcc/projects/issues/7" TITLE : eslcc members website BODY : with github and slack oauth, members could log in to our website, where they would have their members profiles. these would let them share some info about themselves, also perhaps integrate with writing blog posts. it would add a leveling system with xp and achievements, to show off what they are doing now and what they have achieved already. xp and achievements would be given by leaders of the club. i'm imagining something like khan academy.
