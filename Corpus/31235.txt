 URL : "https://github.com/RobWin/jgitflow-gradle-plugin/issues/15" TITLE : scm prefix / suffix BODY : jgitflow allows for configuration of a prefix or suffix in a commit message. my team is adding some commit hooks that enforce an issue at the beginning of our commit messages as a way to easily track the commit back to an issue. however, the commit hooks will fail with jgitflow's standard commit messages. would you be ok if i submitted a pr to allow for scmcommitprefix and scmcommitsuffix properties to be passed to jgitflow commands at run time?
