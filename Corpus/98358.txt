 URL : "https://github.com/marmelab/admin-on-rest/issues/582" TITLE : integrate login with redux BODY : use case i stumbled upon this problem when trying to solve what i thought is a pretty common use case: extracting information from the auth_login response and putting it into the store. in my case, i am retrieving a jwt and have to extract the current user id and put it into the store in order to be able to display data of the current user inside my custom components display username in app bar, change locale based on user settings etc . current implementation currently when using the admin component, there is no way to access the store from the authclient . no actions are dispatched on successful login, so it is impossible to handle this with a custom reducer or saga. this forces people to go down the custom app route for what seems to me a pretty basic use case. also, the official docs recommend setting and reading auth tokens from localstorage which is a side effect and should probably be avoided in order to stick with the redux wayâ„¢ of doing things. possible solutions easy way: dispatch auth_login_success action or any auth actions for that matter from login component and recommend handling those with a custom saga to set the token or perform other actions in the docs. hard way: remove fetch logic and by extension authclient from login completely and handle things with a login/auth saga and reducer. thoughts on this?
