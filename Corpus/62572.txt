 URL : "https://github.com/haxetink/tink_sql/issues/16" TITLE : consider sql-ish syntax BODY : for more sql-like syntax for those who prefer it : - db.select _ .from user .where id == 42 - db.insert_into user, name, age .values jack , 23 , joe , 35 - db.update user .set age = age + 1 .where birthday == date.now in particular the select syntax seems a little backward to me saying what you want before saying where you want it from and i'm generally not sure it's worth the trouble, but it's worth investigating.
