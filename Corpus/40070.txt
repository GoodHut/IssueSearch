 URL : "https://github.com/gbif/portal16/issues/369" TITLE : taxonomy on datasets BODY : on checklists there is a taxonomy browser on the current site. this hasn't been carried and seems a shame. we have something very close to it in form of the new species pages that have a taxonomy browser, but there is no linkage between the two. adding root and a link from dataset could possibly be a solution
