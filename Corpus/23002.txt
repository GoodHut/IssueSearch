 URL : "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-dotnet/issues/67" TITLE : new project system BODY : with the release of visual studio 2017, project.json projects will be abandoned in favor of the new csproj. i know that the lambda tools are marked as preview for this very reason. my question is, transitioning to the project system will introduce any change on how we consume the package?
