 URL : "https://github.com/clara-mctc/lmn/issues/81" TITLE : get initial data for app BODY : how will this application get initial data? at the moment, shows, venues, and artists must be added through the administrator console. should users be able to add venues, artists, shows? if so, how will you moderate this? where else will your application get data from? maybe you could focus on the twin cities and find a list of venues; and figure out some programatic method of getting data for shows, perhaps write a web scraper for first-avenue.com and other popular venues? should users be able to create shows from artists and venues already in the database?
