 URL : "https://github.com/plantbreeding/API/issues/144" TITLE : ids in calls call response BODY : i remember having raised this question in seattle last summer. we need consistency in the way we format the calls call's response where ids are involved. because clients will probably want to be able to check in a simple way if a given server implements the calls it requires. what i remember is that we ended up deciding that no matter which call / entity type an id refers to, it must be formatted as the following static string: {id} i still see implementations in brapi-resources.json that do not comply with this should it be clearly stated somewhere in the docs? . same situation with peter's brapi-java-testserver you can't be blamed, you were not there at that time . anyway, unless we have a good reason for changing our mind peter, you might have one? , can we please all take this into account?
