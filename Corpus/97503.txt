 URL : "https://github.com/dadi/publish/issues/71" TITLE : handle failure of auth api BODY : steps to reproduce 1. take down the api used to validate sessions. 1. go to /sign-in and type any email+password 1. the app fails silently details api wrapper is returning an error object which can be seen by adding a catch here https://github.com/dadi/publish/blob/master/dadi/lib/controllers/session.js l21 . but the app doesn't seem to pick up this error, perhaps because of the way that controller is being called as a middleware here https://github.com/dadi/publish/blob/master/dadi/lib/router/routes/session.js l28 . expected behaviour the failure should bubble all the way up to the view, so that i'm able to add a catch here https://github.com/dadi/publish/blob/master/dadi/frontend/views/signin/signin.jsx l105 and deal with the error by displaying a message. i have some ideas to handle this last bit, which will involve adding some constants to represent error states and display messages accordingly, but if you could help me get to the point where i can capture the failure on the view that'd be great.
