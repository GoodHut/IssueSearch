 URL : "https://github.com/Requarks/wiki/issues/18" TITLE : new page? linking? search? BODY : not really sure where this falls as an issue. i created a new page showing new-page.md in my repo directory. yet when i search for the page, nothing comes up. on my sidebar under contents it does not show, but if i navigate to it /new-page it comes up fine, and now in the sidebar it still has start which previous page had and this page, but not my other page? so guess i need a guide on how your wiki uses contents and navigation because it's not similar to other comercial wikis.
