 URL : "https://github.com/llambda/connect-session-knex/issues/35" TITLE : use given schema BODY : apparently, this module only allows one to pass a custom table name, but not a schema name. as a result, it is impossible to use a schema other than the default search path indicates. an example usage of schema specification would look like this: js new knexstore { knex: myknexinstance, tablename: 'sessions', schemaname: 'myapp' } any thoughts?
