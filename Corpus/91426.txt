 URL : "https://github.com/thopiekar/CuraSolidWorksPlugin/issues/33" TITLE : todo: shrinking the macro BODY : definitely the macro needs a major shrinkage. todo: - keep the bits of code, which are checking for the cura installation - siemensnx plugin has some functions to do that - check and see whether they are better or not - getting out the cherries - bundling also everything into a function to improve readability - removing the code, which is doing a conversion and a exporting into an stl. - passing directly the so called active document to cura directly. - the plugin itself determines the filepath. we can get inspiration from here.
