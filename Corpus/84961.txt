 URL : "https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/issues/1268" TITLE : dynamic number of screens BODY : hey, i am working on a project that has persistent bottom tabs think instagram style navigation . for example, the layout may look like this: tabnavigator: - homefeed - searchscreen - addpost - notifications - profile i want to make the newsfeed like any other; on the newfeed, you can tap on a person's name say manan and it takes you manan's profile still being on home tab . now, you're on manan's profile and say you click on a person appearing in manan's posts. you go to that person's profile etc. it's a dynamic stack basically where you keep pushing screens. in the end, pressing back will take me back to my newfeed following the same route back... how do i go about implementing? is there support for this kind of navigation?
