 URL : "https://github.com/pypa/manylinux/issues/128" TITLE : drop 32-bit support? BODY : @ionelmc was asking in pypa whether anyone actually uses 32-bit linux, so i ran some queries https://langui.sh/2016/12/09/data-driven-decisions/ , and it looks like currently the answer is: numpy: 99.5% of manylinux downloads are 64-bit lxml: 99.8% of manylinux downloads are 64-bit so no, almost no-one uses 32-bit linux. i figured i'd open an issue to write down this observation, and raise the question of whether or when we should stop bothering to make 32-bit manylinux images. ----- noting for future reference: select count as downloads, regexp_extract file.filename, r'. - manylinux ^- + ' as manylinux from table_date_range the-psf:pypi.downloads , timestamp 20171120 , current_timestamp where file.project = 'lxml' group by manylinux order by downloads desc limit 1000
