 URL : "https://github.com/scaleway/image-ubuntu/issues/93" TITLE : 16.04 build fails BODY : make install fails for me at docker build step 7/18, https://github.com/scaleway/image-ubuntu/blob/master/16.04/dockerfile l42 i'm currently playing on a scaleway c1 xenial server. w/out the -qq l42 prints: the following packages have unmet dependencies: udev : depends: libudev1 = 229-4ubuntu10 but 229-4ubuntu16 is to be installed unattended-upgrades : depends: apt-utils but it is not going to be installed e: unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages. i see this commit https://github.com/scaleway/image-ubuntu/commit/c3b73366f325978328ee566730810fec02c71107 dropped the explicit libudev1=229-4ubuntu10 from the apt-get pkg list, but it's needed for apt-get to actually do the downgrade iff armv7l . i'm happy to fix this. i'd just do $ test ${arch} = armv7l && echo libudev1=229-4ubuntu10 on another line below install . similar problem with unattended-upgrades . adding apt-utils to apt-get install list gives: the following packages have unmet dependencies: apt-utils : depends: apt = 1.2.15ubuntu0.2 but 1.2.20 is to be installed
