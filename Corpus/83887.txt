 URL : "https://github.com/webtorrent/webtorrent-desktop/issues/1194" TITLE : compatibility with win xp BODY : i downloaded the latest version of installer from the site, and then the zip archive from here. webtorrentsetup-v0.18.0-ia32.exe and webtorrent-v0.18.0-win-ia32.zip . but i get not a valid win32 application when i try to run it. i'm running win xp. does this mean there is no comaptibility with this os?
