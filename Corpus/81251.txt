 URL : "https://github.com/hawk/lux/issues/20" TITLE : what is a match_timeout? BODY : in version 1.15.1, there is a failure that may occur that is called match_timeout . an example of this can be seen in test/examples.delux https://github.com/hawk/lux/blob/master/test/examples.delux current version https://github.com/hawk/lux/blob/d908fade76ccfa4fb26cf53711e9e3937e4604bf/test/examples.delux . however, there is no documentation on what this timeout means or how it is used. see doc/lux.md https://github.com/hawk/lux/blob/master/doc/lux.md current version https://github.com/hawk/lux/blob/f8d47efeadba20e81af0a68dc0c27f39b6e93bd9/doc/lux.md . trying to use it like the other timeouts, e.g. lux --match_timeout infinity testcase.lux gives the error: lux.escript: --match_timeout is an illegal argument. by contrast, lux --case_timeout infinity testcase.lux runs just fine. what is a match_timeout and can you please add some documentation for it? thanks.
