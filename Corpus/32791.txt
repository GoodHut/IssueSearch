 URL : "https://github.com/Elive/ecomorph/issues/14" TITLE : wobbly effect fixes BODY : the maximize option gives some problems so its disabled by default , seems like the ctrl + alt + f is not correctly catched signal when it maximizes, sometimes you cannot un-maximize the window using the same combo, you can only resize it, and so the known state in ecomp for this window is wrong and you can see that because the wobbly is different, more distorted also, there's the ctrl + alt + r effect that is not catched at all, i remember that in the past it triggered the wobbly effect too
