 URL : "https://github.com/textmate/make.tmbundle/issues/12" TITLE : supporting mk files BODY : i tried using this tm bundle within phpstorm, i've successfully used others in the past , however it doesn't seem to work for .mk files https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/include.html . from my limited knowledge of tmbundles, this is because the file extension is missing here https://github.com/textmate/make.tmbundle/blob/master/syntaxes/makefile.plist l6 . that said, i tried changing the file locally and it still wouldn't work... i'm sure i'm missing something - i don't know much about how tmbundles work..
