 URL : "https://github.com/ganeti/ganeti/issues/218" TITLE : improve hspace output BODY : originally reported of google code with id 162. currently hspace sends output in a bash variable form which is great for machines to read but a bit of a pain for humans. it'd be great if by default hspace gave output in a more human readable form and gave the option of using the current bash variables. originally added on 2011-05-24 16:56:21 +0000 utc.
