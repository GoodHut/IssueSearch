 URL : "https://github.com/binfalse/YOURLS-FirefoxExtension/issues/11" TITLE : explanation of permissions BODY : great plugin, but it would be nice, if you could explain the permissions required by the add-on. when the extension tried to update itself, i got the following message: <img width= 326 alt= screen shot 2017-11-25 at 00 46 22 src= https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/223439/33227818-248766f4-d17a-11e7-8646-13a7b70c2ccf.png > this means that permission was not required with 2.0.0, so why does it need this permission now. and what does it mean anyway? the add-on can read all data i access via the web? hmmm.
