 URL : "https://github.com/pedroSG94/rtmp-rtsp-stream-client-java/issues/63" TITLE : stream display issue BODY : example using facebook it seems package not sent to facebook continiously. except if i use screen.. if i dont use screen it sends only audio packets.. when it sends video packages too.. maybe this is the issue that causes video to buffer on facebook even on youtube too. i use recommended settings for facebook too. and i use prepareaudio-video with custom settings. also is it right to send audio packets when i have it disabled? also need some declerations on hardware rotation , dpi. whether should i use that.? and what are some proper values for these?
