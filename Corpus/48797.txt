 URL : "https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/1533" TITLE : solr fallbacks issues BODY : what happened just before the problem occurred i set firewall from staging to solr indexer to drop as if solr was accepting connections but not responding . this caused timeouts and gateway errors 500 in the app. then i set the firewall to reject as if the port was closed . this seems to work better, relevant urls staging can simulate closed port by stopping the solr container docker-compose stop solr and restored with docker-compose start solr
