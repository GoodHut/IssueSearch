 URL : "https://github.com/Kurento/bugtracker/issues/195" TITLE : docker images healthcheck BODY : hi. you dockerfiles can specify healthchecks https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/ healthcheck . maybe it would be good to add something like: shell $ curl -w '%{http_code}' -n -h connection: upgrade -h upgrade: websocket -h host: 127.0.0.1:8888 -h origin: 127.0.0.1 http://127.0.0.1:8888/kurento == 500 && exit 0 || exit 1 ? so that if something happens with kurento server, it can be automatically restarted?
