 URL : "https://github.com/Insidious611/DancingMadFF6/issues/26" TITLE : no ending credits! BODY : i don't know if this is just in the patch from a few hours ago, or if this has been in there for a while, because i never took beating kefka to test dancing mad into the credits. once you beat kefka, the ending stuff starts to play, magic starts leaving the world and all that, then it gets to the bit where it shows a book with it's pages turning around where track 83 starts playing , and the book bit fades out and.... it just stays on a black screen with the msu-1 music playing.
