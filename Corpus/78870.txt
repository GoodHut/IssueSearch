 URL : "https://github.com/FreeUKGen/MyopicVicar/issues/1113" TITLE : remove stats from footer BODY : currently we display the stats for yesterday in the footer. this requires a lookup of the information every time a page is displayed.
we have tried loading the information into the session cookie but that has to be checked and reloaded if absent.
the statistics for yesterday are already displayed in the transcriptions page.
it is proposed that we eliminate the stats in the footer. we could add a statement that the stats are available in the transcriptions page
