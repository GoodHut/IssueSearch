 URL : "https://github.com/daniestevez/gr-kiss/issues/2" TITLE : kiss to pdu block problem BODY : it seems like something is wrong with the kiss to pdu block, it seems to be unconnected in all the examples. it looks like the flow graph is set up expecting it to have a pdu input that comes from the tcp server block, but the input type is packed? bytes and does not connect. is there an error in the block, or uncommitted/pushed code that makes it work?
