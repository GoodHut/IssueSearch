 URL : "https://github.com/figueiredorui/1-click-child-links/issues/11" TITLE : prefix tasks with a tag BODY : creating a sytematic set of tasks is really nice. by the way, as tasks are assigned to users, when 'development' tasks of several user stories are assigned to someone, he can't see directly to which user story each task belongs. he has to open detail and then jump to the parent. a nice improvement would be to add a kind of tag to prefix the task's titles.
