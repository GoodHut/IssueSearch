 URL : "https://github.com/mtazzari/galario/issues/93" TITLE : add galario to conda BODY : to simplify the installation for users, we can add galario to conda-forge now that we have v1.0 this place has all the links to get started https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes basically we have to create a .yml file that wraps up how we want galario to be built, then there are binary packages for mac os and linux. i think we can have a fairly easy time since all our our dependencies are on conda forge except maybe fftw but there is pyfftw on conda forge which we can depend on and that has to ship or build fftw
