 URL : "https://github.com/arafato/azurite/issues/25" TITLE : help getting started BODY : could you add some documentation or pointers to existing documentation that explains how to connect to the local server? i'm looking at this for example: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-python-how-to-use-blob-storage, and i can't find a way to tell the client to connect to anything else but the real azure services.
