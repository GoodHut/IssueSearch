 URL : "https://github.com/ecmadao/react-times/issues/25" TITLE : add more props for picker BODY : this is nice picker, but i hope you can consider to fix somethings: 1. add props open=true/false to show picker on render without click button 2. remove time on picker_pointer_drag when dragging, it's keeps old value on dragging seem make no sense 3. twelvehoursmode - picker not close after select time, should has a ok button to close user'll dont know click around to close - minute_pointer_drag should only drag to minute now it can be drag to point_wrapper
