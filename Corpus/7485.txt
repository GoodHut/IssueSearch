 URL : "https://github.com/TalkBank/shiny-vagrant/issues/4" TITLE : gandalf is down BODY : just wondering if there is a reason that the shiny server on gandalf is down. apache seems to be working, so it seems to be up. i'm wondering if one of my recent changes is the problem. even if shiny isn't working, the index.html page should still work, but it is not showing up. any thoughts?
