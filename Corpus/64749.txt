 URL : "https://github.com/Mij-Strebor/Current-OA-Website/issues/10" TITLE : home page announcements BODY : the current three column structure for announcements will not work for smaller devices. the two sidebars collapse and the content overflows the containers. the main body should be all that appears on a smaller screen. displaying as a single column means that the menu in the left aside will have to go; that topic is dealt with in issue 9.
