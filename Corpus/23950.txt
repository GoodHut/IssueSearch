 URL : "https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/6396" TITLE : rfc: april release BODY : it's been awhile since a release; we should do 6.2.0. i imagine it's a minor release because the new feature is that pouchdb-find is being taken out of beta. this isn't to say that pouchdb-find is perfect yet, but it is fairly well fleshed-out, and any bugs can be fixed quickly without affecting user data since all of the bugs i'm aware of are in the runtime query engine and not in the indexer.
