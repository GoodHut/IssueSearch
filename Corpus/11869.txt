 URL : "https://github.com/kripken/emscripten-fastcomp/issues/193" TITLE : llvm 5.0 upgrade BODY : hello! with llvm 5.0 branched relatively recently we started the llvm 5.0 upgrade in rust-lang/rust a week or so ago https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/43370 and it turned out that we didn't have many blockers on our end! much of the various bugs here and there have been fixed now and one of the last remaining pieces would be the llvm 5.0 upgrade for emscripten. we've got a small local commit https://github.com/rust-lang/llvm/commit/c9a21231adee1733a9ae5b2ba8c15c37576282a5 which adds the asmjs target to the llvm fork we've got, so we don't actually need to merge the fastcomp backend into our own fork. all of the llvm tools that emscripten uses, however, currently choke because we'd otherwise be producing llvm 5.0 bitcode tagged as such and emscriptens current llvm version 4.0 i believe rejects any bitcode generated by a future llvm rightfully so! i'm just opening this to track progress to upgrading to llvm 5.0, i'm not actually sure what's involved in doing that on this site! it's also worth pointing out that this isn't super urgent on our end. afaik there's not a huge amount of demand to upgrade rustc to llvm 5.0, it's just generally good to stay updated. i wanted to start early this time to shake out any regressions but that ended up not taking as long as expected!
