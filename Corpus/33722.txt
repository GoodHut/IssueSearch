 URL : "https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/595" TITLE : android wear support BODY : hello, i often have my smartwatch when i am walking and it could be nice to be able to complete some quests without having to take my phone out. i tried sideloading streetcomplete to my watch and the map works but clearly the interface could be improved to better fit such a small device. moreover questions & answers are too big to fit the screen. another issue is that android wear 1.5 does not have a virtual keyboard so quests that require typing can't be completed. ! screen https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/840125/30537658-d73d1c3e-9c6a-11e7-8055-da3e06975047.png ! screen2 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/840125/30537657-d7385654-9c6a-11e7-8e6b-2ecc2ce3a0d2.png
