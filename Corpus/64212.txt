 URL : "https://github.com/lmb-freiburg/flownet2/issues/37" TITLE : flow augmentation steps BODY : hi! steps from the flow augmentation layer comments: // step 1: apply inverse tranformation of image 1 // step 2: apply flow field // step 3: apply tranformation of image 2 // step 4: difference between the new and old positions gives the flow however, looking at the code it seems that transmat1 holds the spatial transformation matrix applied to image 1 and transmat2 holds the inverse of the spatial transformation matrix applied to image 2. so the code would then be applying the transformation of image 1, applying the flow field, then applying the inverse transformation of image 2. am i misreading the code or are the comments wrong? thanks!
