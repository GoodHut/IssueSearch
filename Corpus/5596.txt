 URL : "https://github.com/WoWManiaUK/Redemption/issues/877" TITLE : refer a friend BODY : referred accounts not able to summon each other until players are within targetable range. once this occurs, characters can summon each other for the remainder of the session until either loggs off. my experience on retail does not have this requirement. i am not sure if this is a bug or a working as intended feature
