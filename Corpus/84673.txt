BODY : hi, i've been using your egg hatching rng tool for a while now and it all works great for me, but a friend of mine found something odd. basically they tried using a few different search options, checking the generate using tsv and search tsv list matches check boxes checked respectively and came up with different results. in the tsv list, they only had 3 tsvs listed including the tsv they were searching for originally. here are a few images. first is searching for only the one tsv https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/292160433895505921/296841396998897664/untitled.png next is searching for the tsvs in their tsv list. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/292160433895505921/296841169554505728/untitled.png this last one is with both boxes checked. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/292160433895505921/296843203930488832/unknown.png each image i listed above has the first match for their 3141 tsv highlighted, so as it appears, the generate using tsv checkbox appears to give results for a match on frames much earlier than the other two images. just thought you might be interested. please contact me if you have any feedback or know why she might be getting different results. thanks again for all your help and hard work with the rng tool!
