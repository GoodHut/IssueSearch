 URL : "https://github.com/tsub/serverless-plugin-subscription-filter/issues/2" TITLE : downcompile with babel BODY : turns out this plugin doesn't run on older versions of node. i get an error when running on 4.3 actual lambda on aws version : > syntaxerror: unexpected token = i believe this is because the code in this plugin is only supported by newer versions of node unless you use babel. so it would be nice if you would down compile before publishing for use in older versions of node. i can try to hookup a pr tomorrow.
