 URL : "https://github.com/Avsecz/keras-hyperopt/issues/4" TITLE : multi-output model support BODY : as far as i understand from expressions such as np.arange min n_train, train 1 .shape 0 in test_fn , targets must be list/tuple right now, although they can be dict in keras to allow models with multiple outputs. so it would be nice to add dict target support, at some point. so i am adding this issue just as a todo item.
