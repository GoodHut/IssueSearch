 URL : "https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/issues/2591" TITLE : region capture issues BODY : i had to reinstall sharex, and after reinstalling i can't get the image editor to open. when i enable the quick task menu from the after capture tasks, the editor opens across all 3 of my monitors in full-screen mode. is there any way to disable this?i think that might be why the editor isn't opening.
