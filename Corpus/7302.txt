 URL : "https://github.com/greenaddress/GreenBits/issues/295" TITLE : fee cut in half BODY : i'm not sure if this is a problem with only custom fees or also with the other fee options. i was trying out greenbits today and sent a transaction where i put 270000 sat/kb as my custom fee. that fee was cut in half on the transaction, here is the hash: fbbaa43c51ee75441e5e787e45a3cbbaf898b7e19768191f9cc052eb0536b7b1 i believe this is a problem related to segwit enabled transactions, because a friend of mine reported the same issue on his ledger wallet, while this never happened to him before the upgrade of the wallet. also, please change the display to sat/b :
