 URL : "https://github.com/McJty/RFTools/issues/1248" TITLE : rftools -> jei issues BODY : i posted https://github.com/mezz/justenoughitems/issues/918 url to the jei github, having an odd issue with some recipes i autofill in a crafting card or a storage scanner using too many resources. the recipes themselves also display as using some items as stacks rather than single items. i've noticed the recipe issue with several mods, not just ones from rftools, just thought it may be worth posting this issue here as well. ! 2017-06-29_14 20 07 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29522189/27703972-04eba1e2-5cd7-11e7-8ccc-5aecd003839a.png ! 2017-06-29_14 20 20 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29522189/27703973-04f58cca-5cd7-11e7-92e5-55b48b10bcbc.png ! 2017-06-29_14 20 31 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29522189/27703974-04f849d8-5cd7-11e7-8e1a-71e28258517c.png ! 2017-06-29_14 20 52 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29522189/27703975-04f815a8-5cd7-11e7-8b97-f28ac1f3f886.png
