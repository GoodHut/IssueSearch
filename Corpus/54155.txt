 URL : "https://github.com/wfth/wo/issues/29" TITLE : fix admin side routing BODY : implementing phoenix.param on sermon series and sermons so we could slugify params had unexpected consequences. all the link helpers on the admin side now generate slug routes, which has completely mangled that side of the site. i'm not sure what we should do about it. i spent some time trying to fix it, but none of my solutions passing ids instead of structs to the helpers, creating a new model for sermon series, using slug routes, +++ are satisfactory. we need to look over this together @aiwilliams !
