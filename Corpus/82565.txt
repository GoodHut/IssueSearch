 URL : "https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss/issues/178" TITLE : age selex in readctl_3.24 BODY : when reading a ctl file with some age selex, lines 665 and 666 of readctl_3.24.r should i think change to paste0 ageespline_knot_ ,1:ctllist$age_selex_types j,4 , _ ,fleetnames j , _ ,j , paste0 ageespline_val_ ,1:ctllist$age_selex_types j,4 , _ ,fleetnames j , _ ,j instead of using size_selex_types to get the right number of parameters when building the labels. also, in line 146, when reading blocks, we have k0<-sum ctllist$age_selex_parms ,13 >0 +sum ctllist$size_selex_parms ,13 >0 but this not tell us, as far as i can see, how many rows to expect. in the case i am working with at the moment there are 9 blocks that change 2 parameters each, so k0 should be 18. i could not find a way yet to get the right number of rows from the information available in ctllist. maybe this will need some extra argument supplied by the user. @yukio-takeuchi
