 URL : "https://github.com/probot/probot/issues/207" TITLE : discussion: plugin api BODY : hey folks; i've been thinking about how plugins differ from using webhooks within a probot app, and i think that there is some friction around differentiating the two. currently, a plugin is a node module that is called like a function: js module.exports = robot => { myplugin {foo: 'bar'} ; } and that's cool, but it doesn't feel like a plugin, it feels more like a function call which really it is . webpack does this differently https://webpack.js.org/concepts/plugins/ configuration : js const config = { ... plugins: new webpack.optimize.uglifyjsplugin , new htmlwebpackplugin {template: './src/index.html'} }; do you folks think it could be a good idea to explore some kind of plugin configuration api like that? maybe something like but not exactly : js module.exports = robot => { robot.plugins new myplugin {foo: 'bar'} , ; } feel free to close this if you don't agree 👍
