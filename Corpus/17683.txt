 URL : "https://github.com/calvinbaart/rl-replay/issues/2" TITLE : received an error BODY : hello, when i parsed a replay file https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/337708713596944385/355455123708837890/0ada394f4c4945b680c47c80a7b81da6.replay , it returned the following: error: no mapping available for property 'tagame.camerasettingsactor_ta:busingsecondarycamera'. is there any particular reason why this has occurred? additionally, the machine that is running this replay parser is not on the same system as where rocket league is located. would that cause an issue? if the answer to the previous question is yes, is there a way for me to access the upload-replay from rocket league replays through an api. because i did not see an upload-replays api call on it. https://www.rocketleaguereplays.com/api/
