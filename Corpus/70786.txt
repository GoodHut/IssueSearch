 URL : "https://github.com/zom/Zom-iOS/issues/224" TITLE : zom upstream merge plan BODY : here's our current plan for the upstream merge, and some guidelines to make this process easier in the future: instead of using zom's develop https://github.com/zom/chatsecure-ios/commits/develop branch of the chatsecure-ios code, any zom branches that contain patches for the upstream chatsecure-ios repo will be labeled by a stable upstream tag, and the patches will always be rebased to be applied on top, if they aren't able to be merged upstream. for instance, if we have a v4.0.2 stable tag in the chatsecure ios repo, so the zom branch should be named 4.0.2-zom . when zom is ready to update to the v4.1 tag, we would create a 4.1-zom branch, and rebase the top commits from 4.0.2-zom . it would also make it a lot faster and easier to merge patches upstream via pull requests. we use a similar approach for our fork of jsq and name the branch 7.2.0-send_button , so we have a better idea of where the fork occurred and always see our patches as the most recent commits. once that rebase is complete, we anticipate needing some patches to the zom-ios app code because some public apis may have changed since the last merge. - rebase zom patches onto 4.0.2-zom branch - point to 4.0.2-zom in submodule - add patches to zom-ios app code to fix any breaking changes
