 URL : "https://github.com/mapseed/platform/issues/614" TITLE : mark reports as resolved BODY : we need a way to mark reports as resolved. for example this complaint has been fixed - http://heyduwamish.org/report/498 - i think it's a good idea to archive it gracefully, meaning, mark it in a why that symbolizes to the user that it's been fixed transparent graphic with a checkbox through it? but keep it there so people can know it was an issue and feel good that something has actually been resolved improves community morale .
