 URL : "https://github.com/gitburn/gitburn/issues/830" TITLE : the milestones to beta BODY : i created some pretty arbitrary milestones and threw all our beta issues in them. the goal is to ensure we're all on the same page about the work that is important and remains to be done. the milestones should remove the guesswork from picking what to work on next. they are by no means a complete breakdown of all the work between us and beta, but it's a start. i propose: 1. we work through the milestones one at a time, starting with m1. 2. we should generally only work on issues in the current milestone. 3. if you wanna add a new issue to a milestone or move an issue to a different milestone, comment in the issue and we'll talk about it as a team. 1. feel free to break big issues or features into smaller, more specific issues.
