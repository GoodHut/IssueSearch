 URL : "https://github.com/42BV/spring-script-hooks/issues/2" TITLE : add a timeout option BODY : the current blocking process reads the docker log and waits for the startup verification string to appear. as soon as this is found, it will unblock the process, allowing spring to continue. it will assume the docker postgres container has started. there are a couple of ways for the process to terminate and assume failure : any exception thrown during the tail process the fact that the docker thread has stopped the case that has not been checked is when the verification string is not found, yet the docker container does not stop. in this case, the tailer will run infinitely. it must be possible for the process to stop when the string has not been found. this should be based on a timeout. note that the timeout should not be set too low, since the very first run will trigger a download of the image. this will take time to complete.
