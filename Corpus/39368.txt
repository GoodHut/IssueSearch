 URL : "https://github.com/Shopkeepers/Shopkeepers/issues/470" TITLE : second trade failing BODY : migrated from: https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/shopkeepers/issues/530 originally posted by cindy_k jul 23, 2017 : we are having an issue with the second trade failing with the villagers.
we are only using admin villager shops.
the server is 1.12 with worldguard and griefprevention.
the villagers are in worldguard protection region, but are not in a griefprevention area.
â 
when a player goes to trade, they can get the first trade to work. â if they try to do a second trade, they can't take the item out of the villager screen.
i created a video of the issue.

â 
this is very frustrating since it looks like the trade are only working half the time.
â 
we have reviewed our config and can't find anything that would restrict players to only one trade at a time.â 
â 
thank you for your help!
