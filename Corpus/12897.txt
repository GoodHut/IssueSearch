 URL : "https://github.com/gabime/spdlog/issues/455" TITLE : short thread ids BODY : on osx, thread ids are long , like 3817087084462213816 . i wonder if there is a way to shorten them. hex is slightly shorter, but what i really want is just a low integer for each thread. something like this but fast and thread safe good luck with that! : int next_thread_short_id = 1; std::map<size_t, int> thread_short_ids; int getthreadshortid size_t thread_id { if thread_short_ids.count thread_id == 0 thread_short_ids thread_id = next_thread_short_id++; return thread_short_ids thread_id ; }
