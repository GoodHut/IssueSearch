 URL : "https://github.com/hswhite33/picturegame-bot/issues/2" TITLE : automatic win awarding BODY : think about ways to make the following work: - current host pm's the bot with the answer to the round - bot will now automatically give the win to the first person to say exactly the right answer, as well as listening for +corrects this is obviously not fool-proof, for example on rounds that need an explanation in the user's own words, or if spelling comes into play. so i would make the bot forward the answer onto the mods so that they could also do their usual business of +correcting if necessary. as an addition - it could be cool if the host also could provide a list of hints so that the bot could periodically give these out - although if the mods get forwarded the answer then they could give hints as people request them. this will not work with the current state machine implementation, so will only be possible if/when the multiprocess bot is finished.
