 URL : "https://github.com/Clinical-Genomics/deliver/issues/40" TITLE : add rnaseq linking BODY : then the vague plan would be: fastq files would be linked to ~~/rnaseq/projects/$lims_project_id/$sample_id/$fastq_file $fastq_files would be: ${sample_id}_${flowcell}_${lane}_${readdirection}.fastq.gz add function is_rnaseq to cglims.apptag fast route: create an extra 'module' in deliver to be able to link rnaseq samples to above mentioned structure best route: abstract away linking of samples in such way that one links a sample/project/case/flowcell and the package figures out where the samples go based on apptag
