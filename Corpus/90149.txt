 URL : "https://github.com/andrewgaul/s3proxy/issues/180" TITLE : s3proxy thread management BODY : presently s3proxy uses the default jetty thread pool. s3proxy should cap the maximum threads at some value to avoid exhausting resources. s3proxy should also gracefully handle backpressure in this situation, returning 503 when clients exhaust the thread pool. note that this issue requires more investigation of how jetty works since it likely provides this functionality but s3proxy needs to configure it. previous discussion in 170. @kishore25kumar
