BODY : very hard to explain, but instead of particle effects on some enemies or corpses or gibs flying through the air, i get white edged blocks over the gibs or the particle effect itself. another example is an imp throwing a fireball and the fireball actually becomes a white block and follows the same behavior as the particle effect would. it's not ever single time, but very often...usually every other encounter or more. i exceed all of the requirements i7/plenty of ram/gtx 1080/did this on the last driver and the newest driver...would not know before that as i just installed this game last night, but have used 2 different video drivers with same results.
