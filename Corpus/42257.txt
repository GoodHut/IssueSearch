 URL : "https://github.com/USDA/USDA-APIs/issues/49" TITLE : api for food labeling BODY : i was wondering if there's an api available for the food labeling i.e., organic , non-gmo , etc that the usda manages? it would be great if this could be included in responses from the ndb, but a separate api would also be totally fine.
