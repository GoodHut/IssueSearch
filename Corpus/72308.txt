 URL : "https://github.com/bluelinelabs/Conductor/issues/296" TITLE : bottom sheets components BODY : after digging through the conductor samples , i noticed that there is no dialog fragments. it's just another controller with just style and layout changes and it hides the entire background view navigates to other controller with big paddings around .i am looking to build and equivalent of bottom sheets components with help of controller.on the ux side, the user will have option to choose from a list of items from the bottom of the view. i am looking to keep the background transparent and the bottom sheet should animate from bottom. it would be great if anyone can share some samples
