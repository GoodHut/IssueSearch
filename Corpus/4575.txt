 URL : "https://github.com/w3ctag/capability-urls/issues/10" TITLE : easier to leak BODY : maybe it's worth mentioning that capability urls guarding some kind of secret are easier to leak with third parties than urls with credentialed access. as credentialed access points directly back to the leaker. that doesn't prevent a motivated leaker, but it goes back to urls being easy to share and are therefore not the best place to place secrets. see https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/09/12/locking-it-all-down for a recent case.
