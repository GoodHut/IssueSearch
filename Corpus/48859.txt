 URL : "https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2027" TITLE : spi interfacing issue BODY : hi @ll, i couldn't find any information about the spi interface and octopi, is it somehow disabled generally? what i try to do is controlling a ws2801 rgb-led stripe with the same raspi i'm using to print with. actually it's no big deal and i'm runnig these ws2801 on several other raspis without issues. so, are the gpio-spi-pins 10,9,11 or board 19,21,23 disabled for some reason? i'm using the adafruit-ws2801 python library, no errors, but no light.
