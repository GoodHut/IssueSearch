 URL : "https://github.com/VoltDB/voltdb-client-nodejs/issues/21" TITLE : voltdb table create fails BODY : i am unable to run tow sql queries in a single transaction. here is my query: drop table deviceping if exists; create table deviceping deviceid integer ,rideid bigint ,latitude float ,longitude float ,speed float ,bearing float ,angle float ,horizontalerror float ,verticalerror float ,temprature float ,ignition tinyint ,motion tinyint ,relaystate tinyint ,timestamp bigint ; i can't see the table created in voltdb web monitor interface, whereas if i remove drop table statement, the table creation succeeds. i have read in the documentation that ddl and dml statements can't be executed in the same transaction, but this two query comes under ddl. what is going wrong?
