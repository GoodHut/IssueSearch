 URL : "https://github.com/alekbarszczewski/knex-hooks/issues/4" TITLE : helpers for where clauses? BODY : hi, i wanted to add a couple of hooks to one of my tables that would substitute a hashid http://hashids.org/ in place of the numerical id automatically. it doesn't yet seem possible with this library. is there any plans to add the necessary capabilities i.e. modifying where clause parameters ?
