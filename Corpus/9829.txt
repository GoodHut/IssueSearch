 URL : "https://github.com/Cognexa/cxtream/issues/33" TITLE : add keep dropper BODY : i find very annoying to drop every column i temporarly create. it would be a nice feature to specify the columns to keep instead of dropping the useless ones. e.g. i have columns a,b,c,d,e,f,g and want to keep only a,b : // current stream | drop<c,d,e,f,g> // proposed stream | keep<a,b> this would be useful in the end of the streams on in case of reusing some stream parts no idea what sources are provided
