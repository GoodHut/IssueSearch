 URL : "https://github.com/gregversteeg/corex_topic/issues/7" TITLE : not getting enough topics BODY : i tried running corex_topic with a training matrix of size approx 100,000x10,000. i ran corex with settings n_hidden=1000, max_iter=1000 but only about 200 of them were non-empty. this could be a symptom of my data, of course and perhaps there are only 200 topics , but are there other parameters that could be tuned to generate way more? thanks.
