 URL : "https://github.com/mskcc/vcf2maf/issues/140" TITLE : vcf version change BODY : when i run vcf2maf.pl, i get a warning, the version 4.2 not supported, assuming vcfv4.1 the script seems to run fine, i just wanted to ensure that this is not a problem. also, given the different coordinate systems between vcf/maf/ensemble formats, are these accounted for in the resulting maf file?
