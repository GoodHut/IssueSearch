 URL : "https://github.com/BurntSushi/rust-csv/issues/91" TITLE : parse rows on demand? BODY : i'm trying to use rust-csv in an async context and have troubles getting this done with the reader - maybe there is a way to improve the api ? or i am missing anything . so i'm consuming a futures::stream and want to map a line of string which would be my csv line into a hashmap of the parsed one. so my question is: is there a way to setup rust-csv with all the params and then push/consume lines in as they come in and consume the parsed output? thanks, michael
