 URL : "https://github.com/geoffreychiou/IC2/issues/29" TITLE : output inverse of result BODY : the getresult method for cameraonwristextrinsic currently returns a result struct which contains: c++ struct result { double extrinsics 6 ; double target_to_base 6 ; }; this can be potentially confusing if it is not made clear what extrinsics is exactly. the result struct should contain something like: c++ struct result { double camera_to_tool 6 ; double tool_to_camera 6 ; double target_to_base 6 ; double base_to_target 6 ; pose6d camera_to_tool; pose6d tool_to_camera; pose6d target_to_base; pose6d base_to_targetl; }; conversions between the two can be done inside of the getresult method. this way the user doesn't have to perform any inversions themselves.
