 URL : "https://github.com/d3/d3-path/issues/13" TITLE : access to relative paths BODY : hello, this module builds svg paths using absolute commands m, z, h, v, .. . would it make sense for d3 to have an api to be able to build relative paths using m, z, h, v, .. ? i am currently using both d3-path which has a nice arc api and https://www.npmjs.com/package/svg-path-generator which has a relative facility and trying to see how to go forward to have a unified path generator. my need for relatives path does not really come out of d3 so i would understand if the design goals of d3-path do not emcompass this feature. i am trying to generate shape paths for a laser cutter and it is easier to reason about with relative positions.
