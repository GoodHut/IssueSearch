 URL : "https://github.com/audi/audi-ui/issues/11" TITLE : importing with angular 2 BODY : we have the following problem with using the audi-ui in our angular 2 project. installing via: npm install @audi/audi-ui works fine. after that it is existing in the node_modules folder, and in the package json the following line is added. @audi/audi-ui : ^1.0.0-alpha.1 , so importing import aui from 'audi-ui'; should work, but it doesnt. it returns: > cannot find module 'audi-ui' . did someone have the same problem? and how did you solve this issue?
