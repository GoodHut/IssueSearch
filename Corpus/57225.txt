 URL : "https://github.com/minetest-mods/technic/issues/355" TITLE : power supply balancing BODY : imho infinite power sources eg. watermill, solar array are too powerful relative to not infinite ones like fuel fired generator or nuclear reactor . also solar arrays and panels are too strongly affected by place hight pos.y . i wouldn't make the non infinite power sources stronger but the infinite ones weaker since technic power seems to be a bit cheap.
