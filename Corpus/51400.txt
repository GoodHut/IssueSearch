 URL : "https://github.com/JakeWharton/pidcat/issues/146" TITLE : allow input from stdin BODY : feature request device logs don't always come directly from adb. it would be nice to be able to pass in a previously-acquired log for formatting. example possible usage: taking input from stdin: pidcat < ~/desktop/logs/crash_dump.txt taking input as an argument: pidcat -l ~/desktop/logs/crash_dump.txt
