 URL : "https://github.com/mefistotelis/phantom-firmware-tools/issues/24" TITLE : mi14 sonar module BODY : i have been reversing the mvom0fw.bin file that has been doing the rounds as fw downgrader. it looks to be very similar to the mi15 binary file your tool extracts matching strings i am 99.9% sure that the target chip is a nuvoton m051 cortex m0+ . it lives on the ofdm board, i am waiting for a sample of that hw to arrive but in the meantime can anyone confirm? mvom0fw.bin seems to work its downgrade magic by erasing a 64 byte area of the mcus flash, i haven't reversed it 100% yet tho
