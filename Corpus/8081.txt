 URL : "https://github.com/Clinical-Genomics/scout/issues/430" TITLE : missing hgnc id BODY : i found a gene in nmd panel which has been added without having an exiting entry in our internal gene database! when you export the panel scout produces an error - we should probably check if every hgnc id in a panel exists in our database before loading it, right? second question is why this gene is not in our database: http://www.genenames.org/cgi-bin/gene_symbol_report?hgnc_id=hgnc:39080 ☹️
