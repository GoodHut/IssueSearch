 URL : "https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/8957" TITLE : enhance curly option BODY : the curly rule should have a new option that works like multi, but enforces braces around if-else and switch-case: what rule do you want to change? curly does this change cause the rule to produce more or fewer warnings? depends on how will the change be implemented? new option, new default behavior, etc. ? new option please provide some example code that this change will affect: this should be correct code with the new option: js while foo { // bad with multi if bar warn sd ; else warn sd ; } // bad with multi if foo { // bad with multi switch n { case 10: return 1; case 20: foo ; } } // bad with multi this code is correct with the option multi and should also be correct with the new option: js while foo for let bar; bar > 0; bar++ if foobar dosomething ; what does the rule currently do for this code? see behaviour with curly: warn , multi above // bad with multi what will the rule do after it's changed? behave like the multi option but enforce curlies around if-else and switch-case. see above this is needed, because omitting the curly for simple statements improves readability and reduces loc, but for things like if-else or switch-case, the curly is needed for readability.
