 URL : "https://github.com/mrlesmithjr/docker-ansible-phpipam/issues/4" TITLE : three little things BODY : hi, i'm using your docker image, it seems to work fine, except of three things: 1. manual scanning using fping causes a json error invalid json response - json_error_syntax 2. fping scanning doesn't work in generell, fping is located in /bin/fping 3. backing up the database from your container, there's a database named test , this causes errors during backup, cause phpipam user has no privileges - i manually dropped this database, backup is ok now do you know about this errors?
