BODY : hey, first of all, let me thank you for your codes, they're more useful than you think! my name is cristián irribarra i'm an astrophysics student at universidad católica de chile. i'm currently on the crusade of developing a machine learning algorithm capable of identifying exoplanets in lightcurves from kepler k2 mission, and found your codes useful for teaching the neural network the pattern recognition. i'm currently taking a look at your codes, and would like to help if you are interested in replicating the detrend algorithm that one can use inside the game, this because the lightcurves pipeline delivers a median-filtered applied plot, so maybe this way detrending could help in the nn's succesfull training. hope you find this little proyect fun of being part of, so maybe we can collab! best wishes, and happy coding. cristián irribarra.
