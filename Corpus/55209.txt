 URL : "https://github.com/almighty/almighty-core/issues/1063" TITLE : improve our test suite BODY : - add the call to populatecommons as part of the test suite migration or similar. could be a different call then migrate, but we would want to do it as part of the test suite - create a little 'dummy' database with a few things in each table that is imported into the db before the migration is ran. so we can test with some real data in there.
