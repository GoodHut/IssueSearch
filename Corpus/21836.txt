 URL : "https://github.com/karify/external-svg-sprite-loader/issues/35" TITLE : hash is not stable BODY : i've run into an issue with the usage of hash . it's not stable, i.e. it does not produce consistent results. multiple builds -> different hashes. this breaks long term caching. i'm also running into a problem where client and server compilation passes are running in different processes and produce different hashes for the exact same code. the results in the ssr pass emitting incorrect asset paths that then break client hydration react . i'm going to suggest a fix for this.
