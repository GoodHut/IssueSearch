 URL : "https://github.com/Paratii-Video/paratii-design/issues/1" TITLE : ux for error handling BODY : we need some way/place to show errors. here is a list of things that can go wrong when sendign a transaction to the blockchain. i've taken the buying of a video as an example : - no connection to the blockchain - no local wallet - wrong password - you don't have enough eth to pay for transaction costs - you don't have enough pti to pay for this video - timeout errors - you sent the transaction, but it is not beging processed - this video is not available/registered on the blockchain - this video is availalbe, but its price has just changed and _now_ yhou dont have enough pti - some uknown error occurred on the node question: where and how are we showing such errors? perhaps a useful distinction: there are synchronous errors that can be reported immediately wrong pass, nto enough funds, etc and asynchronous errors that only occur after a certain time i.e. the processing errors
