 URL : "https://github.com/americool/vndr_ideas/issues/27" TITLE : new refactor needed BODY : https://github.com/americool/vndr_ideas/blob/calc-distance/src/form.js in the submitnewvendor function - i had tried pulled out all the logic to calculate the distance and modify the vendor coordinates into a separate function which ended by setting the state of distance to calcdistance and then just pushed it in the original submitnewvendor function. the only issue was calling both of these functions from the onpress on the submit button. seemed to not be responsive. couldn't remember how to do that right.
