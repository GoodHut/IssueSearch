 URL : "https://github.com/guardian/guss-rem/issues/11" TITLE : add to npm BODY : hey, i'm still using guss-rem but i've been trying to reduce the amount of dependency management i have to do. i find myself only using bower to use this plugin, as almost everything else has either been moved to npm or also registered themselves on npm. would you be willing to add guss-rem to npm? paul
