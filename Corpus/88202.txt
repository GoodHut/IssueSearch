 URL : "https://github.com/stella-emu/stella/issues/274" TITLE : ms. pacman unstable image BODY : the attached rom runs differently in stella compared to real hardware. in particular, every so often, the screen displays only half an image, and the scanline count jumps to 148 or so. it seems to be an interaction with either vsync or wsync, but i haven't researched any further. testing on real hardware light sixer doesn't give the same output, but the image still jumps very slightly every now and then, under the same conditions as above. so it looks like whatever is causing the issue on real hardware is being amplified in stella. testing shows similar behaviour but not as severe in stellerator, and both javatari and z26 have an unstable image too. so it seems the rom is doing something strange. initial report from atariage: http://atariage.com/forums/topic/252919-ms-pac-man-inprovements mspac-man_ntsc.zip https://github.com/stella-emu/stella/files/1583519/mspac-man_ntsc.zip
