 URL : "https://github.com/ioam/param/issues/166" TITLE : decide about cythonizing BODY : currently, pip install/python setup.py attempts to cythonize. this may bring performance improvements e.g. when creating many parameterized objects , although we have no performance tests running to back that up https://github.com/ioam/param/issues/165 . however, there are a number of potential downsides of cythonizing: 1 source code is obscured/people might think it's not purely python e.g. if they try to open the file they've imported; 2 possible errors/incompatibilities introduced by cython we're not aware of although you could also argue cythonizing helps catch a class of problems, and also cythonizing by default means we're all testing cython's effects all the time ; 3 possible installation failures e.g. https://github.com/ioam/param/issues/129 or confusion e.g. https://github.com/ioam/param/issues/161 ; 4 just more stuff to think about overall. incidentally, conda packages have never included cythonized param. people would only have the cythonized version by pip install/python setup.py from pypi/github on a machine with cython and a working compiler.
