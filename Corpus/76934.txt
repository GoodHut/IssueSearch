 URL : "https://github.com/angular-pakistan/ngpakistan.com/issues/6" TITLE : meetup resources section BODY : must haves: - user should be able to access all meetup videos youtube & dailymotion - user should be able to access all meetup presentations - user should be able like or dislike a video or presentation. we need to keep it super simple with 2 generic reactions 👍 and 👎 - user should be able to share a video or presentation from the website to facebook and twitter. we can add other social networks later. extras: user should be able to add comments to any resource. we need to evaluate between a simple disqus integration or building our own simple comment box. if we end up building our own comment box, it should just be a vanilla version. for example, no nested comments. for custom commenting, we then need to implement facebook/twitter/google auth for user authentication. this can be version 2 of meetup resources section task.
