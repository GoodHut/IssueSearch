BODY : all the documentation i can find says i need a 5v buzzer but it's not clear if this is supposed to be an _active_ or _passive_ buzzer. links to ebay and amazon will have both, and they look similar. the pictures look more like an active buzzer which only is capable of producing one tone i thinnk? , but i would think you would need a passive one. i am unsure, any clarification?
