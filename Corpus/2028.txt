 URL : "https://github.com/clappr/clappr-stats/issues/20" TITLE : pr new stats BODY : after talking with @lucasrodcosta he asked me to post a pr here. i worked a bit to ouput latency and current buffer i'm not a dev so i do my best but i'm sure there are better ways to do it current buffer hls.on hls.events.level_loaded,function event,data { var pos = video.currenttime; var bufferlen = video.buffered.end 0 - pos; console.log 'current buffer : ' + bufferlen.tofixed 2 + ' seconds' ; } ; => i detected an issue about current buffer in my code but i don't know yet how to fix it : when encoder is started if i stop it then restart it, value begins to be negative because of video.buffered.end 0 which is frozen to a very small value 0.0x latency it needs ext-x-program-date-time header hls.on hls.events.level_loaded,function event,data { var current = video.currenttime; var frag = data.details.fragments 0 .start; var tps = current - frag; var now = new date ; var unixnow = date.parse now /1000; var tunix = date.parse data.details.fragments 0 .rawprogramdatetime /1000; var latence = unixnow - tunix - tps; console.log 'latency : ' + latence.tofixed 2 + ' seconds' ; } ; i made some tests and it works rather well. nico
