 URL : "https://github.com/zagaberoo/diode/issues/65" TITLE : handle locked threads BODY : first obvious way is to disable the 'reply' button for locked threads. i'm wondering about the visual indication though. i've got a version showing the lock emoji ðŸ”’ next to the comments count at the top, but i don't think it's necessarily big enough. i was thinking that it could have a similar banner like the viewing a single comment's context banner. any thoughts?
