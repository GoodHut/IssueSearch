 URL : "https://github.com/dkanada/ICEcons/issues/64" TITLE : use svg icons from ameixa BODY : @dkanada @ikocevski i just noticed that the ameixa cm/los icon pack https://gitlab.com/xphnx/twelf_cm12_theme by xphnx https://gitlab.com/xphnx already has lots of svg icons https://gitlab.com/xphnx/twelf_cm12_theme/tree/master/svgs/depot . unfortunately, there are quite bloated every icon more than 60 kb, of which only 2kb are needed ; so you can't extract the relevant icon path easily . i spent some time on that lots of steps necessary... and i'm almost finished. please have a look on the svg files in the attached zip file https://github.com/dkanada/icecons/files/1166469/ameixa_optim.zip ! we could easily use them by copy-pasting them onto the circle/square/rectangle template and substracting this could also be automated .
