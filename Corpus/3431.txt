 URL : "https://github.com/adrifcastr/NTRDB-Plugin-Host/issues/1" TITLE : pkmn sumo plg BODY : dunno exactly where you are pulling your pkmn sumo plugins from unless they are ones you created yourself, but if your pulling them from this thread http://gbatemp.net/threads/release-pok%c3%a9mon-sumocheatmenu-supports-o3ds.455365/ then there should be 2 versions for n3ds and o3ds. 1 for sun and 1 for moon, so in total you should have 4 plugins in total for sumo.
