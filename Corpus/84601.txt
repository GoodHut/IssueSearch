 URL : "https://github.com/diegohaz/arc/issues/172" TITLE : deploying in aws question BODY : i am a bit confused on how to deploy this application in aws ec elastic bean setup since i am relatively new to this. front end static files usually have a index.html file to point to while vanilla node.js applications have a server.js/app.js or www/bin ... where can i read up on how to deploy this application? there are two js files in dist folder... what do i do with them? sorry if this is a noob question, just point me to where i can figure this out as i am unfamiliar with this setup. thanks!
