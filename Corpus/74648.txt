BODY : i'm trying to solve a crash that occurred in my code last night and i'm hoping that switching to the arrow library may fix my problem. i've written a test script to confirm arrow's behavior during the dst transition and i think there may be a bug in my logic or in arrow. the attached test script is generating the following output. notice that when the transition happens, i get a time delta that looks like about 47 hours: d=2017-11-05t01:59:54.990000-05:00, d2=2017-11-05t01:59:55.985000-05:00, delta=0:00:00.995000 d=2017-11-05t01:59:55.985000-05:00, d2=2017-11-05t01:59:56.993000-05:00, delta=0:00:01.008000 d=2017-11-05t01:59:56.993000-05:00, d2=2017-11-05t01:59:57.996000-05:00, delta=0:00:01.003000 d=2017-11-05t01:59:57.996000-05:00, d2=2017-11-05t01:59:59-05:00, delta=0:00:01.004000 d=2017-11-05t01:59:59-05:00, d2=2017-11-05t01:00:00.011000-05:00, delta= -1 day, 23:00:01.011000 d=2017-11-05t01:00:00.011000-05:00, d2=2017-11-05t01:00:01.012000-05:00, delta=0:00:01.001000 d=2017-11-05t01:00:01.012000-05:00, d2=2017-11-05t01:00:02.014000-05:00, delta=0:00:01.002000 d=2017-11-05t01:00:02.014000-05:00, d2=2017-11-05t01:00:03.019000-05:00, delta=0:00:01.005000 d=2017-11-05t01:00:03.019000-05:00, d2=2017-11-05t01:00:04.034000-05:00, delta=0:00:01.015000 dst_test.zip https://github.com/crsmithdev/arrow/files/1444239/dst_test.zip
