 URL : "https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/issues/2894" TITLE : no docs on plugin api BODY : at http://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/dev/plugins.html there are no docs on the api. seems like each should list what is required instead of just listing examples. from karma-coffee-preprocessor https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-coffee-preprocessor/blob/master/index.js what is: line 5 what are all the objects passed in as arguments and how are they selected $inject line 51 'config.coffeepreprocessor' line 51 how would i know to do that ... line 51 'preprocessor:coffee' line 55 'factory' line 55 what options are there? basically need to how the initializer works needs to be defined then the function returned needs docs.
