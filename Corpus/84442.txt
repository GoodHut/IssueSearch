 URL : "https://github.com/nessieisreal/nessie-python-sdk/issues/1" TITLE : customer account endpoint BODY : ac: a user of the python sdk can use any api associated with the customer account endpoint. user will supply their own api key, and the sdk will utilize classes and objects e.g. an account class as a layer of abstraction so that even a lowly college freshman can feel comfortable using nessie. we've decided to tackle this in an object oriented way, so look at the android and node sdks for inspiration. remember to use python3 and not python2. more info on the different apis for the account endpoint: http://api.reimaginebanking.com/documentation !/account/
