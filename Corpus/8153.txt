 URL : "https://github.com/Stenlan/BaBSS/issues/1" TITLE : needs a license BODY : this needs an open source license, mainly so people can freely contribute to it legally. right now, without a license, all rights are reserved to you, and in most countries it is illegal for someone to modify it without your written consent or even copy it, tho i'm pretty sure putting it on github gives people the rights to download and view . please do not use the gpl or any other fsf license! the pandas will cry :- en masse.
