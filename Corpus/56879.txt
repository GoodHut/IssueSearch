 URL : "https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/issues/1592" TITLE : order of documentation BODY : am i missing something or is the order of documentation a little strange on this page: https://material.io/components/web/docs/ getting started is in the middle, and authoring components is at the top. surely getting started should come first and authoring components at the bottom?
