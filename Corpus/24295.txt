 URL : "https://github.com/tgriesser/knex/issues/2001" TITLE : slow query logging BODY : is there a way to log instrument slow queries and slow transactions with knex? i know setting debug=knex will enable detailed logging, but it'd be nice if there was something that lets me report on timings directly within the code, rather than having to parse the logs. does something like this exist? like a way to hook before/after queries?
