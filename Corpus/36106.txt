 URL : "https://github.com/WFCD/warframe-nexus-query/issues/14" TITLE : fuzzy search - nexus BODY : hey! just added a way to perform full fuzzy searches instead of partial string matches. think your users will appreciate that for things like auto-corrections. example url: https://api.nexus-stats.com/warframe/v1/search?query=aklstletto&fuzzy=true&category=items about the url: keep in mind that you need to specify the category items/players . it's a lot more cpu intensive on large datasets, so we need to restrict it to one at a time. edited the old url will work just like before about the output: we return the full item data by default this time. when performing fuzzy searches, you'll also see a _score and _matches key. the score is the accuracy percentage, the matches describe which parts of the string have been identified. might be useful for things like input highlighting
