 URL : "https://github.com/UnlikeSuika/UnlikeBot/issues/1" TITLE : bot is lacking memes BODY : after using the bot for a bit, i noticed some critical issues. there are commands that are designated for memes. for example, the bot responds 'lmao' when a user types the string 'ayy'. this is a great feature but overall, the bot still lacks some high-quality memes which really undermines the user experience. the product quality could be drastically improved by introducing more dank and spicy memes. i recommend making these changes immediately.
