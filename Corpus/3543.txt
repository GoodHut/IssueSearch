 URL : "https://github.com/kjnilsson/fez/issues/15" TITLE : rfc 1: arrays BODY : arrays have no direct equivalent in core erlang . a lot of code that uses arrays can be quite directly translated to using lists instead fsharp list s or seq s . the exception to this is code that mutates the array directly. that said a lot of code may use arrays and it would be good to cover arrays in some shape or form. the most direct equivalent of erlang's binary type is the byte array so it would make sense to translate operations on byte arrays to operations on binaries. arrays are generic so this leave a lot of types uncovered. should the non mutable aspects and apis of array. that aren't byte arrays simply be translated as erlang lists? are there any other options?
