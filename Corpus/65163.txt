BODY : hi, i want to have a control flow graph from an android apk then assign weight to its nodes or edges. the goal is having a weighted cfg which i can prioritize traversing its paths. i know that i should use unit as a node of my cfg. apparently, each unit equals to a statement in android program as the unit is an interface class.the first question is, where can i find the implementation of this interface? i wanna to add an integer field weigh to each unit since i know that we can not add field to an interface ug in the code below: infoflowcfg icfg = new infoflowcfg ; directedgraph<unit> ug = icfg.getorcreateunitgraph targetmethod ; iterator<unit> uit = ug.iterator ;
