 URL : "https://github.com/plum-umd/monadic-eval/issues/40" TITLE : use author+year citations BODY : > for extensible interpreters 18, 23, 25 : i have no idea what those references are. could you please use a citation style that gives the last name of the authors in full and the publication year name? it does take a bit more space, but it is so much more convenient for readers... likely required for final version anyway.
