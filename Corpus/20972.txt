 URL : "https://github.com/wix/react-native-calendars/issues/225" TITLE : disable date range BODY : description i would like to be able to say that every date before today, should be disabled. there is the disabledbydefault, and disabled on the markeddate, but i want basically to have disabled everything before date x, and enabled after date x, inclusive. expected behavior to have a prop like disabledrange or disabledbefore. observed behavior i think there is nothing like that.
