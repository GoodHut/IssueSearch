 URL : "https://github.com/ngageoint/seed/issues/11" TITLE : devise versioning scheme BODY : we need to have a better way to handle versions of the spec if we are going to have broader adoption - presently we just use the last build and all previously compiled versions are lost. we could update the gh-pages repo to link to all versions and inject the version based on tag as part of the travis build.
