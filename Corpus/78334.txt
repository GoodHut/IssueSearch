 URL : "https://github.com/EFForg/phantom-of-the-capitol/issues/100" TITLE : problem configuring cors BODY : i'm having trouble with cross origin requests. on my host, i'm running a python server that serves my application on port 8000, plus a vagrant instance of phantom of the capitol on port 9292. before running rackup i edited config/phantom-dc_config.rb and phantom-dc_config.rb.example to set this line: cors_allowed_domains = 'http://localhost:8000' curl requests work fine, but if i run a browser that does a cross-origin preflight check e.g. options on chrome then it fails with a http status code of 405, method not allowed. my outgoing request's origin matches what i've set in the config file. i tried setting and exporting cors_allowed_domains in the environment, but i get the same result. does anyone have any thoughts about what i am doing wrong here?
