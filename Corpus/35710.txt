 URL : "https://github.com/adambisek/string-pixel-width/issues/5" TITLE : export as es5 module BODY : today many build config does not support es6 modules because it uses an old version of uglify. this is the case for create-react-app see here https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/readme.md npm-run-build-fails-to-minify until uglify-es use spreads see here https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/2108 , would it be possible to distribute this lib as an es5 module ?
