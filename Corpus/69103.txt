 URL : "https://github.com/Ericsson/codechecker/issues/565" TITLE : store system statistics BODY : it could be useful if, for an analysis, we stored which version of clang and clang-tidy was used for analysis. also if we are already modifying the database and interface to accompany the storage of this metadata, showing the version of codechecker on the web interface and in the help command would also be nice.
