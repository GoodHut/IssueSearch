 URL : "https://github.com/nextcloud/vm/issues/402" TITLE : blank https:// page. BODY : i did write this issue before also. after installing with this script nextcloud can't show in the webbbrowser, the page is just blank white . my guess is that the script are installing as root and then when the server runs with the default user it don't has the right permissions to show the pages.
