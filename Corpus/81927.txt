 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/issues/470" TITLE : adaptive card auto scroll BODY : i have an adaptive card with three buttons. the 'support option' button opens another card that gives the user two more buttons to choose from. unfortunately when i click on the button - the card opens below but my window does not scroll down automatically to show the rest of the card. i have to scroll down to see the rest of my card. on the reverse, if i am scrolled to the bottom of the card and then collapse the showcard button my window auto scrolls perfectly. if your card expands it is my opinion that the screen should scroll to the bottom of the card. ! image https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14949544/26253597/c9f37f4e-3c68-11e7-9c48-c99895feb5a5.png
