 URL : "https://github.com/jaredly/django-colorfield/issues/37" TITLE : minimum working example? BODY : heyo! i decided to give a go at adding the ability to do selection of a specific colorset, and what i thought would be quick is turning into a nightmare : i can't get even the most basic case working - a list of issues: - installation with an egg doesn't properly add templates unless the template loader is active - i never got the static files to be added from colorfields - it's not actually clear how to render the template, and interact in views i have most of a dockerized image in the example folder here, and it would be really great to get a clean base /dummy app working so the additional features can be developed. i'm a bit frustrated so taking a break for now, thanks for your help! https://github.com/vsoch/django-colorfield/tree/color-limits
