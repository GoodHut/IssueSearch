 URL : "https://github.com/inspirehep/inspire-next/issues/1987" TITLE : speed up acceptance tests BODY : acceptance tests are the slowest part of our testing matrix 17min vs ~10 min for the next slowest one . some suggestions to make them faster: aggregate several assertions in the same test . for example for author form tests https://github.com/inspirehep/inspire-next/blob/master/tests/acceptance/test_author_creation.py we have many small tests that each have to open the browser/login/go to the form page and then they just test one input field. would be better to aggregate all the assertions regarding the form in one test. avoid repetition . for example for author form tests https://github.com/inspirehep/inspire-next/blob/master/tests/acceptance/test_author_creation.py test_submit_author , test_accept_author , test_reject_author , test_curation_author and test_review_submission_author they all do exactly the same long process of go to main page/login/go to form/fill form/go and wait in holding pen/access detail holding pen and make sure values are there . since the input is always the same, checking once is enough. make sure tests run fast . for some reason tests like this one https://github.com/inspirehep/inspire-next/blob/master/tests/acceptance/test_author_creation.py l74 or this one https://github.com/inspirehep/inspire-next/blob/master/tests/acceptance/test_author_creation.py l86 get stuck and take long to complete see example below of test_orcid_format . other tests like the autocomplete test execute fast. ! slow-test https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/580727/23661905/de30402a-0345-11e7-941d-cd5c4793c611.gif
