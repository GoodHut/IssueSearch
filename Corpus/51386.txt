 URL : "https://github.com/ARM-software/ComputeLibrary/issues/173" TITLE : alexnet mali profiling BODY : i have created the alexnet app using armcompute mali library. the app displays the camera preview along with alexnet outputs after processing. so the problem here is alexnet processing fps keeps on varying from 4 to 8 fps and not constant . is this expected behaviour. note : i am using gettimeofday to check the profiling . mobile i am using is samsung galaxy note5. thanks in advance.
