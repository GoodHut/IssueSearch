 URL : "https://github.com/Tarrasch/zsh-bd/issues/16" TITLE : bd into cwd is meaningless BODY : i dont think bd should accept current dir as an argument, though this sounds like not bad, but sometimes confused me. for example, when i am in: ~/bin/foobar/bin and enter: bd bin i meant go to ~/bin because that is the first matching parent dir, but bd just let me go to cwd means nothing happened so does the completion, shouldn't show the cwd entry
