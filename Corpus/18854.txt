 URL : "https://github.com/mantidproject/mantidimaging/issues/95" TITLE : use click for cli BODY : the level of subcommands/composition here would really warrant use of a more appropriate cli library. click allows easier subcommand nesting e.g. mantidimaging -i some/files -o some/more/files filter background_correction --dark path/dark --flat path/flat , handles dispatch for you and would do away with most of the functional config and cli registration. it would be a fair bit of work and may not be worthwhile, however is something to consider.
