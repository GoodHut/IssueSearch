 URL : "https://github.com/DreamBlocks/DreamBlocks/issues/44" TITLE : newgamemenu + startmenu BODY : the game menu is divided into two very similar classes: newgamemenu and startmenu. the main game menu is divided into 2 different phases: - home screen - second screen after pressing the new button. i would like to unify the newgamemenu and startmenu class to simplify the customization of the game menu. or i can post comments to the code to remember all the steps. new collaborators reading reviews will have easy life. comments are important! we comment on the code as i did at the beginning. i probably realized a new package devoted to these two classes. i want to keep everything in order, and separate the menu from the rest of the project. i'm working on the new buttons, and the new header. if you have good ideas, tips and more, i would be happy to share your thoughts. thank you.
