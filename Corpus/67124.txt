 URL : "https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/432" TITLE : other jquery selectors? BODY : are there plans to add other jquery traversal methods? i ran into a case where nextall would have been nice, but it isn't available. my use case was a calendar that has very little selectors in the dom. i needed to pick the next day of the week in the month. what i was looking to do was: js cy.get '.calendar' .find '.selected' .parent .nextall .ep 6 .click ; but i ended up having to do additional foot work. js cy .get '.calendar' .find '.selected' .parent .then function $today { _.times 7, function { $today = $today.next ; } ; return $today; } .click ; i mean it's fine this way.. i think i _can_ do anything without the methods.. and i can certainly understand if the idea is to keep the api small.. but if you google something like jquery chaining multiple next the solution will point to nextall . is there a methodology behind what was chosen to implement and is there a intention to add more?
