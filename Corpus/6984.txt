 URL : "https://github.com/mattschofield/fifadb/issues/1" TITLE : could be drier. BODY : there seems to be a lot of similar behaviour in the player attribute extraction methods https://github.com/mattschofield/fifadb/blob/master/main.go l186 , with a lot of them differing only by the attribute being extracted, could this be factored out? are you accepting prs?
