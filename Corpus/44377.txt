 URL : "https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-net/issues/542" TITLE : eta on async support? BODY : any eta on when the odata dependency will be removed and true asynchronous support will be added? this is already causing a lot of performance issues for many users, especially for those who need to do a lot of reads and writes to azure storage. i had to write my own azure storage table client in order to overcome the issue of all my threads waiting for synchronous operations that happen inside odata, but i'd rather use the sdk as soon as there's true asynchronous support. i would love to hear if there are any plans to do it by the end of this year. thanks.
