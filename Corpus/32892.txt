BODY : issue summary after upgrade to ghost 1.6.0, the is helper doesn't interpret the index context properly. steps to reproduce 1. update ghost to 1.6.0 2. reload the page up until 1.5.2, my theme worked well. the code in its entirety in a .hbs file looks like this: <link rel= stylesheet type= text/css {{ is index, tag }} href= {{asset 'css/index.css'}} {{/is}} {{ is post, page }} href= {{asset 'css/post.css'}} {{/is}} /> <link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=raleway:300' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'/> <link type= text/css rel= stylesheet href= {{asset 'css/fontello.css'}} /> <link type= text/css rel= stylesheet href= {{asset 'css/prism.css'}} /> relevant are these lines: {{ is index, tag }} href= {{asset 'css/index.css'}} {{/is}} according to spec https://themes.ghost.org/docs/is , index is true for the main post listing, including the home page . after update to 1.6.0, css on my home page no longer rendered. posts rendered fine, no change there. after examining the generated html, i found the href attribute remained empty. that made me think maybe the if expression didn't match anything. after i'd explicitly added home', the expression matched correctly. i.e. the fix looked like this: {{ is home, index, tag }} href= {{asset 'css/index.css'}} {{/is}} why i think it's a bug: according to the spec, it seems index should also cover home , and adding it explicitly should not be necessary. technical details: ghost version: 1.6.0 node version: 6.11.2 browser/os: irrelevant database: mysql irrelevant, presumably
