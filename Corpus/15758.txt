 URL : "https://github.com/Albluca/rpgraph/issues/6" TITLE : fix input points. BODY : dear luca, now i do have a question that i could not solve myself. is it possible to fix the endpoints from a given initialization topology so their coordinates are not changes along the energy minimization? i am asking this, because, i am able to approximate the endpoints correctly when then, they are pulled towards regions that are more internal in the branches of my trees. i think that is consistent with the idea of elastic trees, trying to fit the densities in the best way... but still, i would need to fix those coordinates to not be updated. any idea is welcome : best and thanks for your help. gonza
