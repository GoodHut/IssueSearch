 URL : "https://github.com/mpdf/mpdf/issues/328" TITLE : mpdf autoload doesn't load BODY : i upgraded my dev server to php 7.1, and mpdf 6 doesn't work any more. so i updated mpdf to the latest dev version as of 8 feb 2017 . now i get errors saying the mpdf class doesn't exist. i've confirmed that i am successfully including the autoload.php file, but it appears the code is not successfully doing whatever it needs to do to actually create the class.
