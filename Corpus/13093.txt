 URL : "https://github.com/SCIP-Interfaces/PySCIPOpt/issues/44" TITLE : support for socp BODY : hi, currently socp constraints such as x^2 + y^2 <= t^2 are treated as a non-convex quadratic constraint when passed to pyscipopt. would it be possible to develop an interface to scip's c-code of cons_soc.h ? then, i could implement socps' correctly in picos! thanks, guillaume.
