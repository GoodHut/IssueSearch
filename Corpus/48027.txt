 URL : "https://github.com/CrowsVeldt/FreeCodeCamp-Javascript-Calculator/issues/11" TITLE : refactor display code BODY : the display should obfuscate the details of what is going on behind the scenes and simply show the user what she/he needs to know. - all values should be displayed identically, whether they are stored as strings or arrays - maybe display equationtoevalute and currententry on the same line, or maybe follow closer to the freecodecamp example code and have equationtoevaluate stay seperate. honestly this is more of a stylistic issue. i'll see what seems best.
