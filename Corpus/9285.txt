 URL : "https://github.com/WesBunton/MyCertificates/issues/4" TITLE : update the tips BODY : there's an issue that i came across using the materialshowcaseview project. there is supposed to be a simple capability to show a sequence of tips, but the best that i could get it to work was to simply show all the tips at once, and you can see them bleeding through the opaque images on top of each other. there is an open issue currently on that project to address this. once that issue has been addressed, we should update the tips to be a bit more functional.
