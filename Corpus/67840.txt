 URL : "https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/397" TITLE : quest: type of crossing BODY : the basic idea is to look for nodes with highway=crossing and !crossing and ask the user to select what kind of crossing it is https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/key:crossing : crossing=traffic_signals crossing=uncontrolled crossing=island crossing=unmarked optionally we could also try to handle lack of possibility to cross the street, this would require removal of highway=crossing and adding crossing=no .
