 URL : "https://github.com/loowid/loowid/issues/204" TITLE : loowid crashing in chrome BODY : we're facing some strange behaviour here. we're testing loowid, and when using it with google chrome 56.0.2924.76, after leaving the loowid, trying to enter it again we got stuck in the 'loading' page. we're using also the google chrome screen sharing extension. firefox doesn't have this same behaviour. also, when opening a new anonymous window, we're able again to use loowid. thanks!
