 URL : "https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/issues/2270" TITLE : issues with ssl BODY : hi i have a subdomain pointing to the ip of jitsi and i have followed the quick install, it was giving me an error about invalid ssl, i tried a few things and uninstalled and reinstalled jitsi meet, the error still remains, and now i have issues opening the camera, i have to remove permissions and re add every time i came to the page, but now also the video screen has disappeared from the display. i think is because i originally added the hostname as the ip, but cannot find the location to change this, the errors in the domain seem to be pointing to the ip still, where do you modify the hostnames if you are using jetty? no apache or nginx installed. tia
