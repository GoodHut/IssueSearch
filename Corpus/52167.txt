 URL : "https://github.com/SamirTalwar/arborist/issues/1" TITLE : cannot test http calls BODY : hi, thanks for making arborist. it doesn't seem like we're able to test http calls with it though, although i assumed we could since task exposes: elm totask : request a -> task error a given: elm tests : list test tests = test foo! let a = t.succeed b = h.totask <| register host guy in assert a equals b we get the following when running the tests: /tmp/arborist-test-2620179935.js:8970 var xhr = new xmlhttprequest ; ^ referenceerror: xmlhttprequest is not defined at object.callback /tmp/arborist-test-2620179935.js:8970:17 at step /tmp/arborist-test-2620179935.js:1849:39 at timeout.work as _ontimeout /tmp/arborist-test-2620179935.js:1907:15 at ontimeout timers.js:380:14 at tryontimeout timers.js:244:5 at timer.listontimeout timers.js:214:5 looks like one of those runtime errors elm promises to never have ; thoughts? thanks.
