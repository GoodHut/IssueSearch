 URL : "https://github.com/invisible-college/statebus/issues/21" TITLE : proposal: state schema BODY : i feel like there's a lot of this in statebus code: conns = fetch '/connections' conns.all ||= when i fetch remote state, fetch immediately returns with {key: '/connections'} , and later i will rerender with the all array. it seems like you should be able to tell statebus the schema for a key. maybe something like this: bus.schema = '/connections': all: array '/connection': id: string, video: boolean, audio: boolean, side benefits: 1. this helps document the state available in statebus 2. statebus could verify that saves obeyed the types - when you connect to a bus via the web protocol, it could send you its schema. the schema should definitely be optional, and should only check types on state and keys within state that are defined in the schema.
