 URL : "https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/issues/5781" TITLE : upgrade to bazel 0.4.5 BODY : bazel 0.4.5 https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/tag/0.4.5 provides some useful stuff, especially the environ parameter to repository_rule , which resolves this todo in gurobi.bzl https://github.com/robotlocomotion/drake/blob/master/tools/gurobi.bzl l8 . i believe 5762 fixed our last 0.4.5 backwards-compatibility issue - i've been beta-testing 0.4.5 on linux for the past week with no problems, and @soonho-tri says it's working on mac too. so, let's upgrade the ci images, xenial script, and documentation.
