 URL : "https://github.com/Alex-D/Trumbowyg/issues/591" TITLE : delete uploaded image BODY : i can't seem to find what is triggered when the image has been deleted. is there anyway to know if the image is deleted? since i upload images to the server using upload plugin, i need to delete the unused images. is there anything like on 'image remove', function .... i have tried 'tbwchange', but it is triggered every time there're any changes. i tried to keep changes between previous texts and current texts and see if it's image tag. but there's a problem with keeping changes, undo, redo and performances. so is there anyway to know if the image is deleted?
