 URL : "https://github.com/RubaXa/Sortable/issues/1078" TITLE : disable on filter BODY : is there any way to disable the sortable within onfilter function? i'd like it to stop working when the user clicks on any of the filtered lists elements that are inside the sortable block. not much luck with any combination i tried, the sortable.option disabled , true ; does not work in this case. thanks in advance. sortable.create sortableelement, { //handle: '.draggable', // restricts sort start click/touch to the specified element filter: 'p, .text, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6', draggable: '.draggable', // specifies which items inside the element should be sortable onfilter: function / event /evt { //sortable.option disabled , true ; } } ;
