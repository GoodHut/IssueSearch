 URL : "https://github.com/ofek/hatch/issues/48" TITLE : integration with conda BODY : first, this project is awesome and i'm loving it so far. this is more of a feature request than an actual issue, but i was thinking it would be really cool if hatch could optionally integrate with conda. perhaps one could switch between conda mode and normal mode where hatch env , hatch install , etc. are just wrappers around the relevant conda commands. the main benefit from this is consolidation, instead of having to manually manage two sets of virtual environments ones generated by conda and ones generated by hatch , everything could just be managed through hatch. the second benefit is that install will pull from the conda repos instead of pypi repos, which tends to have nicely optimized data analysis packages. i did try just configuring hatch to put its virtual environments under ~/miniconda/envs, but conda didn't pick them up for some reason i think because conda expects some additional metadata and environment structure . in the future, it might also be really neat to integrate with anaconda project http://anaconda-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html . apparently the api isn't stable yet though : if this is a pain, or otherwise a silly request, feel free to say so. thanks!
