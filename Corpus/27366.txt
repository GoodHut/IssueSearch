 URL : "https://github.com/Artelnics/OpenNN/issues/31" TITLE : cross entropy error BODY : in cross_entropy_error.cpp, the outputs are calculated on multilayer_perceptron but not neural_network. so the loss function does not incorporate the probability layer and will introduce a log -ve situation. this problem occurs in all error classes. the evaluated loss functions do not include the probability layer, conditional layer etc.
