 URL : "https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/issues/2826" TITLE : fasten hashindex lookup BODY : the lookup code currently has to check whether it did a full table scan and is finished because of this. if we know that there are always free buckets in the table and not everything is filled up with tombstones or we do not have any tombstones at all , we can conclude that full table scans won't ever happen due to that it finds a free bucket first . so that check can be just removed if the precondition is always met.
