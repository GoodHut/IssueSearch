 URL : "https://github.com/NYTimes/collectd-rabbitmq/issues/55" TITLE : plugin hangs on startup BODY : using the latest version, i frequently find that the plugin simply hangs. my collectd config: <plugin python> logtraces true interactive false import collectd_rabbitmq.collectd_plugin <module collectd_rabbitmq.collectd_plugin > username guest password guest realm rabbitmq management host localhost port 15672 </module> </plugin> and the resulting log: 2017-03-31 16:40:50 plugin_load: plugin python successfully loaded. 2017-03-31 16:40:51 plugin_load: plugin write_log successfully loaded. 2017-03-31 16:40:52 initialization complete, entering read-loop. when i compiled collectd with debug enabled, it would log one additional line before hanging: 2017-03-30 20:22:03 getting info for http://localhost:15672/api/nodes a curl to that route returns successfully and very quickly! , yet the collectd plugin simply hangs. any ideas? i can get it to error say, put the wrong username in the config , but can't get it to repeatedly behave properly. it has worked a handful of times, but i can't consistently reproduce that.
