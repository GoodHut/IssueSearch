 URL : "https://github.com/iComics/iComics-Issues/issues/68" TITLE : text based formats BODY : i'm not 100% sold on this for a comic book app, but there may be cases where it may be useful. there's been requests for adding support for text based formats, including txt , md , and text-based epub . since the app currently assumes it only deals with image data, this would be a lot of extra effort to add. i'm not too adverse to adding it, but it needs a fair bit of justification as to why a comic book app should have it.
