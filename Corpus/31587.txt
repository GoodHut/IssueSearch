 URL : "https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui/issues/383" TITLE : ssh handshake issue BODY : hello, i'm getting a handshake failed: no matching key exchange algorithm error. i'm able to connect to another database through ssh and i can access the failing server through ssh on my terminal but not through sqlectron. i suspect this is because the server is using a newer key exchange algorithm that sqlelectron doesn't support. also, i tried looking in the debug to find out which key exchange algorithm is being used but i was unable to find it. cheers!
