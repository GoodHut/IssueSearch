 URL : "https://github.com/jonas/tig/issues/589" TITLE : clear last line upon exit BODY : if the last line contains any text at exit, it should be cleared first. for example i hit the up arrow on the head commit. tig displays _cannot move beyond the first line_. if a user exits at this point, the text will persist on their screen assuming their shell prompt is short enough. ! screen shot 2017-04-17 at 10 27 13 am https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6373201/25091773/cc791784-2358-11e7-8d8a-c5339ae9b269.png
