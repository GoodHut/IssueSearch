 URL : "https://github.com/lookout/summon-cerberus/issues/5" TITLE : client version http header BODY : cerberus client should self report their name and version via http header with all requests to cerberus. this is a feature request against all cerberus clients. this feature will be helpful in understanding: - what clients are being used in a particular cerberus environment - if a bug exists in a certain client version, is that client still being used by applications the format for this header is similar to the user-agent string. in fact, we considered using the user-agent header but thought using a custom header will make some reporting easier. specification: http header name: 'x-cerberus-client' example value: 'cerberusjavaclient/1.4.0'
