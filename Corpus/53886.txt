 URL : "https://github.com/AdeelK93/collapsibleTree/issues/17" TITLE : export to static plot? BODY : i've looked around a bit online for how one might do this for htmlwidgets in general, but i haven't had any luck. is there a straightforward way to export the current plot to a static image ideally a pdf or svg ? i'm using collapsibletree in a shiny app where users may heavily customize a tree colors, nodes appearing, etc. but then i want to afford them the ability to export the image to a static format. thanks!
