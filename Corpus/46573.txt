 URL : "https://github.com/d3/d3-force/issues/87" TITLE : minimal force example BODY : now this might just be an issue with the documentation, but when trying to create my own force. i ran into an issue that seems strange to me: ! image https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8543370/23065054/a28f07ae-f567-11e6-8587-04a732bfbc43.png if i provide a force function in my scope, why would i be able to see the nodes , variable, i tried this with a minimal example here http://codepen.io/anon/pen/kalweg?editors=0010 , and it behaved as i expected, if you check your console nodes is not defined. so perhaps we should update this documentation to include a simpler force, it remains unclear to me how a user would be able to iterate through the nodes in the force.
