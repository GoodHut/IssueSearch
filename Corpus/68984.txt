 URL : "https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4377" TITLE : speed up ssh completion BODY : a wish list entry as discussed in issue 4374: completion of ssh hostnames in fish 2.6 and current git master becomes slower when many host names are available in known_hosts and possibly ~/.ssh/config in my case: $ wc -l /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts ~/.ssh/known_hosts 314 /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts 470 /home/thomas/.ssh/known_hosts $ __fish_print_hostnames | wc -l 1510 $ __fish_print_hostnames | grep . | sort | uniq | wc -l 1282 most entries have one or more ips in addition to hostnames, some have multiple hostnames. some hosts are listed twice due to multiple public keys e.g. ssh-rsa and ssh-ed25519 . ~/.ssh/config has multiple entries some with multiple hostnames , too: $ grep '^host ' ~/.ssh/config|wc -l 140 $ grep '^host ' ~/.ssh/config|cut -d' ' -f2-|tr ' ' ' '|wc -l 233 timing is done with: time fish -c __fish_print_hostnames >/dev/null which yields 0.32s best of multiple runs on intel xeon cpu e5-2620 @ 2.10ghz and 0.51s on amd opteron 2352. for comparison: bash performs completion here without any noticeable delay.
