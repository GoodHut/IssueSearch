 URL : "https://github.com/dorukeker/gyronorm.js/issues/41" TITLE : error in readme 2.0.6, npm BODY : i installed 2.0.6 via npm. readme says: var gyronorm = require 'gyronorm' .gyronorm; this is actually undefined. what it should say is: var gyronorm = require 'gyronorm' ; tested with node 7.9.0 i don't know if this is a bug, because it is quite unusual to directly export the constructor
