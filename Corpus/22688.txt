 URL : "https://github.com/UofS-Pulse-Binfo/KnowPulse/issues/12" TITLE : markers on jbrowse BODY : we had a vague request from haiying today summarized : > when i blast something and then click on the hit takes her to jbrowse it would be nice to see all the wild information, as well as, medicago, soybean, etc. originally it seems like she wanted separate wild jbrowse instances that she could jump out to but the current state of these genomes doesn't fit well with that no chromosomes yet ;-p . after more discussion it seemed like she wanted wild gene models on culinaris jbrowse but again such a thing doesn't exist. what we have come up with to give her wild information on the culinaris jbrowse is to put the exome capture snps up on knowpulse with one track per lentil species.
