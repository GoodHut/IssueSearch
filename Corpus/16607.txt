 URL : "https://github.com/ucb-bar/rocket-chip/issues/653" TITLE : l2 cache missing? BODY : has l2 cache been removed from the rocket chip generator recently? originally i saw l2 cache implementation under /uncore/agent, but now it is gone. also, it seems that the code to instantiate l2 cache is missing i tried to trace versions to several months back, but didn't find a place in the code base to instantiate the l2hellacachebank . is it because i have some misunderstanding of the code? if i want to enable l2 cache in the latest repo, what should i do? thanks.
