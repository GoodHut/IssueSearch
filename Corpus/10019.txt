 URL : "https://github.com/tpope/vim-projectionist/issues/86" TITLE : adding a git tag BODY : i wanted to test integration with projectionist.vim in my vim plugin, and for that i'm using vim-flavor . however, when i added tpope/vim-projectionist to vimflavor and tried to install, it complained that there is no valid version. so it seems that vim-flavor refuses to install if the vim plugin project doesn't have any git tags to lock to, which projectionist.vim doesn't. would it be possible to add a git tag to the latest commit?
