 URL : "https://github.com/beancount/fava/issues/495" TITLE : error when building BODY : thanks for improving the makefile, but i am having a few issues: - rollup -c now throws an error when building the static ressources, see this log output: log.txt https://github.com/beancount/fava/files/749158/log.txt - also, i think the following command should be added to the makefile's clean target: rm -rf fava/static/gen otherwise make clean all does not execute npm run build . - and, more on a sidenote, binaries should be a phony target, right?
