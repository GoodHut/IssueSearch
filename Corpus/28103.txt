question 12 activecode: 7 ex_5_7 gives the following error error syntaxerror: bad input on line 9 description this message indicates that python can't figure out the syntax of a particular statement. some examples are assigning to a literal, or a function call to fix check your assignment statments and make sure that the left hand side of the assignment is a variable, not a literal or a function. however if i copy and paste my code into one of the extra activecode boxes at the end of another chapter the code works fine. so i would guess its just a problem with this box.
