 URL : "https://github.com/thomasjbradley/markbot/issues/113" TITLE : redesign start screen BODY : i’ve become really negative towards the light purple start screen. i’m thinking more of a light translucent style like on patternbot & spritebot. maybe markbot and the other two should have their icon in the start screen to help distinguish?
