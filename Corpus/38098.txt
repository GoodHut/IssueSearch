 URL : "https://github.com/roo-rb/roo/issues/375" TITLE : non-square csv fails BODY : after upgrading to 2.7.0, a service we've been using stopped working: we are opening a csv file generated by a third party, the first line contains meta-data, second line is headers, and third onward is the data itself. because the meta-data width is shorter than the data and roo is assuming the column_count according to first line, none of the data that is past these columns are accessible, making the service unusable.
