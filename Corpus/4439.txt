 URL : "https://github.com/BiglySoftware/BiglyBT/issues/138" TITLE : cpu usage high BODY : i noticed bigly uses a lot of cpu when the plugin/network i2p is enabled. the process takes around 4-8 % of cpu and i have an i7 7700k! when it is enabled, compared to 0-3 % when it's not. it wouldn't matter if i wouldn't notice the impact on the os. everything gets noticeable slower. in addition, ehen i2p is working, sometimes my system even freezes for some seconds... this has been like this for a long time. back then, when i noticed the issues i2p creates, i disabled it. yesterday i reenabled it to see if it was perfected, better optimized. it behaves all the same. bigly also takes a lot more time to close when i2p is enabled. it can even cause to close incorrectly if one shuts down the os right when the gui closes... windows 7 ultimate x64 sp1. biglybt 1.2.0.0.
