 URL : "https://github.com/neo-project/neo-gui/issues/113" TITLE : neo-gui extremely slow BODY : hi, i use windows 10 and the latest version of neo-gui. previously i was using antshares client and it worked fine. in october, i downloaded neo-gui, and i think it should be the current edition. i copied the .db3 file from the antshares repository into the neo-gui repository and it worked. however, the problem is that the synchronization speed is extremely slow. i think it is perhaps less than 10% of that of antshares client, and it can never truly keep up with the whole network, no matter how long it stays connected. i didn't remember downloading https://github.com/neo-project/leveldb url , and i don't know how to build it on windows 10. is it a possible source of the problem? any help is greatly appreciated. thank you very much!
