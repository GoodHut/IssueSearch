 URL : "https://github.com/michaelwayman/node-sass-chokidar/issues/28" TITLE : heroku not compiled BODY : this might be related to node-sass itself, but i don't know for sure. i simply cannot build the project for heroku. of course, i don't necessarily need the sass compiler on the server, i can simply push the css and ignore the scss , but it's quite annoying to go to package.json everytime to remove the devdependency and the others. error: cannot find module 'set-blocking' remote: npm err! errno 1 remote: npm err! node-sass@4.6.1 install: node scripts/install.js
