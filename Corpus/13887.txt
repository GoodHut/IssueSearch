 URL : "https://github.com/McSwaggens/AimTux/issues/571" TITLE : 3d footsteps size BODY : is it possible to make the 3d footsteps waves smaller ? i find the waves size unpleasant. also, if there was a way to only add like small dots instead of circles like unity does,it would make it a lot better. i use this instead of esp since its more legit and i think it deserves more attention.
