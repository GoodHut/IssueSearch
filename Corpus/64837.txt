BODY : description <!-- --> i started using catch yesterday to build my unit testing cases. good thing about catch is that, setup was so easy, i could setup everything in 5 minutes and started writing testcases!! coming to my issue. my application runs in some loop and the normal way of exiting it is by ctrl+c / sigabrt. but when this happens catch says it failed. is there any way to make normal exit when sigabrt is received ? i tried handling sigabrt by calling exit 0 in the handler, but still the testcase fails. can you please suggest me how to proceed ? i tried finding others posts regarding this, but none of them helped. please advice
