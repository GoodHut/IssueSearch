 URL : "https://github.com/UnifiedEngineering/T-962-improvements/issues/105" TITLE : gain and offsets BODY : hi, i just upgraded my t962 to use 4 max30850's, do the gain and offsets in software not work? i'm currently only using 2 thermocouples l & r . the right had thermocouple seems to be 30 degrees higher than the left. no matter what adjustments i make in software it doesn't make any difference. i've replaced both thermocouples and both lamps for these http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/heat-lamps/7393536/ . how can i calibrate the thermocouples? i'm running firmware 0.5.1 by the way. cheers charlie
