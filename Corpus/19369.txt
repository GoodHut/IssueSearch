 URL : "https://github.com/Azure/azure-mobile-apps-net-client/issues/346" TITLE : add / remove files BODY : in previous versions of the mobile sdk, you could add and remove files etc. the url for the files no longer works https://github.com/azure/azure-mobile-apps-net-files-client, and i cannot see anything in the current code base to deal with files /blobs etc. is it the case the url is broken, or has the functionality been removed from the sdk
