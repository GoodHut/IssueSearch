 URL : "https://github.com/JOSM/Mapillary/issues/62" TITLE : build problems on windows BODY : today i tested, how well building this project on windows works. and i realized, that there are multiple problems preventing the build from passing. first i had problems with the character encoding of the source code, the :compilejava task failed. but even after setting the encoding for the compile tasks fix not yet pushed to github , there were multiple unit tests failing. part of them also because of encoding issues. for example because of the umlaut Ã¤ in this line somehow i knew, when adding that line, that someday this character will point me at an encoding issue :wink: : https://github.com/josm/mapillary/blob/2d97ef44352a628fdf006e2ff905c20aec5e17cc/test/unit/org/openstreetmap/josm/plugins/mapillary/utils/api/jsonuserprofiledecodertest.java l73 other tests were failing, because a lockfile of the jcs cache existed, so the test could not read/write to/from the cache. if there is somebody using windows, who could help investigate the issue and test out new versions that try to fix this, it would be great if you could give it a try: batchfile git clone https://github.com/josm/mapillary.git gradlew build
