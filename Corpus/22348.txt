 URL : "https://github.com/emcrisostomo/fswatch/issues/194" TITLE : json format output BODY : it would be nice to have that in fswatch tool itself, but it have very limited use cases. basically idea is to have something like this: zsh $ fswatch -json . { path : foo/bar , timestamp : 1233543, flags : isfile , modified }, { path : foo/bar1 , timestamp : 1233553, flags : isfile , modified }, { path : foo/bar2 , timestamp : 1233563, flags : isfile , modified }, { path : foo/bar3 , timestamp : 1233573, flags : isfile , modified }, ... that would allow to stream/log events in effortlessly-machine-readible format. is it worth implementing? any ideas?
