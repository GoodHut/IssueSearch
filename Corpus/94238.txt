 URL : "https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/2899" TITLE : bugs wiimote class - macos BODY : <b>i should make clear that:</b> - _wiimote class is stable in terms of syncing and communication within linux_ - _the same doesn't happen in macos_ among recurrent bugs in wiimote class are the facts that: - _it doesn't sync properly_ sometimes it doesn't simply sync - _it doesn't communicate properly within the server_ faulty/jittery communication, sometimes stops responding even though stating that it's not necessarely a priority to fix this, i think: - _we should add it to the list of things to fix in supercollider on the mid-long run_ low priority ._ please feel free to drop your comments on my statement. looking forward to hear from you kind regards t.
