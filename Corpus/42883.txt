 URL : "https://github.com/nerds-and-company/schematic/issues/78" TITLE : cannot rename handles BODY : one limitation of this plugin i'm running up against is the inability to rename handles. it's not uncommon for a field or section name to change as a project progresses, and the use of the handle as an identifier in schema.yml makes it difficult to do this. as far as i can tell the only way around it is to rename the field in the database prior to import, which is hairy as the templates will reference the wrong handle in the interim. is there any reason you're not using ids instead of handles to query existing elements?
