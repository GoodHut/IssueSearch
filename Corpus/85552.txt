 URL : "https://github.com/gahansen/Albany/issues/82" TITLE : felix failing comparisons BODY : beginning 3/14/17, felix tests in irina's nightly builds began failing due to failed comparisons: http://cdash.sandia.gov/cdash-2-3-0/viewtest.php?onlyfailed&buildid=49805 i believe this has to do with dan's push to albany to correct the problem that regression comparisons were not being made.
