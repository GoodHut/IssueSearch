 URL : "https://github.com/pixlsus/raw/issues/73" TITLE : zz ugly stuff. BODY : a tldr after irc disscussions: - a new boolean field is needed for the images: selected - if the field is set, - image can not be deleted, - and the field can not be unset. thus, it makes such an image permanent . - all the images with this field set should be additionally exposed in https://raw.pixls.us/data-unique/ - this boolean field should probably not be settable by all the registered users, but an additional whitelist should be present.
