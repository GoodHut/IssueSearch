 URL : "https://github.com/bondjimbond/islandora_downloadable_datastreams/issues/4" TITLE : tighten cmodel list BODY : currently fetches the complete list of islandora cmodels as options for the config form. but the module presently only works with five of those cmodels. list needs to be tightened to just the cmodels that actually apply. first need to decide whether any other cmodels actually need a download block.
