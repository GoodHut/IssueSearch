 URL : "https://github.com/openshift/origin/issues/12549" TITLE : build durations are wrong BODY : the build.status.duration field is reporting incorrect values, the values are much too small. it appears the decorator being used to set the value is called immediately after the build is created, whereas it should only be called when the build completes. i'm not even sure why we're using a decorator to set this value instead of setting when we update the build status to complete. https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/pkg/build/registry/build/strategy.go l27 near as i can tell, that code will result in the duration being set to currenttime-creationtime, the first time the decorator is invoked which is when exactly? but certainly it's not when the build is complete . i'm also not really sure why we even have a duration field, we should just be calculating it based on the status.starttime and status.completiontime, anytime we need to display it. @smarterclayton @csrwng any chance you know some of the history behind why we're doing this this way?
