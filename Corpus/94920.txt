 URL : "https://github.com/Boomaga/boomaga/issues/52" TITLE : compatibility with poppler BODY : yesterday received poppler 0.41.0-0ubuntu 1.2 . printing to boomaga results in no graphical display of printed document and empty page when printed on printer. boomaga used was 0.91. operating system mint 18.1 and mint 18.2 cinnamon. version 0.41.0-0ubuntu 1.1 works. backup was a good idea after all : however it cannot stay like this. the new version of poppler seems to be offered for update very strongly...
