 URL : "https://github.com/jmorrow0/deuPD/issues/2" TITLE : add license information BODY : hi, your project seems useful, but it doesn't contain a license, neither as a copying.txt nor in the python files or german.dic. the deupd.txt file has a bsd header, but that's not sufficient to be sure about the rest of the project. it would be helpful for potential users to have these two bits of information added: - a license for your code i presume it's all yours? , - a note where the original dictionaries german.dic, raw_spanish.txt came from and their original licenses, which is important in case a license propagates into derived works. thanks!
