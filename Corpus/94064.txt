BODY : hi folks! i'm a data engineer at spotify. we use bigquery extensively hundreds of users . we also have tons of pandas users. being able to talk to bigquery via a dataframe abstraction from within a jupyter notebook would be really powerful. i may get some cycles to hack on a bigquery backend for ibis later this fall. i'm curious and interested in ibis but have little experience using it and zero understanding of the internals. very much at the stage where i'm exploring the possibility and trying to grasp what would be involved. i have a few basic questions: - what's the current state of ibis development and adoption? releases slowed last year but seem to have picked up recently. just want to make sure there's still momentum before jumping in. - what would be involved in writing a bigquery backend? what are the major steps? hard bits? let's assume we would only support standard sql to make things easier. legacy sql is on the way out. - how big of an undertaking is it? 1-2 months for a single developer? 6-9 months? - not sure how bigquery compares to impala, but it does have certain quirks. any thoughts on how to handle possibly bq-specific things like: nested records, repeating records, javascript udfs, approximate aggregation functions and bq-specific functions more generally ? looking forward to learning more!
