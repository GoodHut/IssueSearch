 URL : "https://github.com/vincentmorneau/apex-publish-static-files/issues/2" TITLE : command line runner BODY : might be a nice addition to supply a runnable command for the command line. i created a fork earlier on to give this a go https://github.com/tschf/apex-publish-static-files/tree/add-bin . i took example from another project http-server , so that when i install globally , it creates as link as per: npm install -g /home/trent/.npm_modules/bin/afpub -> /home/trent/.npm_modules/lib/node_modules/apex-publish-static-files/bin/apex-publish-static-files then gives me a runnable program: trent@birroth:~/projects/apex-publish-static-files$ type -a afpub afpub is /home/trent/.npm_modules/bin/afpub the only thing i'm unsure of, is how this behaves on windows, as the script and the project i copied from seems more designed for unix systems i called the exe afpub just so the name isn't so long. anyway, i didn't log a pr incase you didn't want to add an exe; or so you can take my example to introduce your own implementation. p.s. you're always coming out with some nice projects - this one included. :+1:
