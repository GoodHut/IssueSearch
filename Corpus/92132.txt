 URL : "https://github.com/getgauge/gauge/issues/800" TITLE : vendor gauge dependencies BODY : gauge uses godep to manage dependencies, this locks down a particular version of the dependency needed by gauge. this forces godep restore to be executed for gauge to be built. this command does not work well with if gauge has to be installed with go get . to remove this dependency on gauge, use go vendor support instead.
