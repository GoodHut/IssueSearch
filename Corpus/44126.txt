 URL : "https://github.com/mancj/MaterialSearchBar/issues/35" TITLE : edittext cursor color BODY : currently the cursor for the edittext box for me is defaulting to white due to our apps theme but i want to set the color of the cursor in the search bar specifically so it can actually appear clearly over its white background. any chance of getting access to the textcursordrawable method or something similar to the hint and text color methods?
