 URL : "https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux2/issues/516" TITLE : document builder utilities BODY : i got a question from trevor foley about documentation for skyauthhttp, which bobby said is a file that helps securely pass a user logged in to bbauth’s token when making calls to a spa’s backend. when i asked if there was anything important about it to document for developers, he said yes and suggested creating a builder utilities section in the docs. so creating this issue as a reminder to create this new section.
