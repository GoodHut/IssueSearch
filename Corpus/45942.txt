 URL : "https://github.com/AngelArenaAllstars/suggestions/issues/106" TITLE : item idea, aquila 2.0 BODY : build up =3 rings of aquila, gives you some solid stats as well as an aura idk numbers for balance that well so someone help me out plz. active ability: summons hawk- summons hawk just like beastmaster so you have a mobile ward that you dont have to go into enemy territory to place, bird lasts certain duration, 2 charges. certain cooldown, certain bounty. i figured it would be a decent support item as it would give good stats, an aura for your team, make stacking aquilas more viable and interesting, and be an alternative to warding once again i have no clue as to what numbers would be balanced.
