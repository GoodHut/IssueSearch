 URL : "https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/issues/51" TITLE : add missing source models BODY : currently we have some gltf 2.0 models that have been graciously contributed that unfortunately we don't have source models for. this makes it hard to maintain this repo in general since these models have to be updated by hand when the schema changes, along with generation of the model variants. adding these will also help me find and correct any issues with collada2gltf-2.0's pbr generation. if you've contributed a gltf 2.0 model without a source model, i would really appreciate it if possible if you could open a pr contributing the source model as well, preferably in collada format into the sourcemodels directory. the following don't have source models: advancedmaterial animatedcube animatedtriangle boombox cameras corset cube lantern metalroughspheres normaltangenttest scifihelmet simplematerial simplemeshes simpleopacity simpleskin simpletexture suzanne triangle trianglewithoutindices twosidedplane again, thank you all for everything you're doing to help push gltf 2.0 along. @pjcozzi @emackey @javagl @bghgary @mcnopper
