 URL : "https://github.com/cristijora/vue-form-wizard/issues/101" TITLE : re start wizard BODY : is there anyway to reset the wizard to its initial state? i mean, how can we mark all those steps already visited as not visited again? lets suppose we have a wizard with 4 steps, and when we are in the second, then we would like to reset the wizard pressing an start over again button. thanks in advance.
