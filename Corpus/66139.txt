 URL : "https://github.com/zalun/FakeTransplant/issues/2" TITLE : many caches are running BODY : the requested id is not consintently incrementing. an example might look like 1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 2. then in send_pingback the are two separate reports if reloaded the page , one with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and the other with just 1, 2. i haven't been checking if there is more than 2 pools. this is possibly the result of running simplecache with wsgi.
