 URL : "https://github.com/baldurk/renderdoc/issues/750" TITLE : shared library versioning BODY : hi, i am trying to get the rpm https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/gicmo/devel/package/renderdoc/ into the actual fedora repositories, but in fedora every shared library needs to be properly versioned for proper abi changes handling , see the section in the packaging guidelines https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/packaging:guidelines downstream_.so_name_versioning . currently librenderdoc.so is unversioned though and thus poses a problem. it would be great to avoid downstream versioning and just properly version the library upstream.
