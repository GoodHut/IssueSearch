 URL : "https://github.com/lexmag/fluxter/issues/16" TITLE : dynamic host/port config BODY : currently, start_link/0 calls fluxster.config_for/1 . this seems to prevent runtime configuration of parameters. here are a few ways to improve this: - add @defoverridable start_link: 0 - make fluxster.config_for the default value for a new config_fun variable. - have config_for read from system.get_env before application.get_all_env . - move config_for into __using__ and make it overridable, and call it on the module rather than on fluxter.
