 URL : "https://github.com/agilie/AGCircularPicker/issues/6" TITLE : start at specific value BODY : hi. i have the picker working great with decimals by just diving the end value by 10 as you suggested. when i return to the picker i would like to set the control to the last used value. i initialize it starting at zero and going to 100 for example but would like it to be selected at an interim value, say 40 ie: remembers the last value since each time the picker is used it is to adjust the previous recorded value. is this possible?
