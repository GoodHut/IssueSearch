 URL : "https://github.com/r-lib/styler/issues/272" TITLE : fix continuous integration BODY : not all tic steps work anymore, because some tests that use a temp dir don't work after rcmdcheck ran successfully. https://travis-ci.org/r-lib/styler/jobs/296269960 l1780 @krlmlr any ideas why? also, coverage reports are not longer generated as the ci does not work and the repo is moved. @krlmlr how to fix that now styler is under r-lib once we solved the first issue ?
