 URL : "https://github.com/jnr/jnr-unixsocket/issues/42" TITLE : infinite nio selection BODY : i tried example server on ubuntu 14.04 release env and macos develop env . on mac, nio selection is wait for asleep until message received. https://github.com/jnr/jnr-unixsocket/blob/master/src/test/java/jnr/unixsocket/example/unixserver.java l47 but on ubuntu, nio selection is not blocked and loop infinitely. https://github.com/jnr/jnr-unixsocket/blob/master/src/test/java/jnr/unixsocket/example/unixserver.java l47-l67 in my guess, is the reason that ubuntu is not bsd? https://github.com/jnr/jnr-enxio/blob/master/src/main/java/jnr/enxio/channels/nativeselectorprovider.java l55-l57 please check whether i did mis-configured or not. thanks.
