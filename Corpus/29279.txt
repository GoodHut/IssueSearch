 URL : "https://github.com/razorpay/slack/issues/8" TITLE : laravel 5.4 support BODY : hi, looks like this fork seems the most updated. i'm looking for an updated repo to fix the 5.4 application::share break. i see the pr https://github.com/razorpay/slack/pull/2 has it in there, with a lot of other changes. since it looks like a small change just for 5.4 support, can this be updated separately soon?
