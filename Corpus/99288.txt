 URL : "https://github.com/elastic/logstash/issues/7125" TITLE : meta upgrading to jruby 9k BODY : with the release of logstash 6.0 just around the corner we want to take the opportunity to upgrade to jruby 9k, since 1.7 is eol and a lot of gems are now breaking under 1.7 because they explicitely require jruby 9k in their gemspec. todo - update logstash to be able to run under jruby 9k https://github.com/elastic/logstash/issues/5606 https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/6713 - create a feature branch with the jruby 9k - update plugins .travis.yaml to build with jruby 9k cc @guyboertje
