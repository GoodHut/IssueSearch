 URL : "https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/issues/1907" TITLE : bad cleanup/pruning logic BODY : if a deploy fails task in a hook throws an error , the whole deploy process stops & a bad release folder is left on the server. after a subsequent deploy of a good release, the old releases are considered for pruning. capistrano seems to actually delete the oldest good release & keeps your 2nd to latest bad release. its blindly deleting the oldest release & keeping the newer releases folders, even though the newer ones could just be leftover cruft from a failed deploy.
