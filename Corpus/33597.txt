 URL : "https://github.com/automicus/PyISY/issues/33" TITLE : adding event support BODY : hi there! i am working on a project for https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant to add support for receiving events from an isy. right now we use pyisy for all node updates, and it works very well for seeing and controlling the status of lights, but it cannot be away of when, for example, a human presses off on a lightswitch that was already off more importantly, i want to be able to see when the user does unusual things like double-tapping a switch. the events do pass through the isy and in to pyisy, but pyisy doesn't process the event because it only cares about status updates currently. so, what i would like to see is the ability for the consumer of this app to be able to subscribe to control events as isy calls them in addition to the status events that are already supported. i would be up for adding this myself, but i am not actually sure what direction to go in this implementation!
