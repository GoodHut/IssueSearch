 URL : "https://github.com/biemond/biemond-wildfly/issues/184" TITLE : rhel yum group BODY : i am attempting to use the eap7 packages through the yum repo from red hat. i'm having a problem getting a few items working. - if i set manage_user to false as the jboss user and group are installed with the packages, i get a catalog error on the $wildfly::dirname resource as it requires the user even though the if statement is in the same prepare class. with this, i do not see how a successful run may be accomplished with manage_user set to false. - the yum group is jboss-eap7. i do not believe the package resource understands a yum group. therefore, i was going to complete the install as an exec in the profile. from the docs, it looks like i will only be able to use the resource, cli, deployment, and restart types. is this list complete as it looks like i would lose the majority of the module features?
