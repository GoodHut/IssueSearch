 URL : "https://github.com/doctrine/annotations/issues/116" TITLE : use semantic versioning BODY : version 1.3.0 bumped the minimum php version to 5.6, which is a bc-break right? . this should have resulted in a major version change. it's annoying to do a composer install on the server and see problem 1 - installation request for doctrine/annotations v1.3.1 -> satisfiable by doctrine/annotations v1.3.1 . - doctrine/annotations v1.3.1 requires php ^5.6 || ^7.0 -> your php version 5.5.9 does not satisfy that requirement.
