 URL : "https://github.com/blchinezu/pocketbook-coolreader/issues/228" TITLE : css with display:none BODY : hello, i'm changing my ebooks and setting some parts with style that have set display:none. however i've noticed that such elements are still displayed in cool reader when i disable document internal styles. i'm disabling styles because i don't like each book different font, font size, font family. however i still would like to have hidden things hidden. so is there any way to have my own font but other styles persisted?
