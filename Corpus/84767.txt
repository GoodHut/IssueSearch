 URL : "https://github.com/vinaygoel/ars-workshop/issues/7" TITLE : docker image improvements BODY : i was going through the readme and i am glad that you have moved it to a docker based exercise. however, i feel like there is still too much work off-loaded to the user that can be automated to save time and ease the learning curve assuming that the participants are not always programmers or system admins . here are a few things that i think we should consider changing. create a base image with the common libraries and binaries included with appropriate volumes and environment variables defined in the dockerfile and necessary ports exposed create separate derived images from the base image for independent tasks and samples/exercises include necessary data and indexes in the image to make it ready to run use sensible default entrypoints and default commands for each derivative image allow overwriting volumes with fresh data provide bootstrap scripts that can be run as part of the initialization of the container there are many other things that can be done, but these alone will make the exercises so much easier to follow without the unnecessary command jargon.
