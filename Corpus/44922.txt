 URL : "https://github.com/BlueQuartzSoftware/DREAM3D/issues/627" TITLE : generate string array BODY : strings are becoming used/required in different filters e.g phasename and, depending on the pipeline, they might not be defined. therefore, it would be very useful to allow the user to create string arrays. this could be either as an added feature in the filter create data array or as a new filter.
