 URL : "https://github.com/JuliaStats/HypothesisTests.jl/issues/121" TITLE : tests for regressionmodel BODY : i wanted to know if this package would be a good place to develop a suite of tests for regression models or if it should be a different one. the idea would be to provide a few tests such as: struct waldtest <: regressiontests value::float64 dist::fdist function waldtest model::statsbase.regressionmodel; restrictions::union{matrix,vector{symbol}} = coefnames model ... end these tests would make use of the methods provided by statsbase as much as possible. a few that might be implemented are: hypothesis tests wald test https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wald_test lagrange multiplier test lm test https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/score_test likelihood ratio test lr test https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/likelihood-ratio_test sargan hansen test https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sargan%e2%80%93hansen_test durbin wu hausman test https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/durbin%e2%80%93wu%e2%80%93hausman_test chow test https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chow_test
