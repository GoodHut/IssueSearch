 URL : "https://github.com/vmware/harbor/issues/3460" TITLE : notary repo moving BODY : hi. notary has been accepted in to cncf and will be moving from its current location to github.com/theupdateframework/notary . as a downstream consumer you may want to update any references to use the new location. i'm aiming to complete the move in the next 48 hours including updating all the internal imports. a redirect will be in place and you appear to have pinned to a specific commit for your go vendoring. however i noticed in this https://github.com/vmware/harbor/blob/ddaad98526dbd708ee95d09a04ea0a4f278985a1/make/photon/notary/builder_public l38 location you appear to be cloning the head of master before building the server and signer binaries, which is likely to break after the move due to the internal imports changing from github.com/docker/notary/... to github.com/theupdateframework/notary/...
