 URL : "https://github.com/tim-evans/ember-file-upload/issues/53" TITLE : how to include credentials BODY : thanks tim for your great contribution! in my initial testing app, it's using the ember-simple-auth addon and basic auth. i haven't been able to figure out how to send the user credentials when calling the file.upload method. i believe that i need to set the xhrfields ajax property to {withcredentials: true}. tried setting it via the headers as well as data property but no luck. this was my last attempt: let response = file.uploadbinary config.app.api_host + '/file/upload/', { method: 'post', headers: {'content-type': 'application/octet-stream', 'x-csrf-token': csrf_token}, data: {'xhrfields': {withcredentials: true}}, } ;
