BODY : hi @narendraj9, thanks for this add-on. we have been gathering add-ons lately, at http://hledger.org/download.html d and http://hledger.org/hledger.html add-on-commands and it would be nice to link yours. would you like to update it for current stackage/ghc, and add setup instructions to the readme ? i saw your demo nice bear! : but adding transactions seemed to have no effect. it seems like your web service might be similar to hledger-api http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hledger-api ?
