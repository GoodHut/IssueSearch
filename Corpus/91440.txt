BODY : hello, i am trying to render a linechart tooltip elsewhere on my page. it seems the tooltip function would be the way to do this? from the api: if set a react element, the option is the custom react element of rendering tooltip. if set a function, the function will be called to render tooltip content. i have been unable to access the content of the data returned directly. i am trying this: <tooltip content={ this.showtooltipdata.bind this } /> <...> showtooltipdata = data => { console.log data ; // console.log data.payload 0 .color ; } the attempt above to access the color object as above just returns an undefined error, though i can see it in the console log. can anyone tell me the secret syntax sauce to get at this data? thanks! ! image https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14285373/24172771/da6da246-0e5f-11e7-9a1e-7e83182d3d02.png
