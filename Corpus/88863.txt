 URL : "https://github.com/Exerro/amend/issues/6" TITLE : packages and file imports BODY : a package, here, is a group of related files built together. packages are built in their own environment. a build should be able to handle multiple files, easily. it should also handle being able to load external dependencies, including other packages and files both at compile-time and runtime. to speed up compilation, external packages should be able to be compiled into some ir and loaded later through an import command. a native plugin should expose the include and import directives, include including a file once by default , and import including a package pre-compiled or not .
