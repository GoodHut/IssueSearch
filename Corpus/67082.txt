 URL : "https://github.com/riboseinc/rnp/issues/440" TITLE : optimize cfb mode usage BODY : description current cfb mode implementation processes input data by byte, which is quite slow. it should be optimized to work at least on per-word level. other optimization would be to process the whole chunk on botan level so botan_encrypt_block call overhead is not applied for each 8-16 bytes.
