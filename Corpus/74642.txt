 URL : "https://github.com/dougmoscrop/serverless-plugin-include-dependencies/issues/3" TITLE : fails with babel-runtime BODY : hi, i use serverless-plugin-include-dependencies in conjunction with a babel project. so i include babel-polyfill which requires babel-runtime . the plugin fails at packaging with this error: error: cannot find module 'babel-runtime' from '...project/node_modules/ba bel-polyfill' at function.module.exports as sync ...project/node_modules/resolve/ lib/sync.js:36:11 at object.keys.foreach.dependency ...project/node_modules/serverless- plugin-include-dependencies/get-dependency-list.js:60:29 .... i think the problem is that babel-runtime is not resolvable via resolve because of no main property. so this line https://github.com/dougmoscrop/serverless-plugin-include-dependencies/blob/master/get-dependency-list.js l59 will raise the error above. whats the correct behavior? thank you!
