 URL : "https://github.com/ataranlen/civcraft/issues/109" TITLE : player message... thing BODY : i am unable to check my code because i am at disney world, but i noticed some messages aren't sent to players through minechat. i think it only counts for players and not residents, since i receive some but not civ or town messages. if anyone is unable to find a fix, i can check when i get off vacation.
