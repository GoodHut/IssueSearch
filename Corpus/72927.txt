 URL : "https://github.com/garysieling/solrkit/issues/84" TITLE : class for saved searches BODY : i want to be able to create a series of saved searches, similar to how netflix works. these could be: 1. a preset playlist list of ids which retains order 2. a regular query, may need some ordering concept 3. a query with a bunch of facets pre-checked requirements: 1. when one of these is configured, it can be bound to some ui controls 2. when the ui controls are used e.g. faceting they can append to the saved search not modify the original so you can revert to the original 3. these should be serializable 4. there may need to be some ui control to 'revert' to the original
