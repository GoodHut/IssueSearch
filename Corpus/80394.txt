 URL : "https://github.com/udacity/sdc-issue-reports/issues/612" TITLE : traffic sign project bug BODY : towards the end of the jupyter notebook, in the activation visualization section, in function outputfeaturemap, first line in the for loop: plt.subplot 6,8,featuremap+1 . this breaks if the feature map has size larger than 48. i think changing the first one to ceil featuremaps/8 would be a reasonable alternative.
