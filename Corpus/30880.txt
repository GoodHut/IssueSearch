 URL : "https://github.com/valueflows/valueflows/issues/243" TITLE : relaunch of the cta BODY : the following is from oli sb over in the open apps ecosystem loomio discussion, here: https://www.loomio.org/d/6apmm0qh/comment/1526250. what do you all think about putting vf on the project list, http://collaborative.tech/projects? and there is a pledge too. i'm not fond of pledges in general, but i suppose that is part of it: http://collaborative.tech/joining-cta. after much debate and discussions with various members of the original cta crew i have tentatively produced the new cta website as promised. you can find it at http://collaborative.tech/ but although it is on the public web we are still not publicly promoting it as it needs more founding members before it can stand on its own feet... so please don't go shouting about it in public yet, but feel free to have a look at what we've done and to take the pledge, if you like... it would be great to have some of the projects of people in this thread listed. : all the best oli please discuss here as needed, we'd like to have some form of consensus, of course. if we don't hear back in a couple weeks, we'll assume it is ok!
