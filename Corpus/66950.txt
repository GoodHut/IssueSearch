 URL : "https://github.com/FezVrasta/bootstrap-material-design/issues/1200" TITLE : npm missing the v4 tags BODY : summary i can't install bootstrap-material-design@4.0.2 from npm . any plan on releasing it on npm , or do i miss something? expected result i run npm i --save bootstrap-material-design@4.0.2 and it works. additional information i know it's because the tag doesn't seems to be available on npm anymore. but the v4 documentation http://rosskevin.github.io/bootstrap-material-design/getting-started/download/ mention it already. also, bower has the version 4.0.2 https://libraries.io/bower/bootstrap-material-design/v4.0.2 here is the current error message npm err! notarget no compatible version found: bootstrap-material-design@4.0.2 npm err! notarget valid install targets: npm err! notarget 0.5.10, 0.5.9, 0.5.8, 0.5.7, 0.3.0 thanks :pray:
