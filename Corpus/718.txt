 URL : "https://github.com/cake-build/bakery/issues/67" TITLE : how to use BODY : i've been following this repository for over a month now but i'm not totally sure what it's supposed to do. seems to me to have something to do with intellisense for case scripts but i'm not sure. any plans on adding a section on how to use in the readme?
