 URL : "https://github.com/inkooboo/thread-pool-cpp/issues/14" TITLE : thread start/end lambdas BODY : i have a use-case where i need to invoke code on each of the worker threads on thread creation and shutdown. i have already written the code in my fork and would like to pr it here if you want the feature. the use case is for running mozilla's spidermonkey javascript engine in the thread pool. spidermonkey uses tls so the engine must run on the thread that created it. the new signature for threadfunc looks like: c++ inline void worker::threadfunc size_t id, worker steal_donor, onstart onstart, onstop onstop in addition each handler takes the thread 'id' as the first param, this allows the handler to locate the correct engine, eg: c++ void myhandler size_t id { auto& engine = engines id ; engine.evaluate function { return 42; } ; // run some js } my change is based on an old commit on your master. i've raised this as an issue now since it will take me some time to merge it and i'd rather not bother if you don't want it.
