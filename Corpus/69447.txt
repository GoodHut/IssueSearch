BODY : most other systems, have a way where you can select the customer and input the termination code and it will show the rates in order of how the system will attempt the call to a carrier/trunk based on the termination cost. since the logic is already in the billing, i am not sure how hard this would be to implement. this utility/screen/daignostic would be so much better than running a query on the database itsself.
