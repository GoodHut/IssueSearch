 URL : "https://github.com/wolfcw/libfaketime/issues/105" TITLE : vlc playback broken linux BODY : vlc shows a christmas icon during christmas and new year. i thought it would be cool to use faketime to trick it into using the icon all the time. so i tried the following: faketime -f @2016-12-25 $ date +%h:%m:%s vlc the icon is indeed set correctly, but videos will not play they freeze at the beginning . worked around the issue with the very useful option faketime_stop_after_seconds: faketime_stop_after_seconds=5 faketime -f @2016-12-25 $ date +%h:%m:%s vlc which allows proper video playback. still, i think it might be interesting to look into what goes wrong with vlc without faketime_stop_after_seconds, since that might be a bug in libfaketime.
