 URL : "https://github.com/llvm-hs/llvm-hs/issues/63" TITLE : pure assembly printer? BODY : i reach out to llvm-hs mostly to get an llvm ast and a printer to assembly for it. right now, i use this code: ast2assembly :: module -> io string ast2assembly m = either error id <$> withcontext \c -> runexceptt withmodulefromast c m modulellvmassembly which works, but it would be nicer to use a pure haskell solution here. have you considered printing the ast to assembly in pure haskell? this would also avoid the segfault that i am currently seeing with the code above.
