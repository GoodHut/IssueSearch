 URL : "https://github.com/fvsch/devtools-svg/issues/4" TITLE : insert code field BODY : it would be nice to have a field for getting the icon insert code svg with <use/> with a predefined modifiable template. this would be the most useful for your own projects not so much whenever you just peeking at other projects of course , so you could use this extension for getting a code for any specific icon you have. and the default template could be also a nice way to promote the best practices for inserting the icon like with a <rect></rect> stretched above the whole icon, which fixes a few issues by itself etc.
