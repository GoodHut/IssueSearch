 URL : "https://github.com/jchatkinson/ng-svg/issues/9" TITLE : write component tests BODY : the angular cli generates some boilerplate test files when a new component is made, but as far as i know these aren't very useful as-is. it would be nice to have someone more knowledgeable than myself write some good tests and leave lots of comments so we could learn from it and adapt it to other components.
