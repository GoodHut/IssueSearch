 URL : "https://github.com/system76/unleash-potential/issues/1" TITLE : do packaging better BODY : right now it involves putting things in /usr/bin/<python files here> and /usr/share/unleash-potential/<asset files goes here> and using direct paths. this is kind of a pain. let's implement an easier way to create .deb files. also if you notice, all of asciimatics is here! it would be great if that wasn't the case. so either we should package it not the best option , or we should find a way to more seamlessly include it in our package.
