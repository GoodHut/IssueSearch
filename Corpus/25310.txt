 URL : "https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware/issues/2010" TITLE : wifi doc questions BODY : hi/, please add to docs +code, maybe : wifi.sta.clearconfig immediately breaks an existing connection odd, if you just want to write a new config to flash and keep online status after that, wifi.sta.get default config returns old values should be nil wifi.sta.getapindex returns 1 should be nil it's not clear from the docs, how to juggle with wifi configs: how to decide when to clear/recover to a default config virgin/crashed device , in which slot does a config save=true land, how to rewrite a specific slot, does some algo automagically select the best config signal strength , does it switch networks when the device is moving? i suppose, the sdk imposes that shortcomings, sorry for couriosity. ty
