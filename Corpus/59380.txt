 URL : "https://github.com/skiselkov/BetterPushbackC/issues/12" TITLE : tug approach distance. BODY : this is a fantastic plugin. one suggestion, if possible. it seems that the approach of the tug is at a distance from the front of the plane that causes it to appear through the wall of the airport terminal structure instead of in front of the structure. would it be possible to have it appear at a distance compatible with the length of a typical loading bride or, possibly, from the side of the aircraft.?
