 URL : "https://github.com/greshny/diffbot/issues/7" TITLE : problem with hashie 3.5 BODY : hi there, we're not able to upgrade to hashie 3.5.1 which improves compatibility with ruby 2.4 because of the following issue: /bundler/runtime.rb:94:in rescue in block 2 levels in require': there was an error while trying to load the gem 'diffbot'. gem load error is: uninitialized constant hashie::extensions::coercion::rubyversion did you mean? ruby_version using hashie 3.4.6 is fine though. any idea how to fix the problem? is the diffbot gem compatible with ruby 2.4? thanks!
