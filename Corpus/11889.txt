 URL : "https://github.com/flynn/flynn/issues/4202" TITLE : log sink support BODY : hi, i found that remote syslog servers are supported. https://github.com/flynn/flynn/pull/3606 but it has not been documented on how to use the syslog inside an app. does this just push the logs we can see on the dashboard to a syslog server? i was trying to connect to the syslog socket inside the container -> /dev/log but was not able to. is it lack of documentation provided?
