 URL : "https://github.com/TotallyMehis/Influx-Timer/issues/37" TITLE : csgo timescale fix BODY : i talked to blacky and he said he doesn't use host_timescale he also mentioned something about stamina. he did say he showed it in one of his videos i think it was this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v6kg2_2xgw also saw this in his comments m_fllaggedmovementvalue recreates timescale pretty much because it runs frametime = frametime m_fllaggedmovementvalue before any players move funcs are called the only thing is this doesn't apply to the server like timescale so you have to use the value of it to give the player their time and mess with the replay bot as well xdï»¿
