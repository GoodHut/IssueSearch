 URL : "https://github.com/OPM/opm-simulators/issues/1181" TITLE : opm well control model BODY : hi all, for the keyword wconprod, it seems like opm only supports two control modes: orat and bhp. here is my set up for production and injection well: wconprod -- item :1	2 3 4 5 9 'prod' 'open' 'orat' 8.500e-4 4 1900 / wconinje -- item :1 2 3 4	5 6 7 'inj' 'water' 'open' 'rate' 8.50e-4 1 9014 / i know the flow rate is small. if the control model is orat, there is no water produced in the production well. if i change the control model to bhp, water is produced. but the production rate of water is always the same as oil, which is half of 8.5e-4 bbl/day, even at the very beginning when the water saturation is super small around the production well. does anybody know what is the problem here? i can provide input file if necessary. thanks a lot!!
