 URL : "https://github.com/koalazak/dorita980/issues/57" TITLE : cleaning by zone. BODY : hi, i was looking for a way to program roomba to clean only part of a house and havenâ€™t found any. 900 series model can map a house. so it should be possible to select a zone eg.: kitchen or living room on the map and ask roomba to clean just that area. is this possible to do using this framework? regards, alexey
