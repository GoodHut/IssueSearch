 URL : "https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-plugin/issues/1730" TITLE : re-center metamask title BODY : ! screen shot 2017-07-03 at 3 28 36 pm https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/542863/27809436-5b5b8ec2-6004-11e7-98a1-1b04a6034f60.png i simplified our title's flex management to make it less of a nightmare, and part of that makes the title just flex between the other elements. opening this to postpone fixing that awful css. maybe we just remove that title, or left-align it or something.
