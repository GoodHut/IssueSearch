 URL : "https://github.com/http4s/http4s/issues/1434" TITLE : response monoid instance BODY : after 1424 is merged we will have valid from a response directly. the final return type if f response , however with good use of fs2 you would generally arrive at stream f, response with stream representing 0-infinite responses. i believe obviously our server should only generate 1. however we could supply a monoid instance for stream f, response to allow use with runfoldmonoid as to return an f response i believe implementation would be zero being internalservererror as we did not generate a response, and return the first response otherwise. this would be associative but not commutative, if my understanding serves me.
