 URL : "https://github.com/spatie/laravel-medialibrary/issues/464" TITLE : more unified api for v5 BODY : problem in media.php the getpath method is used to return the mime type of a file: php public function getmimeattribute : string { return file::getmimetype $this->getpath ; } but when using amazon s3 the getpath method doesn't exist on the urlgenerator which can result in some error on a production server that uses the s3 driver while it will work fine on local development and a local file driver. proposed solution 1. throw a clear exception when using getpath with the s3 driver instead of calling the non-existing method for easier debugging. 2. store the file mime type in the media table, either in a new column or in the custom_properties column as an optional feature. or 2. make a head request to the file on s3 to get the mime type slower i will gladly make the pr myself if the proposed change is accepted :
