 URL : "https://github.com/WEC-Sim/WEC-Sim/issues/201" TITLE : unclear on the process BODY : hello, we are a bit unclear on how the process goes from the moment we finish up the model in solidworks to the moment we are simulating in wec-sim. we are using nemoh for our bem calculations and that takes in a .dat file but solidworks puts out a .stl file. how do we go about this? is there a way to get solidworks to give us .dat files of our model so we can input them into nemoh? we can't use wammit because the demo version on their site wont run on my windows 10 machine. if i am not mistaken, after nemoh does the calculations, we feed those files into bemio and that will create the hdf5 files. we then take those hdf5 files and refer to them in our wec-sim input file. any help would be appreciated.
