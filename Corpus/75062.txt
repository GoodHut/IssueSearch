 URL : "https://github.com/ilia3101/MLV-App/issues/36" TITLE : future of edit dock area BODY : first it was just a dock area, the we began to add tabs, now we were talking about 3 or 4 tabs, some of them would be very full, other tabs would have a few elements. i was thinking about how to do it different. i really like lightroom and got some inspiration from there: i created collapsable group boxes. this looks like that proof of concept via a test dialog : ! pic https://image.ibb.co/jvj9d6/bildschirmfoto_2017_10_24_um_18_49_33.png so i would delete the tabs and add some groups... maybe like in the picture: - raw correction - general lr calls it basic - sharpen & blur lr calls it details - grade all groups are inside a scrollarea. one of the problems was, that when scrolling over a qslider, the slider changed its value, and the scrollarea stopped. i implemented a slider which can't be scrolled via mouse. how do you think about the collapsable groupbox version? do you like it? or do you still like more the tab idea? if you like this version, i could implement it, but it is some work... so i wanted to ask before ;-
