 URL : "https://github.com/bradmartin/nativescript-videoplayer/issues/80" TITLE : can't play video android BODY : we've been using this plugin for 2 months in 2 different apps. something changed about 2 weeks ago in our dev environments. our apps don't play videos anymore. i have the same problem with the demo project. i assume d that it is something we did, but i can't figure it out. we reinstalled nativescript. we reinstalled android sdk. we downgraded nativescript versions. nothing seems to work. so - i know we are probably doing something dumb. i just don't know what. in the demo app, the video never loads. so it won't play. it won't get a duration. it doesn't take up screen space. i added logging to videoplayer.android.js. video.prototype.initnativeview is never called. any clues would be greatly appreciated.
