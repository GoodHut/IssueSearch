 URL : "https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/12840" TITLE : anti-alias in 2d BODY : after looking at those issues: https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/10241, https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/7242 issuecomment-343637952 i saw that godot supports anti-aliasing using msaa, but i was surprised that this is only active in 3d. i tried to set it to 2x, 4x, and i saw a neat difference in 3d viewport, but none in 2d using line2d or polygon2d to test it . could it be made available in 2d too?
