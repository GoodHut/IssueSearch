 URL : "https://github.com/adrbrewer/assign_1_addie_taylor/issues/13" TITLE : home page footer BODY : on the home page, the footer bar is above the footer and in the body text. it might be that there are too many div tags and the computer isn't reading them correctly even though they're correct with the styling i added it's easier to see this . it also may be a conflict in the styling we're pulling and what we've written. in short, i have no idea why it's messing up and would appreciate if someone else could take a look. thanks!
