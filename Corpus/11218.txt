 URL : "https://github.com/mfs-git/watchall/issues/1" TITLE : flags in command BODY : hi there, it appears the package doesn't currently allow hyphens in command arguments. for example: watchall squeue -u thejohnhoffer prints a complaint from argparse that -u is not recognized. i would expect this script to only use argparse on flags that precede the command, as it should pass the remaining arguments unaltered to the command. i believe i've found a solution that's the same in python 2 https://docs.python.org/2/library/argparse.html argparse-remainder and 3 https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html argparse-remainder : replace python parser.add_argument 'args', metavar='arguments', type=str, nargs=' ', help='command arguments' with python parser.add_argument 'args', metavar='arguments', type=str, nargs=argparse.remainder, help='command arguments' this is a stronger nargs=' ' that also accepts flags untouched. i'm testing this now for my own application. many thanks for writing a great package!
