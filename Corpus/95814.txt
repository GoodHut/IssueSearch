 URL : "https://github.com/brianc/node-pg-pool/issues/46" TITLE : do query on new connection BODY : hello, i am trying to figure out how to handle my prepared statement already exists errors. is there a way to hook into the new connection created method and do something before calling its callback? it would be great if i could create some prepared statements, then run any queries. i noticed there is an option you can pass into pg-pool called oncreated but i dont see it being used anywhere in index.js . any ideas how to go about solving my problem? thanks
