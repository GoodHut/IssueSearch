 URL : "https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-solr/issues/79" TITLE : install issue on centos 6 BODY : on a pre-solr 5 install on centos 6 i am getting an error, because systemd is not installed: task geerlingguy.solr : copy solr systemd unit file into place for systemd systems . fatal: 127.0.0.1 : failed! => { changed : true, failed : true, msg : destination directory /etc/systemd/system does not exist } i don't immediately see why this is happening because the when clause should be skipping this step: $ ansible -ilocalhost, all --connection local -m setup -a 'filter=ansible_distribution ' localhost | success => { ansible_facts : { ansible_distribution : centos , ansible_distribution_major_version : 6 , ansible_distribution_release : final , ansible_distribution_version : 6.9 }, changed : false } would it be simpler to check for the existence of the directory and put the unit file into place only if it exists?
