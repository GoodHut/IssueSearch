my first feeling was that this feature of sharing via email didn t exist because it is not a t the right place...in the sharing button.
place as well other sharing stuf i see like blue tooth etc... 2nd eventually remove it from the right click menu...since having the same thing in different place is at least for me the sign we have a problem :d thank you for this great ap! it works very well :dï»¿ toto launchpad details: lp1507100 https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1507100 toto - 2015-10-17 07:23:13 +0000
