 URL : "https://github.com/sinairv/YAXLib/issues/54" TITLE : support for .net core BODY : have you ever considered adding support for .net core? with the current version of .net core xml serialization is quite bulky and having yaxlib at hand would be a relief. i already gave it a try and there would of course be some code adjustments necessary, mainly for conditional compilation in terms of reflection. but by making use of a modified version of the extension methods from https://github.com/stefh/reflectionbridge it should be feasible. interested?
