 URL : "https://github.com/NYRDS/pixel-dungeon-remix/issues/31" TITLE : un-fork this repository BODY : currently the repo is in the state 'forked from...', i think it's time to make this repo standalone. reasons: 1. this is no longer a 'real' fork of watabou's pd. 2. search in the code is disabled for forked repos. 3. while giving credit to watabou is important, there is already enough credit in the code etc. to achieve this, it's needed to delete the repo and create a new one, and push the local copy to it. precise instructions here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29326767/unfork-a-github-fork-without-deleting/41486339 41486339
