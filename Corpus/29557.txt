 URL : "https://github.com/matthewfranglen/dotfiles/issues/11" TITLE : make vimrc cautious BODY : :help except-compat > in the vim script language there are cases where scripts and functions continue after an error: in functions without the abort flag or in a command after :silent! , control flow goes to the following line, and outside functions, control flow goes to the line following the outermost :endwhile or :endif . on the other hand, errors should be catchable as exceptions thus, requiring the immediate abortion . the vimrc does not use the abort flag on any function. it also does not handle any errors. make it so that the state of the system is not assumed and that any failure is correctly handled.
