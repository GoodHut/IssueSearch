 URL : "https://github.com/frehage/Automata.jl/issues/1" TITLE : automaton abstract type BODY : what would you think of having a package creating an abstractautomaton type along with an api for using it ? i need this for this hybridsystems package https://github.com/blegat/hybridsystems.jl . an hybrid system both contains an automaton https://github.com/blegat/hybridsystems.jl/blob/35356b3ef96ff9b4591728fb736e51fc370778b6/src/hybridsystems.jl l13 and behaves like one https://github.com/blegat/hybridsystems.jl/blob/35356b3ef96ff9b4591728fb736e51fc370778b6/src/hybridsystems.jl l26-l30 . if there were a package defining the abstractautomaton api then it would allow hybridsystems to both work with any implementation of automaton without depending on any of them. in particular, if your package implements this abstract api, it could be used to construct an hybrid system. i have started the api here https://github.com/blegat/hybridsystems.jl/blob/master/src/automata.jl . i have tried to pick the same function names as the ones in this package. this should be moved in a package separate of hybridsystems.jl though.
