 URL : "https://github.com/danielgtaylor/jpeg-archive/issues/64" TITLE : support for ssimulacra? BODY : the ssimulacra metric promises significant improvements over ms-ssim. among other things, it might finally solve the issue where images with a big, uniform background and a small detailed object in the foreground get way too high scores, despite the foreground object being horribly garbled. any chance of this being implemented in jpeg-recompress? http://cloudinary.com/blog/detecting_the_psychovisual_impact_of_compression_related_artifacts_using_ssimulacra https://github.com/cloudinary/ssimulacra
