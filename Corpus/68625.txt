 URL : "https://github.com/stanle/madopt/issues/15" TITLE : segfault in c++ example BODY : this program contains ipopt, a library for large-scale nonlinear optimization. ipopt is released as open source code under the eclipse public license epl . for more information visit http://projects.coin-or.org/ipopt this is ipopt version 3.12.1, running with linear solver mumps. note: other linear solvers might be more efficient see ipopt documentation . number of nonzeros in equality constraint jacobian...: 2994 number of nonzeros in inequality constraint jacobian.: 0 number of nonzeros in lagrangian hessian.............: 1997 total number of variables............................: 1000 variables with only lower bounds: 0 variables with lower and upper bounds: 1000 variables with only upper bounds: 0 total number of equality constraints.................: 998 total number of inequality constraints...............: 0 inequality constraints with only lower bounds: 0 inequality constraints with lower and upper bounds: 0 inequality constraints with only upper bounds: 0 segmentation fault: 11 the segfault is happening when calling m.solve . tried also with ipopt 3.12.7 and get the same result.
