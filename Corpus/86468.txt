BODY : i was searching for a while without luck, i need to set the type of the document to something different than the default typeof codesantitheftdevicemodel .name . i have the below example. var elasticsearchuri = new uri host ; elasticconnection elasticconnection = new elasticconnection elasticsearchuri, index: alias ; elasticmapping elasticmapping = new elasticmapping false, false, false, false ; elasticcontext = new elasticcontext elasticconnection, elasticmapping ; in a method. var linq = await elasticcontext.query<codesantitheftdevicemodel> .tolistasync ; elasticcontext ends up with the following uri, http://host/alias/codesantitheftdevicemodel/_search, but in elasticsearch type name is antitheft_device_code. i will need to have http://host/alias/antitheft_device_code/_search, any ideas?
