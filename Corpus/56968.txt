 URL : "https://github.com/serge-rgb/milton/issues/41" TITLE : panning broke in 1.3.0 BODY : when i use the middle click button on my mouse, i can pan. on my wacom bamboo tablet, the button is set be a middle click. it doesn't pan. oddly enough, if i go in my wacom settings, change the button to something else, then set it back to middle mouse button, the panning works for a single time. after that it stops working again. hopefully that helps.
