BODY : the various plotting functions have a bunch of arguments for controlling grid lines: hlines , vlines , hlines_col , hlines_lwd , etc. these are formal arguments in most of the plotting functions but are hidden in plot_scan1 . we should be consistent about this. they add painful clutter to the function definitions. maybe just describe these things in the details section of each help file? or add a section, hidden graphics control parameters ?
