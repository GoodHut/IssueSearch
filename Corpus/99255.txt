 URL : "https://github.com/ImagicTheCat/vRP/issues/181" TITLE : menu up key wrong bindings BODY : hello, when you open up the menu with up key and use the menu, and if you want to go up an entry in the menu, it goes back and eventually closses the menu. could you add in a hotfix for that? its quite annoying when you are trying to use the skin shop and the menu keeps popping up when you press the up key. thanks
