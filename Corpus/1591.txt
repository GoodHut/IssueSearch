 URL : "https://github.com/TOGoS/TMCMR/issues/30" TITLE : adding a gui BODY : i'd like to use tmcmr in my projects and will write a gui for it and start programming in the next weeks. it will require some major changes and refactoring, but i think it will be worth it. what has to be done: - extract the rendering core and make it usable as a library generating bufferedimages. - separate the command line from the rendering core and make it use that rendering core. - create a custom swing component that can display the world using the core for generating the images and lwjgl3/opengl for rendering them. that component might be used like a library in projects as well. - create a standalone gui using the swing component the user will be able to use instead of the command line. but before i start, i'd like to hear your opinion on it, because i won't waste my time coding something for nothing. so, what do you think?
