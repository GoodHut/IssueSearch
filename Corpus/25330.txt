BODY : hi, could this software be coded to work as a windows service? this way we don't have to launch it every time we want to emulate a 360 gamepad if we want it to behave like that all the time. it could also handle connection issues, as when sleeping the system that it won't work after that if you don't restart the app. btw, is there a way to know the remaining battery of the controller?
