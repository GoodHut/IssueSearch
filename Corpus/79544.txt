 URL : "https://github.com/boss-developers/oblivion/issues/1826" TITLE : skaafin for oblivion.esp BODY : <https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/48096/?> this mod adds a new race to oblivion and places one member of that race nearby clavicus vile's shrine. skaafin are a humanoid race of daedra in service to clavicus vile in elder scrolls online, so i figured...why not have them in oblivion? they're enabled as playable, have a unique ability and characteristic/skill spread. they will also be included in another mod i manage on another website.
