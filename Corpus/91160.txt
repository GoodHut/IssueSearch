 URL : "https://github.com/cernopendata/opendata.cern.ch/issues/2130" TITLE : system: add files service BODY : add a new files service that will be basically identical to the web service in that it will serve cod3 application. amend nginx proxy rules to send all /files/ requests to the files service with a sufficiently low number of maximum simultaneous connections. this will ensure that even if some users will start long-taking download jobs via files service , the rest of the cod3 site will keep its responsiveness via web service . it also helps to better isolate cod3 application from eospublic in case of troubles of the latter service.
