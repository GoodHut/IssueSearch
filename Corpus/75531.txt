BODY : here's how i see this working: a to wants to run a tournament and use this database to record the results. the to files an issue asking for their tournament to be registered. an admin adds the tournament to the tournaments table 1 . an access token for that tournament is generated and given to the to. the to uses this access token to upload results. somehow, we want to ensure that queries made with this access token can only create game entries whose tournament foreign key references the tournament associated with the access token. i'm not sure how to do that in sql yet . when the tournament is over, we revoke the access token for the sake of security. possibly create a public mysql user with only select grants. if this becomes a load/spam problem, then get rid of that and instead put up a web front-end. 1 this step should be automated, but let's presume a manual workflow for the beginning until we get better at all of this.
