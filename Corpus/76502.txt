 URL : "https://github.com/Porto-SAP/Hello-API/issues/98" TITLE : laravel passport & scout BODY : tl;dr : are you gonna implement scout and passport into hello-api? let me start off by saying: this code base is amazing, great job! i have not build a project with it, but i am more exploring it for research purposes for a future project, and using this for it would be amazing. but i do have a question about laravel passport and laravel scout: are you planning on implementing these? i am not too worried about scout myself, since its pretty straight forward, and i could do that myself. but the passport is a whole other story, since this project is so deeply woven with dingo. and currently dingo doesn't support passport, there are some custom providers that kinda work but not really. thanks! wouter
