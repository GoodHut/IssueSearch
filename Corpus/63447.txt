 URL : "https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/issues/1070" TITLE : drop python 2.6 support BODY : i'd like to propose that paramiko drop python 2.6 support in its next release. one of paramiko's dependencies has already dropped python 2.6 support pynacl , pip is dropping 2.6 in its next release, cryptography has deprecated 2.6 but has no timeline for removal due to downstream dependencies like paramiko , and download counts for paramiko's latest version show very little 2.6 usage. in the last 2 months paramiko has had 3566507 downloads of version 2.2.1 which was the latest version for almost all of that time . here's what the download breakdown by python version looks like for that: 1 | 2.7 | 2247813 |   2 | 3.6 | 88395 |   3 | 3.5 | 84743 |   4 | 3.4 | 27094 |   5 | 2.6 | 22841 |   6 | null | 4218 |   7 | 3.3 | 600 if we assume that all nulls which result from downloading via either a client that doesn't report data or a pip that is too old are also python 2.6 that leaves us with 27059 python 2.6 downloads. this is 0.76% of the total downloads and would appear to demonstrate that removal of 2.6 support would be very low impact. additionally, users on 2.6 can always pin to an older version anyway
