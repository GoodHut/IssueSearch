 URL : "https://github.com/ghcollin/tftables/issues/2" TITLE : hdf5 dataset path question BODY : from @dolandack : > hi, i am brand new to python and i am trying to use your code to train on tensorflow using datasets other than mnist. when i am following your guides there is this line: array_batch_placeholder = reader.get_batch '/internal/h5_path/to/array' > > i do not really get what this pathway refers to. tensorflow is quite different from r and matlab that i have been used to use until now and i cannot really check the variables by executing small batches of the code. the /internal/h5_path/to/array is it something i should provide? i know that in the: reader = tftables.open_file filename='path/to/h5_file', batch_size=20 i use the h5 file path. > > i tried to understand following the more applicable examples that you are offering but to be honest i feel quite lost.
