 URL : "https://github.com/quidsup/notrack/issues/203" TITLE : apache and mysql BODY : hey guys, thanks for the awesome notrack. i have an ubuntu home server which already functions as a dhcp server. it was easy to set up notrack but i already have apache2 und mysql running on it. i do not want to migrate my setup to mariadb or lighttpd, but use apache instead. it it working fine sites in the block list get blocked , but the web interface shows zero dns queries and zero blocked sites. the dashboard says nan% allowed/blocked so it definitely has trouble reading the files on the harddisk . probably a basedir restriction but i could not find a solution. secondly sudo notrack states an error if it can't locate the lighttpd access file. would be great if we could have a switch to use the apache access file instead. a simple symbolic link did not help. i bet due to the wrong logging format of apache. i wonder why notrack wants to read this file in the first place. does it calculate the blocked / allowed domains there? best regards, simon
