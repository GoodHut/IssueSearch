 URL : "https://github.com/fuse-box/fuse-box/issues/891" TITLE : flash of unstyled content BODY : first of all thank you for making this great tool. the compilation speed fuse-box is near instant for me. i notice that during my web application starts there's a visible flash of un-styled content, which i assume is the result of loading css dynamically hence javascripts can be executed before css is parsed. is this an intentional trade off? and are there any option to opt out of dynamic css loading. thank you very much!
