 URL : "https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/3133" TITLE : regression popup blocking BODY : i reported this yesterday as a comment in 3129 but it's a separate issue so filing a new one here. the global rule $popup does not block all popups in the latest 1.14.15b1, but it does in 1.14.8. for examples, see 3129 the regress occurred in 2919, which was fixed after 1.14.8 was released. the particular cause is this assumption https://github.com/gorhill/ublock/blob/69241fb3db078fb9e72fca9479ecee327aa67390/src/js/tab.js l760 in the latest code. i commented out the aredifferenturls check, and now my modified 15b1 blocks all popups with that rule. i consider this a regression, because if i tell ubo to block all popups it should do so. just like any other resource type.
