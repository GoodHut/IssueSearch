 URL : "https://github.com/mozilla/network-pulse/issues/441" TITLE : more friendly form errors BODY : while posting a new entry today, submit didn't work and it wasn't clear why. as you'll see in the screenshot below, the button is enabled, but a click yields no action. i assumed there was a bug. i scrolled up to take a screenshot, and only then noticed the error message on one of the fields. to make this more friendly, we should do something. maybe scroll up to error on submit attempt. maybe show an error by button that has a generic message to correct an error up above. <img width= 1116 alt= screen shot 2017-03-22 at 11 52 57 am src= https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/53411/24207159/95c35b4e-0ef6-11e7-864b-49c578961faf.png >
