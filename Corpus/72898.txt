 URL : "https://github.com/kaltura/nginx-vod-module/issues/648" TITLE : chunk request parameters BODY : when requesting dash chunks i get fragment url something like this: fragment-5-f1-v1-x2.m4s i understand that -f means file id, -v means video id and -a means audio id. but what does mean -x? does it really required? it seems that nothing changes when i change or delete -x parameter. also, can you please describe what additional parameters can be used besides -v, -a and -x ? thank you!
