 URL : "https://github.com/dino/dino/issues/80" TITLE : cannot set alias BODY : i set some alias on pidgin for my other chat users. i've added them not as contacts to dino. but i cannot change the alias. i expected this option in 2 menus: rightclick the contact and open details in the start chat menu. it seems the edit button there is completely broken.
