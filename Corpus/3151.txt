 URL : "https://github.com/danpaquin/gdax-python/issues/150" TITLE : l2 order book BODY : i submitted an l2 implementation which i'm looking for feedback on . it operates a bit differently -- though it's not difficult to port over to the current format orderbook as as subclass of the websocket client . i've chosen not to subclass websocket because i use it to run through logged messages and not real-time .
