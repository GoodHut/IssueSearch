 URL : "https://github.com/BuiltBrokenModding/MFFS_Classic/issues/21" TITLE : won't launch in modpack BODY : hello! i can get mffs and voltz engine to run in normal minecraft, using 1.7.10 forge. however, whenever i put it in a modpack, and upload it to technic, it doesn't work. i first thought that it was conflicting with other mods, so i put mffs and voltz along with the codinglib download in there own modpack. the modpack downloads fine, however whenever i launch it, it will get to 19-25%, speed up to 100%, go to the black transition screen then crash. however, there aren't any crash files. any idea as to why this is happening? love the mod btw, works extremely well with forge.
