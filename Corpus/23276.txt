 URL : "https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/6217" TITLE : opt-in virtual dom BODY : what problem does this feature solve? a lot of complex ui elements generally reside outside of v-for which is where virtual dom may hypothetically be helpful, looking through ui frameworks few provide extensibility or that is the degree of freedom that you would see without virtual dom, pretty much none of it relates to rendering lists. what does the proposed api look like? an option to render v-for with virtual dom implying that virtual dom is absent elsewhere, and is entirely opt-in. <!-- generated by vue-issues. do not remove -->
