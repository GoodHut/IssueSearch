BODY : hello, it's me again :d is it possible to use proxies? since i'm building a project which has a lot of connections to twitch chats, each streamer in my database gets his own connection. and since it's only allowed to connect 10 times per second it is quite slow. thaths why i would like to use a proxy, or multiple proxies to fasten up my project.
