 URL : "https://github.com/coala/coala-quickstart/issues/148" TITLE : add system-dependent mode BODY : just an idea that i had in mind in system-dependent mode we can suggest/activate bears based on the existing bear dependency installed on the user's system. for example activate cppcheckbear if cppcheck is already installed in the system. on the other hand, we'll still have a system independent mode which assumes nothing about the system and can be useful in using quickstart remotely.
