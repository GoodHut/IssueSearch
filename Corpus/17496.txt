 URL : "https://github.com/aruntk/polymer-apollo/issues/15" TITLE : polymer 2.0 mixin BODY : i'm looking at polymerapollo right now, trying to convert your behavior to 2.0 syntax. some things to discuss are: - where to put beforeregister stuff? this has been removed with 2.x, i think this might belong into the constructor now 2.0 is class based like standard webcomponents - how do we create the polymerapollo behavior? i was thinking doing it like so: export const polymerapollo = superclass, options => class extends superclass { and then in the component do this maybe? class appshell extends polymerapollobehavior polymer.element, apolloclient { please let me know what you think, i'm just learning classes now, so i'm not sure if that makes sense.
