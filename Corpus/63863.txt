 URL : "https://github.com/tarsius/ghub/issues/16" TITLE : expose response headers BODY : there are lots of neat things that could be done by paying attention to response headers: https://developer.github.com/v3/ rate-limiting https://developer.github.com/v3/ conditional-requests i don't expect ghub to handle these after all, it's the miniscule github client , but it wouldn't be crazy for ghub+ to handle them smartly if they were made available. since we want to keep the main json response as simple as possible to use, it would probably be best to use something like this: defvar ghub-response-headers nil an alist of response headers from the last request. when a method is called, this variable is reset to be an alist of the headers for that method. for example, you should expect to see at least the following headers after calling \ ghub-get \ /meta\ \ : \ \ request . \ /meta\ \ \ method . \ get\ \ \ \ status\ . \ 200 ok\ \ \ \ x-ratelimit-limit\ . \ 60\ \ \ \ x-ratelimit-remaining\ . \ 58\ \ \ \ x-ratelimit-reset\ . \ 1495154422\ \ \
