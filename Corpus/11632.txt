 URL : "https://github.com/okta/okta.github.io/issues/880" TITLE : improve odic doc BODY : this is a more general todo, but our odic doc could use some work. i was confused specifically around our description of the nonce and state . after brushing up on the oidc spec https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html these values are clear. so even a pointer to the spec would be an improvement.
