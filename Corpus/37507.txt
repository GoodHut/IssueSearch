 URL : "https://github.com/facelessuser/sublime-markdown-popups/issues/26" TITLE : mdpopups 2.0 roadmap BODY : - require sublime 3124 and greater for proper functionality. get rid of legacy styling. people should be on at least 3124. if they want to stay on old sublime builds, they are going lose proper mdpopups css. - there will be a notification on the forum to give plugin developers a chance to update plugins before 2.0 releases. - should use sublime css variables for things like colors in default css. that way they will get colors directly from themes as sublime will auto-gen things like --background, --purplish, or a theme can define these themselves. we will rely on themes and sublime to give us this. - no longer output css for things like .string or .comment etc. this clutters the css class namespace and risks breaking peoples plugin styling if i ever after add new classes. instead, developers must use template filters to get the syntax css for given classes. - provide just a default.css. no more base and default, just default. have one setting to disable default css called default_style . no default_formatting and default_style , but just default_style . they either want to use the default or they can disable it and use their own in a custom mdpopups.css. maintaining separate css for colors and formatting is annoying. we actually provide very little color out of the box now and will now use css variables that should already be provided by sublime --background, --purplish, etc. . plugins can still take advantage of syntax style classes, but default css will not use those. - x default styling for admonitions. - x default styling for kbd. - x force a monospace font for code blocks. can obviously be set to a users specified font via custom user mdpopups.css. roadmap subject to change.
