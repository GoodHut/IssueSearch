 URL : "https://github.com/WickyNilliams/headroom.js/issues/274" TITLE : just won't work BODY : no matter what i do, what i try, this just will not work. i've looked at the play area, more examples than i can count, been up and down the comments of others having issues or complaining about the extremely bare bones documentation on how to set this up... i've created my own styles, used other's examples, copied and pasted the author's own files... i've wasted hours trying to get this to work. maybe spend a few minutes creating a skeleton version of this thing that works. jesus.
