 URL : "https://github.com/nikestep/html-angular-validate/issues/25" TITLE : inline ignore rule support BODY : the label for rule is important for accessibility; however, with angular, directives can encapsulate the inputs away from the individual html file and cause this tool to flag it as a warning, the “for” attribute of the “label” element must refer to a non-hidden form control. it would be nice to ignore the rule in this 1 instance instead of my entire project similar to how eslint would allow an inline ignore. example: &lt;label for= timeselector class= small &gt; select time {{timezone}} :&lt;/label&gt; &lt;div id= timeselector timepicker ng-model= settings.time hour-step= 1 minute-step= 1 show-spinners= false show-meridian= true &gt;&lt;/div&gt;
