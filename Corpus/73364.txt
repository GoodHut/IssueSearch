 URL : "https://github.com/stealjs/stealjs/issues/89" TITLE : create a debugging guide BODY : i just paired with manuel on an issue https://gitter.im/stealjs/steal?at=5a0c31c671ad3f8736e8d293 and he gave me some helpful tips for debugging a production build. first, we set bundlepromisepolyfill , minify , sourcemaps , and sourcemapscontent to false in the steal-tools build options https://stealjs.com/docs/steal-tools.buildoptions.html : js var buildpromise = stealtools.build { config: __dirname + /package.json!npm }, { bundlepromisepolyfill: false, minify: false, sourcemaps: false, sourcemapscontent: false, dest: __dirname + /target } ; second, we used the production.html in the project and changed the script tag to: html <script src= ./node_modules/steal/steal-sans-promises.js env= production main= steal-canjs-example/app bundles-path= target/bundles ></script> this got us to the point where we could see what was throwing the error. itâ€™d be helpful if these starter tips were in a guide.
