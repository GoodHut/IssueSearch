BODY : is it possible with your approach to support answer feedback i.e. add explanations to answers ? https://support.google.com/docs/answer/7032287?hl=en i suspect it would require adding another column for each answer for the feedback ? i have a parser for gift format that creates json objects https://github.com/fuhrmanator/gift-grammar-peg.js , so i'm wondering if your approach could be integrated without using a spreadsheet as an intermediate ? gift format is in many ways more intuitive although has its drawbacks .
