 URL : "https://github.com/EricMaeker/freemedforms/issues/180" TITLE : data import mechanism BODY : i'm a bit new to freemedfoms so sorry if this question has been answered somewhere else in the documentation. is there a data import mechanism for data used in another electronic medical / health record ? i would be interested in particular with importing data from the almapro software which you might have heard. it also stores it's data in mysql so manipulating the data to migrate could probably be doable with a little work .
