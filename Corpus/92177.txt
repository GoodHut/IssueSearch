 URL : "https://github.com/betravis/icon-methods/issues/3" TITLE : view element as a wrapper BODY : as far as i know, there’s yet another method: <view> as a wrapper; just like symbol method, but using <view> instead of <symbol> . for example: <view id='rabbit-symbol' viewbox='0 0 45 55'> <path … /> </view> if this is true, please add it, even if it’s not supported yet. btw, is there a trick —i.e. using a js script— to make all these methods work in all browsers?
