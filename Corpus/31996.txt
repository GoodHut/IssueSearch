'/../library/global.php'; // create new router instance $router = new core\router ; $router ->addroute 'foo' ->setroute 'foo/:bar/:acme' ->setformat array 'bar' => '\d+', 'acme' => ' a-z0-9 +' ->setendpoint array 'controller' => 'foo', 'action' => 'bar' ; // start the application, passing in the router new core\front 'myproject', $router ; but by checking the contents of the variable $route we can see that it contains the most total nothingness. php core\router object _routepath:core\router:private => some idea?
