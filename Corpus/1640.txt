 URL : "https://github.com/Team-Optimystical/Palette/issues/1" TITLE : bugs & stuff BODY : - most back background does not fill the screen, it is too much to the right. - sometimes when going too far, the parallax is ok with length until it teleports back to start the next loop, and then you can suddenly see the left cutoff of the image, very low priority . - make front background parallax image the vertical extensions nicer. - perhaps because big front background parallax image, loading is slow for pressing host ~3sec . maybe add a small level is loading gif? or something else idk. - running left does not animate anymore. - the animation for the other player doesn't show up through network. - mention in the instructions about the 'p' pause button? - make one of the shine or sean buttons greyed out to show that the other player already is shine or sean?
