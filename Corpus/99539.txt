 URL : "https://github.com/realbigplugins/client-dash-admin-pages/issues/4" TITLE : more intuitive position ui BODY : at some point it would be cool to introduce some ui that is a little nicer than simply setting a number. users have no idea what the number means and it doesn't really work exactly the way they'll expect anyway. should be acceptable for now but we should make it better in the future. you know...now that i think more about it...i'm wondering if that's right. do we really need the position setting at all right now? i'm almost thinking we should go with no option for that and just setting the number automatically since they can use the menu management feature to move it if they want. either that or actually going the distance of creating a nice, intuitive option for setting position from the get go. thoughts?
