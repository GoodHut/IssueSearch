 URL : "https://github.com/mikedh/trimesh/issues/103" TITLE : just a question BODY : hello @mikedh , thank you for this wonderful library. i just have a question. the trimesh library seems to use pyassimp library. from my experience using assimp library in the past c++ had always resulted in problems. because assimp is more of a rendering framework than a modelling library. so if there is a requirement to keep the information of vertices indices, face indices, edge indices intact and same as the loaded file then assimp kind of failed. this was my experience with assimp c++. does it behave the same way with the pyassimp too? otherwise i really like your library to load and preview meshes quickly. regards, 0k
