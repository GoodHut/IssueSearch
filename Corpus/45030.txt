 URL : "https://github.com/alexa/alexa-avs-sample-app/issues/565" TITLE : gpio wake not working BODY : got everything working fine through the java sample app, i would like to replace clicking the listen button with a hardware button not interested in the always on approach so i am interested in using the gpio trigger, seems this has been purged from all instructions but i found the command in an older version of one of the files, so in terminal 3 i am running: cd ~/desktop/alexa-avs-sample-app/samples/wakewordagent/src sudo ./wakewordagent -e gpio this starts up without issue, however it doesn't seem to work. looking at the code it uses gpio2 pin which is pulled high via hardware so its kind of surprising that the code appears to trigger on a rising edge but i guess that works if you pull low and then let it bounce back up upon release.. the problem is that when i do this nothing happens. i can use the built in gpio commands to verify that it is actually changing state so it doesn't appear to be a hardware or wiring problem... one thing i notice is the info debug statements in the gpio file don't show up in the dialog - the ones from the wakewordagent do but not the gpio speciifc ones.. is that expected? any guidance on the gpio approach? so close just need to trigger via button
