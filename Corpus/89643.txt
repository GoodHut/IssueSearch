 URL : "https://github.com/realm/realm-mobile-platform/issues/262" TITLE : realm files are kinda fat BODY : i'm not really sure which realm repository to use when reporting this, but since i'm heavily reliant on the realm object server, i'll put it here. i have been migrating from an sqlite solution to realm over the past year, and one thing has me worried. i took a user's sqlite database and migrated it into a corresponding realm with similar data structure . the sqlite database is a mere 821kb and the realm file is 469.8mb . ! realm-vs-sqlite https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2513753/29957201-f8bfb204-8ea0-11e7-8a84-1b01de073842.png i imagine the realm file has lots of magic built into it for syncing, but a 500x increase? this makes hosting super expensive. if i have 1000 users with an average realm size of 500mb, i'd need a 500gb vps. that would be outrageously expensive for a relatively small number of users. i sure hope i'm doing something wrong because i don't feel like i'm storing a crazy amount of data. here's a view of the realm opened up: <img width= 2178 alt= realm-sample src= https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2513753/29957299-95c9535c-8ea1-11e7-8611-45f0a1c762d9.png > any ideas?
