 URL : "https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/issues/6860" TITLE : implement recipe pattern BODY : see https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/issues/5992 as a developer, i have a flexible recipe installer that i can use to install groups of modules together, and have all necessary dependencies automatically met, so that i can scaffold a project based on a set of pre-defined sets. acceptance critera: - if i add a recipe to any project via composer require <recipe> and it will setup any required project files e.g. page.php for cms - i can use any recipe as a base via composer create-project <recipe> and it will setup any required project files. - a recipe exists that will install a full silverstripe and cms install - a recipe exists that will install a framework only minimal installation - a recipe exists that will install all necessary testing tools e.g. behat, phpunit and .travis.yml uses this - a release via silverstripe/cow will automatically release all necessary recipes and create a tag for each. - a recipe is not a module, and can only require other modules, or bootstrap the root project files. nice to have: - there is minimal duplication between recipes; a core change e.g. modifying a dependency constraint of silverstripe/config should only need to be made in the core recipe. - a tool exists that will inline any recipe, adding it's dependencies to my root composer.json, allowing me to customise them after the fact.
