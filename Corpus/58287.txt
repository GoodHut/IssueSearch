 URL : "https://github.com/egoist/poi/issues/248" TITLE : separate vue to preset BODY : <!-- please don't delete this template or we'll close your issue --> <!-- before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of poi. --> do you want to request a feature or report a bug ? probably feature <!-- issues which contain questions or support requests will be closed. --> tldr; separate vue to preset like react ---- the preffered way in doc says to use yarn add poi --dev ie. add poi to project but package poi depends on vue if i want to use it with react it still installs vue and other vue packages which pollutes the project with unneeded dependencies meaning it would be nice to have vue support extracted to separate preset like react
