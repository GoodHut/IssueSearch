 URL : "https://github.com/Starcounter/Starcounter/issues/4044" TITLE : changelog not generated BODY : hi! i'm using the hot table for displaying data on the client. in the table i have a column that renders a link. i've bound the highlighted row of the table to a corresponding index property of the server. the problem is that when i click the link the browser redirects but the table will also send the change of highlighted row to the server. the server generates the patch and sends to the client. but since the client has already gone to a new page the patch is invalid. i solved the problem by delaying the send to server by 200ms. during this sleep period i catch the click event and check if it's a href. if so i cancel the send of updated index to the server. this works so far. but now the problem is that if i just change rows in the table the index change is delayed and sent to server. the server updates as expected. but it doesn't send the patch to the client. the thread that executes the change has my session bound to it, but for some reason no patch is sent. the next time i click somewhere on the screen the patch is sent.
