 URL : "https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/issues/5042" TITLE : remove sanity checks? BODY : the emscripten sanity check mechanism has been a bit inconvenient for a long time. one issue is that it adds up time to each build. the contribution is not big, but it's still a number of msecs for each tool invocation. another issue is that the sanity check calls to java here https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/blob/master/tools/shared.py l449 , and on a clean os x system, java is not installed, but /usr/bin/java contains a stub application which pops up a message dialog asking user to install it: <img width= 714 alt= screen shot 2017-03-17 at 4 19 04 pm src= https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/225351/24047144/8517e3c2-0b2d-11e7-9cee-2c6670455edf.png > closure compiler is kind of deprecated, and people don't need java installed to use emscripten, so this is giving a misleading cue. i'm thinking about setting emsdk based installs to always enable em_ignore_sanity=1 environment variable to skip this work. although that still does check_llvm_version and check_node_version checks, which are redundant with emsdk since it installs all these tools at the same time. i'd like to bump up em_ignore_sanity to early out before those checks. @kripken: any thoughts on that?
