 URL : "https://github.com/ioos/catalog-ckan/issues/147" TITLE : dataset count is low BODY : dataset count https://data.ioos.us/dataset seems low today, any known issues on the ckan front that might be the cause? currently shows ~4200 vs 7000 in the registry. seems to be across the board not necessarily one particular provider . the obvious culprit would be solr, which seems to have periodic issues. any info in log files? have you ever tried looking at the solr webapp behind the firewall for troubleshooting data.ioos.us:8080/solr/ /~cores/ckan-schema-2.0, or something like that ?
