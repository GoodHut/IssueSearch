 URL : "https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client-java/issues/446" TITLE : possible ack leak BODY : we're using the socket.io-client v1.0.0 in our android project. having a connection open we've noticed sometimes when internet connectivity changes from mobile data to wifi the following error happens: > io.socket.engineio.client.engineioexception: websocket error io.socket.engineio.client.transport.onerror transport.java:63 io.socket.engineio.client.transports.websocket.access$400 websocket.java:24 io.socket.engineio.client.transports.websocket$1$5.run websocket.java:107 io.socket.thread.eventthread$2.run eventthread.java:80 java.util.concurrent.threadpoolexecutor.runworker threadpoolexecutor.java:1113 java.util.concurrent.threadpoolexecutor$worker.run threadpoolexecutor.java:588 java.lang.thread.run thread.java:818 that leads to the socket getting disconnected, reason being transport error the issue we've identified is upon a reconnection some of the registered acks will never get notified they remain indefinitely in the internal acks map in io.socket.client.socket . it seems some of the packets for those acks do not reach the server, in other cases they actually do but it's the response that gets lost. these are our socket options: io.options opts = new io.options ; opts.secure = true; opts.forcenew = true; opts.reconnection = true; opts.reconnectionattempts = max_reconnects; opts.reconnectiondelay = 2000; opts.transports = new string { websocket }; opts.upgrade = true; socket socket = io.socket socketurl, opts ;
