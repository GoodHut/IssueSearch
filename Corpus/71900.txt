 URL : "https://github.com/PointInside/ng2-toastr/issues/170" TITLE : angular component render BODY : i am passing a component into the toast content, i have {enablehtml true}. the component does not get recognized as an angular html element and rendered. is there a method to render the passed data as an angular component? ex: this.toastr.success '<toast toastmsg = here we go! ></toast>', null, {enablehtml: true, dismiss: 'controlled'} ; this doesn't render anything, cause it doesn't recognize the <toast> as an angular html component.
