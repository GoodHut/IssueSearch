 URL : "https://github.com/lukesutton/yopuy/issues/5" TITLE : abstract request payloads BODY : currently the service struct assumes that request bodies — post, put, patch — are encoded as form-bodies. but they may need to be json instead. ultimately the body is just a string . however, we don't want to allow raw strings to be passed in. that could potentially cause bugs. one approach is to require an requestencodable protocol. swift protocol requestencodable { var requestbody: string { get } } beyond the request body, it could be used to configure more details for the request, like: - authorization - mime-type - etag - caching - custom headers
