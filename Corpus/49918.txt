 URL : "https://github.com/bmmalone/urlearning-cpp/issues/19" TITLE : use a logging library BODY : currently, all status messages, etc., are written to stdout using printf. this is very restrictive, and a logging library should be integrated into urlearning. since we already use boost, its logging library http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_64_0/libs/log/doc/html/index.html seems like a reasonable choice.
