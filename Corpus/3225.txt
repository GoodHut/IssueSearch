 URL : "https://github.com/techfort/LokiJS/issues/617" TITLE : memory - loki BODY : i'm writing a mobile application and for saving data i'm using lokinativescriptadapter along with lokipartitioningadapter. i'm saving like 500 thousands of documents and for a mobile application i think this is a lot. so the problem is: i call load database when application is initializing so as loki is an in-memory database the application take a long time to initialize like more than 10 seconds. is there a way to load just a part of the database with only 2 collections or do i have to load the database with all collections?
