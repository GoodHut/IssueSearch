 URL : "https://github.com/Wikitude/wikitude-sdk-samples/issues/15" TITLE : multiple .wtc files BODY : hello there! i am developing an application with ar. in one section i need to have several .wtc files to recognise any target from the 10 .wtc files that i have, i've been watching the dinosaurs example several targets but in fact this is not the thing i need, because i don't want to recognise them all at once, but one at a time in the same js. furthermore, in that example, they only use one .wtc file, but i have created 10 because each one represents one sculpture in a museum or a dinosaur . i mean, i don't want all the dinosaurs in the screen, i want them one by one but in the same screen depending on the qr that i would be focusing.
