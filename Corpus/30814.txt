 URL : "https://github.com/sugarlabs/stick-hero-activity/issues/11" TITLE : readme.md is sloppy BODY : readme.md needs work. - running under sugar should use sugar-activity command, - is debian or ubuntu specific, does not mention fedora, - uses old apt-get instead of new apt , - should combine both dependencies onto one apt install line. readme.md should be written for three audiences; users, integrators, and developers. you must be very very familiar with the source code to write a good readme.md. for ideas on what else you may add, see https://github.com/sugarlabs/speak/blob/master/readme.md https://github.com/sugarlabs/browse-activity/blob/master/readme.md https://github.com/sugarlabs/polariactivity/blob/master/readme.md
