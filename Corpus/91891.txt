 URL : "https://github.com/yunity/karrot-frontend/issues/820" TITLE : upgrade to fontawesome 5? BODY : quasar extras https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-extras readme was upgraded to fontawesome 5, which is a complete overhaul of fa4 which we previously use. some icons were renamed: https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/upgrading-from-4 i think also the style changed a bit. do we want to do this upgrade? alternatively, we could install fa4 as additional dependency and not use the one bundled with quasar extras.
