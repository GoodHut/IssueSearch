 URL : "https://github.com/stephens999/stat302/issues/18" TITLE : confusion with notes BODY : in the posterior computation section pg 6 , one sentence says if $q$ is chosen to be irreducible and aperiodic, then this markov chain has stationary distribution . i am a little confused here, are we talking about the markov chain with transition probabilities $q x'|x $ or the markov chain defined by q x'|x a x'|x ?
