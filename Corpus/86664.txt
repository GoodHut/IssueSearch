 URL : "https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js/issues/1178" TITLE : immutable.hash and arrays BODY : following on from 1176, specifically the second bullet point in my comment https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js/issues/1176 issuecomment-287000974 consider: typescript import as immutable from immutable ; let x = 1,2 ; let a = immutable.hash x ; let b = immutable.hash x ; let c = immutable.hash 1,2 ; let d = immutable.hash 1,2 ; now a === b holds, but c === d does not. if this is the intended semantics that's absolutely fine but can i request a couple of things: we update the docs to be clear on the behaviour of immutable.hash on collection types maps, arrays we expose immutable.hashmerge or similar which allows the caller to achieve the effect of c === d by iterating a collection type themselves
