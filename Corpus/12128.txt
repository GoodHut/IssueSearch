 URL : "https://github.com/cloudfoundry/gorouter/issues/176" TITLE : mtls to backends BODY : thanks for submitting an issue to gorouter . we are always trying to improve! to help us, please fill out the following template. issue communication between gorouter and backends is unauthenticated and unencrypted. context security policies may require all connections to be mutually authenticated as well as encrypted. as gorouter<->backend communication is in clear text, cloud foundry as a whole may fail to meet security policies. steps to reproduce deploy an application to cloud foundry. make a request to it. expected result applications should be able to specify that they expect ssl connections in which case the gorouter should create a tls connection and present a client certificate. the backend should be able to validate the client certificate against a ca cert either to be found on the filesystem somehow or in an environment variable . current result connections from gorouter are in clear text. possible fix as part of an application's manifest, it should be able to specify that it expects ssl connections. this setting will be passed on to the gorouter which will then make ssl connections to the given application.
