 URL : "https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-js/issues/957" TITLE : need assistance @fehguy BODY : resolver.js seems to be very dirty bit of code, i constantly find new and new bugs there which block my own work with swagger ui. and everything is related to such simple mechanism like $ref resolving. having more than 900 lines of code here doesn't look good, with all this heavy raw string processing. $refs are slightly complex thing to work with: they allow recursive/cyclic referencing. strictly speaking, you can't just completely unwrap jsonschema eliminating all the refs. but you can use ability of dynamically typed languages to make pointer with simple assigning: javascript a = {b: 3}; a.c = a; // here a.c works exactly like $ref to a this prevents infinite consumption of memory to store the scheme. but downloading and storing the scheme/specification doesn't seem to be the only operation resolver.js does. it has some fragile and unspecified logic of gathering model descriptions. i want to spend some time refactoring resolver.js, but i need kind of specification for these custom operations it does. would be much better to separate simple downloading the spec and it's modifying/aggregating. please help me there, @fehguy.
