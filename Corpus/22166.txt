 URL : "https://github.com/clwdev/precip/issues/60" TITLE : increase vm memory BODY : with only 2gb of memory and a large database, mysql locks are experienced relatively frequently. increasing this to 4gb alleviates this issue. proposed solution is to either increase this in the vagrant file or allow this to be configured in config.rb please let me know which you would prefer and i will raise a pr accordingly.
