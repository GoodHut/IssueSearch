 URL : "https://github.com/florianv/laravel-swap/issues/29" TITLE : it seems to be too slow BODY : i was comparing getting a value straight from fixer.io api and from swap, and it seems that swap is quite slower: php // it takes about 750ms file_get_contents 'http://api.fixer.io/latest?base=usd&symbols=eur' ; // it takes about 1800ms, even using fixer.io $rate = \swap::latest 'usd/eur' ; yeah, sure, it should be slower, but 1 extra second seems too much. is it making more than one request? anyway, thanks for this great library!
