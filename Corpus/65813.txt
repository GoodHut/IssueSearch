 URL : "https://github.com/lumien231/Hardcore-Darkness/issues/26" TITLE : licensing for this mod. BODY : hello, lumien. i would like to make a fork of this mod which implements more features on top of the changes to darkness, specifically the concept of gloom if you are familiar with better than wolves. yet i saw that the project lacked a specified license and therefore defaults to all rights reserved. would you be willing to use a permitting license or give permission for me to make this mod and release?
