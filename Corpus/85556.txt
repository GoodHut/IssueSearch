 URL : "https://github.com/codelibs/fess/issues/1384" TITLE : fess startup doesn't work BODY : hi i have unzipped fess on my vps and when i run the command to start it putty goes to the next line but nothing happens. i don't seem to be able to access it via the web interface either, as the address doesn't resolve anywhere when using ip address or domain . any help would be much appreciated.
