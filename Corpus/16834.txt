 URL : "https://github.com/blechschmidt/massdns/issues/22" TITLE : many fake records BODY : hi, i was running your tool on my vps , it was running fine for quite sometime but yesterday i installed it on new vps and i am getting weird result. there is one weird server 142.54.173.92 which is sending fake records , this server does not listed on resolvers.txt using from your repo . it looks like something is wrong. i have tried to traceroute this ip but last 10 hopes are not visible and i have also tried to see code massdns but it is in compiled format. i have copied your repo from my local system to vps wihtout using make command and once i received weird result , i delete entire folder and clone from online using git clone command and use make command .......still i receive this weird records from this weird server ...... it looks like two possible scenario , one of the resolver from list is sending records to this fake dns server 142.54.173.92 which is sending fake records as result. second could be somewhere in my vps , this records are stored due to using existing copy of the folder and re installation is not removing it .....i grep dns but i could not find any susceptible file ./subbrute.py names.txt example.com | ./bin/massdns -r resolvers.txt -t a -a -o -c 100 -w 18_dec_1.txt - 18_dec_1.txt https://github.com/blechschmidt/massdns/files/1573143/18_dec_1.txt note : i have changed result to example.com in above command and output file attached. i really appreciate if you can check on your side that if you are receiving this server in output or something wrong with massdns compiled file or can you provide me any lead to resolve this issue ? thanks, anis
