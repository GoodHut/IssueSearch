 URL : "https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/ethereum-lists/issues/186" TITLE : discussion: naming scheme BODY : currently the naming uses a 3 letter indicator for the network.like this: tokens-etc.json tokens-kov.json tokens-rop.json tokens-eth.json tokens-rin.json tokens-rsk.json i would suggest to use the chain-id. so you need to have one less mapping and it is more future proof. like this: tokens-rin.json -> tokens-4.json tokens-eth.json -> tokens-1.json
