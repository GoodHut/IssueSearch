 URL : "https://github.com/TeamCalALC/TeamCalALC.github.io/issues/2" TITLE : social media links BODY : at the moment i'm linking to a facebook group that i just made and then the aidslifecycle hashtag for instagram and twitter. https://www.facebook.com/groups/145319672770871/ https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23aidslifecycle https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/aidslifecycle/?hl=en seems like we should have a better one for the team? maybe teamcalalc ? i searched for that but couldn't find any posts on either twitter or instagram so at the moment it would be rubbish no interesting pics but we could add some new ones?? what do you think?
