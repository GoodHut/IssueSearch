 URL : "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-dsl-py/issues/642" TITLE : field restrictions on get BODY : i'm trying to determine if i can restrict the fields returned on a get operation from a doc type. e.g. doc = document.get id=doc_id, fields= 'text' i see that the library does support arbitrary kwargs in theory, but fields and source are not supported. any pointers? many thanks!
