 URL : "https://github.com/symphonyoss/ContainerJS/issues/156" TITLE : do we use jekyll plugins? BODY : i'm having problems running the site locally. in order to preview the documentation, i'd like to run: $ jekyll serve /usr/local/cellar/ruby/2.3.0/lib/ruby/2.3.0/rubygems/core_ext/kernel_require.rb:120:in require': cannot load such file -- bundler loaderror from /usr/local/cellar/ruby/2.3.0/lib/ruby/2.3.0/rubygems/core_ext/kernel_require.rb:120:in require' from /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/2.3.0/gems/jekyll-3.2.1/lib/jekyll/plugin_manager.rb:34:in require_from_bundler' from /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/2.3.0/gems/jekyll-3.2.1/exe/jekyll:9:in <top required >' however, this fails due to the gemfile https://github.com/symphonyoss/containerjs/blob/master/docs/gemfile. i haven't dug into the details of the error, but found that if i delete this gemfile it works! is it really needed?
