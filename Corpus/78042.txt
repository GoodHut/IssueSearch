 URL : "https://github.com/dustinmhorvath/OneStopIDS/issues/3" TITLE : passenger fails to start BODY : may be related to a permission problem. passenger was trying to mkdir and write some files to $snorbydir/../.passenger/. however, after creating that folder and chowning www:data:www-data, i'm still seeing failures for passenger to load. currently testing an older installation method for passenger to see if that's the root cause.
