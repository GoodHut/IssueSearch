 URL : "https://github.com/dimpu/angular2-markdown/issues/49" TITLE : ability to extend renderer BODY : given that your using marked.js and it's designed to be extended it would be benificial to have direct access to the renderer via the service . so maybe export the service and give an accessor to the direct renderer so users can extend the rendering functionality for example i need to have more control over image rendering which i can do in marked via the renderer by extending the image syntax .
