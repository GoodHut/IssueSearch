 URL : "https://github.com/andrewpbray/infer/issues/36" TITLE : handling of nas BODY : currently, if the input data has an na, no warnings are shown but the resulting simulated statistics vector can have some nas since calculate doesn't specify to handle nas when taking mean, median, etc. one option is to specify that in calculate. the other option is to make the user get rid of nas first in the exploratory stage, and then feed the data into the infer steps. former is a bit more user friendly, but hides an important consideration. latter can be tricky for students when doing inference for two variables since they would need to remove pairs of nas from both variables. thoughts?
