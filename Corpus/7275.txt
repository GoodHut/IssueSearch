 URL : "https://github.com/Door43/ulb-en/issues/517" TITLE : ezra 7:27; 8:15 BODY : ezra said in these verses is not in the heb. the lengthy direct quotes that follow are not needed. it would be better to delete ezra said and have a note that ezra spoke of himself as if he were someone else in the earlier part of the book and is now speaking autobiographically.
