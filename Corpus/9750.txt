 URL : "https://github.com/codekitchen/dinghy-http-proxy/issues/28" TITLE : add cors support BODY : i am using docker-compose for a web api. i am developing a javascript front-end in a separate docker-compose project. i found that cors was not enabled for the api endpoint. in a fork, i have added support for cors to the nginx.tmpl . i am now able to reach the api from the front-end via cors enabled xhr request. i have a pr ready if you would like to consider adding cors support.
