 URL : "https://github.com/google/openhtf/issues/574" TITLE : run tests over the webgui BODY : is it possible to restart a test over the web_gui? i want to setup a station with a test for a pcb. the openhtf script runs on a raspberry pi. the test operator has another pc on whitch he opens a browser and starts the test. if one pcb has passed can i restart the test from the web_gui or how is the concept for that? and one other thing is it possible to extend the station api to get a progressbar for every phase? thank you and have a wonderfull day, jonas
