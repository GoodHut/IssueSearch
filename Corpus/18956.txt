 URL : "https://github.com/willtim/row-polymorphism/issues/1" TITLE : variants in unify BODY : in the constrainedrows version tvariant does not appear in unify. is it the same as trecord ? unify tvariant row1 tvariant row2 = unify row1 row2 also in injection the type is: inj label : t -> var {label : t | r} i understand the r in this case, without it two variant couldn't be combined. but for example inj just 5 , in this case the type is var {just : int | r} , didn't we lose information now, since we know that this variant will only have a just label, but after injection it can be more than just just . is this the wrong way to look at row polymorphism?
