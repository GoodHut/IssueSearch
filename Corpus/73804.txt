 URL : "https://github.com/apex/apex/issues/639" TITLE : deploy with dependencies BODY : hi, just wondering if it's possible to have deploy process to build the function under a specific sub folder, and deploy the sub folder. currently the dependencies are build into the function source folder, which makes it a bit hard to source control the project when the project has multiple functions, and each has different dependencies. thanks. andy
