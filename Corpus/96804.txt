 URL : "https://github.com/there4/slim-test-helpers/issues/36" TITLE : first example is incorrect BODY : when trying the same as the first example you have in your readme.md file, calling $this->client->response->getbody ->getcontent returns in my test meaning the following does not work: php $this->client->get '/' ; $this->assertequals 'hello world', $this->client->response->getbody ; your example code: php class versiontest extends localwebtestcase { public function testversion { $this->client->get '/version' ; $this->assertequals 200, $this->client->response->getstatuscode ; $this->assertequals $this->app->config 'version' , $this->client->response->getbody ; } } we have our own version replicated of webtestcase as we have our own config and setup process. to get it working, our test make-up is the following: php public function testhomepage { $body = $this->client->get '/' ; $this->assertequals 200, $this->client->response->getstatuscode ; $this->assertcontains 'hello world', $body ; $this->assertcontains '<title>welcome</title>', $body ; } the main difference with mine is that i am assigning $body = $this->client->get '/' ; as ::get calls ::request but ends with return string $this->response->getbody ; . am i missing something or have the docs not been updated? i can pr on the fix in the docs providing i am not missing something first.
