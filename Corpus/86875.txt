 URL : "https://github.com/Shippable/support/issues/3714" TITLE : in: repo for a runci job? BODY : i have a runci managed through it's shippable.yml job that needs to sync another repository it doesn't depend on any other runci/runsh/etc job completion, it just needs the code in another repo to build . an example of what i want: - name: client_runci type: runci steps: - in: devexi_cirepo or - in: devexi_develop_gitrepo obviously neither of these are supported - runci doesnt accept a repo as an in. what's the workaround for this? managing repo access secrets and manually git cloneing with logic inside the shippable.yml?
