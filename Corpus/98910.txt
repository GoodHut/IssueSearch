 URL : "https://github.com/goord/ece2cmor3/issues/21" TITLE : ln sp vs sp in gg/sh files BODY : hi @goord , cmorizing our files from the latest ec-earth version, it fails because it is looking for the surface pressure in the sh files to calculate the levels. it is due to the commit 3842 https://dev.ec-earth.org/projects/ecearth3/repository/revisions/3842 that you made in the primavera branch saying to output the pressure level in the gg files and not in the sh as before keeping only lnsp in the sh . i can update the code to tell ece2cmor to compute the levels from exp ln sp but i wanted to check if you hadn't already had the same problem. i think we would lose less information than using ps from the gg files. thanks, cheers,
