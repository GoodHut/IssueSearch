 URL : "https://github.com/coolbho3k/manuf/issues/8" TITLE : strange import path BODY : hey, it seems like current version published on pip and master here as well exposes macparser class in manuf.manuf.macparser path. this is pretty strange, and makes an example in readme slightly wrong import manuf ; p = manuf.macparser you can either from .manuf import macparser in manuf/__init__.py as a backward-compatible solution, or just get rid of manuf.py all together and move everything over to __init__.py .
