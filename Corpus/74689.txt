 URL : "https://github.com/mmozeiko/RcloneBrowser/issues/64" TITLE : feature request - search BODY : hello. first thanks for this app that is just wonderfull. could you please implement search feature into gui somehow, so it searches directly from source or just through refreshed crypt remote file list. i have trouble sometimes with duplicated entries and would like to check if some data exists already on cloud. i know there is overwrite feature and compare, but still would think that this would not be a problematic to implement. thanks.
