 URL : "https://github.com/afklm/jira/issues/96" TITLE : download url & checksum BODY : the base url changed for downloading jira software has changed. cookbook generates links similar to https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/downloads/binary/atlassian-jira-software-7.2.7-jira-7.2.7-x64.bin now url should look like https://downloads.atlassian.com/software/jira/downloads/atlassian-jira-software-7.2.7-x64.bin this brings me to point that i think it would be better to use a plain attribute approach for urls and checksums. the way to the cookbook is set up with checksum and url method requires changes to cookbook each time new jira version is released. a plain attribute scheme would be easier and more flexible. something like below suffices default 'jira' 'versions' '7.2.7' 'url' = 'https://downloads.atlassian.com/software/jira/downloads/atlassian-jira-software-7.2.7-x64.bin'
