 URL : "https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club/issues/641" TITLE : dijkstra's algorithm vs a BODY : should developers forget about dijkstra's algorithm? <!-- describe the issue briefly.--> should dijkstra's algorithm be replaced with a in the swift algorithm club and forgotten in general since a is a faster variation? or do you think dijkstra's algorithm is good when first learning about pathfinding? also from what i've seen, a will default to dijkstra's algorithm based on the heuristic function used? is this correct? <!-- if necessary, start off with the code snippet. put the code in between to format them into code blocks.-->
