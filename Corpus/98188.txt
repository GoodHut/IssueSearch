 URL : "https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-tests/issues/1" TITLE : improvements to the readme BODY : as a user new to the adopt openjdk area the readme needs to have more information in it. it would benefit from a section along the lines of 'what is in this repository and why would i want to use it?' in addition i've been trying to follow the steps outlined and there are some changes required there too. in the section below there isn't a test directory, the instruction cd /test/testconfig doesn't work as testconfig is at the top level. in addition it would be useful to put in an example for the format of the platform_on_which_to_test . ideally there would be a list of all the available platforms which are valid for running tests on this could be a link out to another github project containing the releases . cd /test/testconfig export java_bin=/location_of_jvm_under_test export spec=platform_on_which_to_test export java_version= se80|se90 se90 default value make -f run_configure.mk
