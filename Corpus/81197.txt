 URL : "https://github.com/SpiderOak/SpiderOakMobileClient/issues/742" TITLE : webassembly based crypto BODY : webassembly first version has been validated by the 4 major browsers https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/02/where-is-webassembly-now-and-whats-next/ , chrome mobile 57 already supports it without a flag and support is in active development on safari side https://webkit.org/status/ specification-webassembly . webassembly allows to perfom client side encryption/decryption with, for example, argon2-browser https://github.com/antelle/argon2-browser wasm + js library. keeweb https://github.com/keeweb/keeweb/commit/349fca7643fbd151ce7b17a36f6763213cceb89b uses it for example. leveraging webassembly could allow spideroak mobile app to remove the need for this intermediate server https://spideroak.com/manual/spideroak-on-mobile which is actually a big flow in the zero knowledge promise, would make it possible to provide real sync on mobile and would allow to provide these features also in web browser extensions for example. any thoughts?
