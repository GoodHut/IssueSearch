 URL : "https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/17213" TITLE : docs have broken links BODY : e.g. this link doesn't work <https://facebook.github.io/react-native/releases/0.45/docs/running-on-device.html running-your-app-on-ios-devices> and it's referenced from <https://stackoverflow.com/a/44835285/3586413> seems pretty bad practice to not have preserved old links
