 URL : "https://github.com/sangria-graphql/sangria/issues/229" TITLE : add scalaz support BODY : both doobie https://github.com/tpolecat/doobie and http4s https://github.com/http4s/http4s use scalaz, and it would be awesome if there was support within sangria. i see monix is supported, which already has streams similar to scalaz so i feel like implementing this wouldnt be too extreme. the obvious reason for this is the benefits that come with using one asynchronous method for all parts of an api. currently, my method is getting a request, sending it through sangria, resolving it, then awaiting the future and sending it off to http4s.
