 URL : "https://github.com/AdamNiederer/vue-mode/issues/51" TITLE : add support for mime types BODY : syntax highlighting breaks when script tag or maybe anything else has specified mime type like this: ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10955264/30810024-56d4aa2e-a20c-11e7-9309-61a16707efb9.png that is not necessary in script tag from vue point of view, it was added because of webstorm ide syntax highlighting breaks for it without specified mime type . sure, fixing deficiencies of another editors and paid ides ! is kinda ridiculous, but, alas, emacs-users are in minority. i made it to work for myself in https://github.com/adamniederer/vue-mode/blob/master/vue-mode.el l84 replacing space by dot at 47th position. if it doesn't conflict with vue specs, maybe we're able to add it?
