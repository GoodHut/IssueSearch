 URL : "https://github.com/dblodgett-usgs/NCDFSG/issues/5" TITLE : add featuretype handling BODY : this will require a bit of rethinking since there can be multiple featuretypes and/or multiple systems of x/y/t/variables. should probably unpack a file by looking for featuretypes to establish assumptions that can be made first then passing sets of variables to the reader function to get them back as spatio-temporal data.
