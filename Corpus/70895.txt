 URL : "https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/issues/439" TITLE : 0x05d clean state of app BODY : on android, when you app goes in the background, its killed, but the data/state is saved. once the user opens the app, you get object called savedinstancestate, which contains the data from the app. for simplicity lets assume it looks like this: textinput username = random text name = random you can, fill the view with the data from the savedinstancestate object, without consulting the server. -> should be added to 2.9 testing for sensitive data in memory. question is if the server should be asking first the server when the app goes again in the foreground if the session is still valid. if it's not valid delete state. state should then also be deleted after a timeout set on client side.
