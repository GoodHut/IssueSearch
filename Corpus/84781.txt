 URL : "https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2327" TITLE : docs theme not responsive BODY : hi, i'm reading the docs and working on code at the same time with somewhat narrow windows. the flask docs have a big sidebar on the left that is not always useful, and worse the body text has a fixed width that pushes it off the right side of the page. makes it very hard to read without constantly scrolling. doesn't fit in with old-school html wrapping or new responsive hotness. disabling: div.document { / width: 940px; / } with the dev tools fixed the width problem, responsive css could disable the sidebar when the window is narrow. cheers,
