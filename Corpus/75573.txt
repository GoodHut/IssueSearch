 URL : "https://github.com/serenity-bdd/serenity-documentation/issues/111" TITLE : how to disable reporting BODY : hi all, i have a java project and i'm using serenity + jbehave, my pom.xml looks like: <dependency> <groupid>net.serenity-bdd</groupid> <artifactid>serenity-core</artifactid> <version>1.2.2</version> </dependency> <dependency> <groupid>net.serenity-bdd</groupid> <artifactid>serenity-jbehave</artifactid> <version>1.21.0</version> <scope>test</scope> </dependency> <dependency> <groupid>net.serenity-bdd</groupid> <artifactid>serenity-junit</artifactid> <version>1.2.2</version> </dependency> this java project will run as a aws lambda function to execute all bdd stories. the problem comes because when this runs tries to generate the reports with the results of stories to local folder. so, i'm looking for the way i guess configuring in the pom.xml file to disable reports generation but i haven't found anything related neither documentation. any link or idea to make this? any help it's appreciate! thanks you all
