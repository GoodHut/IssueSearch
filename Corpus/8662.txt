 URL : "https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/7173" TITLE : r package cache BODY : we're using the r package cache in our builds https://travis-ci.org/mlr-org/mlr heavily. without the cache, we hit the 50 minute timeout yes, we need a lot of packages to be installed . the recent upgrade of r in travis invalidated the cache and we now have to start from scratch. the problem is that the cache is only populated by successful builds and we time out every single time not even close to succeeding . we've tried some things to reduce the build time, but were unsuccessful. is there a way to pre-populate the cache with a list of packages, or a special job that can be run for this purpose? the alternative for us would be to manually reduce the number of packages and iterate until we have enough successful builds that the cache contains a sufficient number of packages that the main build succeeds again. needless to say, this would be a huge pain especially as we would have to redo this every time the r version is upgraded . @craigcitro @hadley @jimhester
