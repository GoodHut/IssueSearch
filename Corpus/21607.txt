BODY : if for some reason, one forgets to resolve a promise that is last chained call it tail-promise for convenience's sake using then method, what are the consequences? does it cause resource leak of any sort? and if so, is the effect cumulative? we are currently using q inside a non-trivial node.js-based server, and we use promises quite extensively. some of the promises are long-chained and nested. we have found some of the tail-promises to not call resolve as expected, from time to time. although the server appears to function properly, i'd like to know if this has some bad effects. thanks!
