 URL : "https://github.com/Aurorastation/Aurora.3/issues/2518" TITLE : newmap xenofloral issues BODY : the room isn't bugged but it's still missing quite alot to be well functioning. xenofloral's atmospherics room was improved slightly but could still use some work. instead of a dedicated room, i think just having the pipes attached to connector ports under each hydro tray would be a much better design. i say this because you'd still be able to use the trays lid and it's own light source for plants. another thing is that there is no longer an all-in-one grinder in the room anymore, those are pretty necessary for getting the resources that plants produce. the lab is also missing some items such as syringes, and beakers. besides those things, a trash can would be really nice. i've got some design ideas for the room in a way that i believe would be most efficient. if you want to contact me, my byond id is dawsinn, i'd love to help. i'm also on the discord under the same alias.
