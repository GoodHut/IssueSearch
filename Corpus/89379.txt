 URL : "https://github.com/rpearce/react-medium-image-zoom/issues/47" TITLE : proptypes warning remains BODY : i realize this was probably fixed in 38, but the problem persisted for me: warning: failed proptype: invariant violation: calling proptypes validators directly is not supported by the prop-types package. use proptypes.checkproptypes to call them. read more at http://fb.me/use-check-prop-types check the render method of zoomportrait . that's even after updating to react 15.6.1. the only way i could remove it was by removing all references to proptypes altogether from the library: https://github.com/banzai-inc/react-medium-image-zoom/tree/without-prop-types any suggestions?
