 URL : "https://github.com/melmothx/amusewiki/issues/118" TITLE : please add backlinks BODY : i mean basically the functionality of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/special:whatlinkshere/main_page, a listing of pages that reference to the current page. it would be even nicer if its an pop up menu so i can access it with a long click . because often there are no back links that interest me. so i don't have to return from the back links page to page to the current by pressing back button on browser. thanks
