 URL : "https://github.com/terraref/documentation/issues/125" TITLE : revisit sensor naming BODY : - none of the side-look sensors appear to be included in this list - i think some of this is very ambiguously named. for example, the stereo-vis row is actually 2 rgb cameras. and don’t we have a flash on these cameras for night operation, plus all of those halogen lights? also, the name ‘3-d scanner’ always bothered me, it’s really a laser line scanner we have multiple systems that perform 3-d scans
