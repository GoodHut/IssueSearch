 URL : "https://github.com/hyperion-project/hyperion.ng/issues/467" TITLE : artnet inupt module BODY : we already support an udplistener to use hyperion as bulb from other sources. udplistener is something custom. would be nice to support professional/more standardized network input. at first i think of using artnet. then hyperion can be used from profesional light mixing console or software. also opensource software qlc can be used to create shows via artnet, so we can use it to test artnet input.
