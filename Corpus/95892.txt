 URL : "https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/4493" TITLE : documentation out of date? BODY : the wiki page at https://github.com/jruby/jruby/wiki/jrubyandjavacodeexamples seems to be out of date. using latest stable jruby 9.1.7.0 these examples contain many compile-time errors, and nearly every single method call into the org.jruby apis is deprecated. i tried correcting this myself, but my attempts were frustrated by the fact that the documentation does not seem to be written for jruby 9k at all it mentions 1.7 , and by the fact that most methods are not documented at all. it is best practice in the software industry that if you're going to deprecate something, you should say what to use instead. and it's not always clear what to use instead when methods are deprecated in org.jruby.ruby or org.jruby.javasupport.java, because these classes contain an ungodly number of methods with very similar names, most of which are undocumented.
