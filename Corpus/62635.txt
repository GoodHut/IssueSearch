 URL : "https://github.com/edemaine/coauthor/issues/240" TITLE : copy/paste author urls? BODY : currently you can drag an author name onto an editor, but if you can't reach during a drag operation scrolling while dragging is difficult/impossible , this isn't workable. what about copy/pasting? perhaps the editor could capture the paste event, and if it's just an author url, convert into an @mention ?
