 URL : "https://github.com/marbl/metagenomeScope/issues/41" TITLE : implement panning limits BODY : _from @fedarko on march 26, 2017 1:8_ we'd have to implement some custom functionality that is applied upon ending a pan gesture, as described here https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js/issues/1329 . however, i'm not sure if this would be really inefficient for large graphs. i think for now there are probably other things that take priority, but this would be nice to do eventually. _copied from original issue: fedarko/metagenomescope 178_
