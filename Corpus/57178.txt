 URL : "https://github.com/elmsln/elmsln/issues/1889" TITLE : polymer all the things BODY : planning session recap: - polymer elements are self contained, know they are editable / have an editable state and then an event firing after save - there will be a elmsln-save style meta-component that if placed after any other element, will attempt to ship information to the right place once noticing the saved event on the sibling before it. - in hax planning, a global behavior will react to the saved state being triggered on any element and queue it up for change - when save is executed it will bundle up all these saved events that were captured and ship them up to save the hax related node
