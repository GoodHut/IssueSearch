 URL : "https://github.com/nuxt/modules/issues/28" TITLE : icons rendered at 16x16? BODY : first of all, let me say the pwa module is fantastic. it works great and got me a 100 score on lighthouse on the app i'm working on with literally 0 configuration besides adding an icon. i did notice that after adding the 512x512 icon to /static, that the icon that's rendered in the browser is the 16x16 version, so it is very pixelated when rendered. is there a config option to use the higher quality versions? thank you for working on this project, this is amazing stuff.
