 URL : "https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el/issues/297" TITLE : issues on windows BODY : hi, the package seems to not work properly on windows with spacemacs & emacs 25.2: it seems like whenever i do for example spc spc mc/edit-beginnings-of-lines enter the command seems to expect something else and does not get issued. i then press esc and get that message: > error in post-command-hook mc/execute-this-command-for-all-cursors : quit i recorded a screencast to illustrate the problem: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0b_iqzqdc4vy8uwnkt1vxnwjpbgc the same spacemacs configuration works without issues on macos though. i'm happy to provide logs, tracebacks assuming you guide me on how to do so. cheers, thoms
