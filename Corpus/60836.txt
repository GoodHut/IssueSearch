 URL : "https://github.com/tloltman/Quibill-ionic/issues/30" TITLE : add login functionality BODY : so i updated the quibill-ionic project so you should be able to clone it into visual studio, run 'npm install', then run 'ionic serve' to run the project. i added a simple login page that doesn't do anything so your next task will be to set up the login functionality. the sample login page in the backend project should give you a good idea of how to do this. you'll have to add a button to the ionic login page, then tie the button to the login method in the login.ts script. that method will use an ajax request to post the username/password data to the server. the server should respond by sending a token which you can store in javascript sessionstorage. we might want to alter how the token is stored eventually. if the login was successful the app should use the navcontroller setroot to the 'home' page. that will be enough work for this issue i think. within the login.ts there's also an array property to hold any login errors. this property should be model-binded to the login.html page under the specified <ion-list using the angular ngfor technique a good example is on the all-transactions.html page . the backend login sample shows most of how you will extract the errors from the ajax response, but angular will make things even easier since you can just use the errors.push method to push any new errors into the array property instead of using jquery to add new elements to the page. it will probably take some time to get back into all the ionic stuff it did for me and this might be a tricky task so let me know if you have any questions or need clarification!
