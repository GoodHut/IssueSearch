 URL : "https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/issues/5692" TITLE : broken links on vcs page BODY : this page http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/terms-to-know on top instructs the students to read the vcs terms to know https://www.vikingcodeschool.com/web-development-basics/terms-to-know page. some of the skillcrush pages such as this one http://www.skillcrush.com/terms/cookies.html return a 404 error, but the first few pages load correctly. i think they may have moved. this issue was raised by @tempeste in the gitter chat, @eriktrautman might like to look? thanks, rhys.
