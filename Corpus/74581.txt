 URL : "https://github.com/jarulraj/sqlcheck/issues/19" TITLE : expose c++ api interface BODY : it would be a great feature to implement some kind of programmatic api to check an sql file either from path or from the contents given as argument so that 3rd party tools can be built around sqlcheck. my primary interest is to integrate this tool into an editor/ide for sql file linting. currently the only way to integrate this tool into an editor would be to run shellcheck as a standard command invocation from shell and parse the output, then map it to the lines and character positions. this approach is not very performant and would require a lot of work, especially in the output parsing logic. however, creating a stanard way to programmatically invoke shellcheck would work perfectly for this use case. unfortunately i am not proficient enough in c/c++ to send a pr, so leaving this here as a suggestion only. thank you for considering this feature!
