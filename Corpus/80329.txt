 URL : "https://github.com/Shopify/kubernetes-deploy/issues/225" TITLE : timeout on stateful sets BODY : hi, i tried to deploy a stateful set with a high number of replicas and each of them takes a few minutes to start. eventually, i ran into this error: statefulset/<my_service_name>: timed out limit: 600s . is there any way to override this timeout? i've seen this pr https://github.com/shopify/kubernetes-deploy/pull/130 , but the progressdeadlineseconds is only available for the deployment type and not for statefulset as far as i know.
