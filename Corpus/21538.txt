 URL : "https://github.com/mfikes/planck/issues/443" TITLE : fix sandbox builds BODY : we'd like it so that the clojurescript dep is not listed in the main dependencies, but only in the :build-release section. this lets us do builds against certain commits of the compiler. but, when doing a sandbox build and specifying an alternate repo location via a profiles.clj , the clojurescript dep is not downloaded. temporarily worked around in https://github.com/mfikes/planck/commit/36f70d991fbff8abf4805f46fd55181e3cb75332
