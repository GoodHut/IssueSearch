 URL : "https://github.com/Codeception/robo-paracept/issues/32" TITLE : groups are not same size BODY : hi, i am using robo-paracept to run codeception tests in multiple threads obviously . my problem is that i have about 200 tests which are splitted to 8 groups. for some reason some of the groups can be up to 30 tests long while some groups only have something like 5 or 6 tests. why is this happening? am i missing some configuration or is there a bug in the code?
