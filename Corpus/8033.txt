 URL : "https://github.com/bitExpert/magento2-force-login/issues/55" TITLE : match home page BODY : i tried entering / as a whitelist to allow the home page to match. but this seems to match all pages. i think the regex needs to match the specified page and no more. for the start this could just match the part of the request that magento considers the path, and at the end ignore any query string.
