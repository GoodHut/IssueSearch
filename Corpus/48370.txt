 URL : "https://github.com/tombenner/wp-mvc/issues/167" TITLE : routing does not work BODY : hello, i wrote a application with equivalent objects as the events calendar example, but my models are camelcase each model name prefixed with my app acronym 'cdj' to avoid naming conflicts with other plugins. wordpress permalink: cus/%postname%/%post_id%/tom structure: i tried /%postname%/ and /%postname%/%post_id%/ in my class cdjactivite i added: function to_url $object { return 'cdj_activites/'.$object->id; } in the debugger the code executes and takes effect on the resulting url as i changed the return value to see the effect i added route mvcrouter::public_connect 'cdj_activites/{:id: \d +}/{:extra: . }', array 'controller' => 'cdj_activites', 'action' => 'show' ; but i believe the predefined router rules should do it i just did it to make sure. but with the debugger i see that when i click on the view link from the wp-admin cdj activites list i get invariably the requested url /av-data/cdj_activites/3 was not found on this server. without the controller show method or the show view being invoked as i have breakpoints in the debugger.. av-data is my virtual host under apache pls advise i am new to your plugin i like the mvc concept. i can zip you the whole small application if you wish, but you may already have a simple explanation.
