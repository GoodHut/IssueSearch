 URL : "https://github.com/opencats/OpenCATS/issues/283" TITLE : multiple file uploads BODY : hi opencats developers, i just installed opencats and plan to use this in production. everything is going ok, so far. however, i thought i would put in a feature request. where i work, the administration loves to have supplemental documents other than resumes in the applicant portfolio. these supplemental documents include letters of recommendation, transcripts, etc. is there a possibility in the future to add a multiple uploads function within the user's frontend? this could be within their initial profile. thanks again for all the great work on this open source project!
