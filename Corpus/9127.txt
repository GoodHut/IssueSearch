 URL : "https://github.com/exercism/gui/issues/46" TITLE : the road to 1.0 BODY : the main blocker to reach 1.0 as far as i'm concerned is the lack of an installer 6 . seems that that feature will take time to implement see my last comment in the ticket 6 . maybe someone with more experience in electron can contribute here and speed it up. /cc @kytrinyx not sure what is the best approach moving forward here, would love your feedback on this. as i see it, we have two options: 1. we wait to have proper installers and only then give the gui as an option for the cli tool in the website. 2. we start giving the gui as an option for the cli tool in the website right now as a standalone tar.gz package that people should manually update also, please let me know if there are other issues or features you'd like to include to make a plan for a release. general feedback is welcome :
