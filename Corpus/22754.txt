 URL : "https://github.com/marcgibbons/django-rest-swagger/issues/684" TITLE : migrate from 0.3.x BODY : hello, i'm trying to upgrade from 0.3.x, i know everything changed and i'm trying to see how to make it work, but i'm having all these issues: - i have individual apps creating their own api urls, there's no django rest framework api at all since defaultrouter is not used causes issues , version 0.3 would still work with this and render all the urls created from singlerouter, but it doesn't seem the case with version 2, only 1 of the n apps are actually rendering their urls. - previously documentation was written through yaml comments on the viewset method, and it would render inputs automatically from the serializer. right now it doesn't seem to be recognizing the serializer values at all. is there any guide on how to migrate? thanks.
