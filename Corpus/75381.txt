 URL : "https://github.com/alanrenouf/vCheck-vSphere/issues/539" TITLE : hardware status warnings BODY : we had an esxi host throw a memory alert due to a bad stick. we replaced the bad hardware, cleared all the warnings in the vsphere web client but every day the vcheck report still shows that host with a memory sensor and status yellow. where is the report pulling this from because from what vsphere says, the host is fine but the report keeps showing the warning.
