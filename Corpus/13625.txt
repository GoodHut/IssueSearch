 URL : "https://github.com/neutronimaging/imagingsuite/issues/19" TITLE : web page scaling BODY : not really an issue, but a minor styling remark. the 1110x885 pixel gui is too big for small screens :- certainly the application will normally be used on large desktop computers, but the gui could easily be made more compact by using separate tabs for configure projections and geometry. and it is necessary to show only the projections image, except in the results/logging tabs, when only the slices image is necessary. or better, these images could be drawn in separate floating windows.
