 URL : "https://github.com/jweinst1/Wind/issues/14" TITLE : restructuring of syntax BODY : intro sticking to purely a linear syntax, such as: in 3 5 -> push 3 -> out is problematic because it makes it difficult to read or use constant expressions . in other languages, one might want to do a nested operation such as javascript var h = foo , .push hello! + world! for wind to be more widely used and applicable to many areas of software development, it needs to support a better flow of data, that can nest expressions where needed. currently, wind supports just a single scope of execution. moreover, the current object acting as the target of the executed instructions is not really visible. this should be changed to provide a more comfortable bridge between traditional dynamic languages and a full stream language. example new syntax this is one example of a new form of wind syntax 1 .push 2 .push + 3 5 .print -> list foo , 2 .print -> write file foo.txt , hello world! .close
