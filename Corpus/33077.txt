BODY : this idea has come up several times, most notably in https://github.com/r-spatial/discuss/issues/11 issuecomment-310889249 by @robinlovelace. i think it's worth a separate issue, so here we go. the idea is simple and quite intriguing , to have an equivalent to the tidyverse meta-package for spatial analyses needs. assuming we would consider creating such a meta-package think the most obvious and important question is: which packages do we think constitute the spatial analysis skeleton? if we can answer this i.e. if we can somehow agree on a core set of packages for spatial workflow then there are obviously other questions that arise: 1. shall we try to have a common lexical structure like the tidyverse , or is spatial enough as a common denominator? 2. how can we ensure smooth un-interrupted development with potentially many different developers involved ? 3. ... i leave this here, as i think many more questions will arise but it is only feasible to think about those if there is any solid plan to introduce a spverse , spidyverse , ...
