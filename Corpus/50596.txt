 URL : "https://github.com/Zishrodrigues/browser-technologies/issues/1" TITLE : 2.1: html - checkboxes BODY : careful with that, because you've actually broken checkboxes now for people with bad vision. don't rely on colour alone. and, more to the point: what if a browser doesn't support the :checked selector? easily testable by adding a typo in your code: :chekket . or drag ie8 out just for fun : it's perfectly fine to use :checked , you only need to change one thing to make it safe. what thing?
