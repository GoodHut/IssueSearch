 URL : "https://github.com/Code-Your-Future/syllabus/issues/12" TITLE : js core lesson 4 BODY : https://code-your-future.github.io/syllabus/js-core/lesson2.html please mention this issue in any prs, commits related to lesson 2 in js core. i would like to start a discussion on what should be covered in the advanced js lesson. here's a potential list in order of how important/useful i believe they are for core js: - scoping - this keyword - object prototype - bind, call, apply - recursion what do people think? any other topics we should consider? or should we give up most theory in this lesson altogether and focus more on algorithmic thinking?
