 URL : "https://github.com/knighty/fimfiction-issues/issues/146" TITLE : space between paragraphs BODY : when ever i post anything today, instead of the singe space between paragraph lines i usually put into the original story, i end up seeing four to five spaces in between. example: this is how it's supposed to look. > _paragraph 1_ > > _paragraph 2_ but this is what i end up getting. > _paragraph 1_ > > > > _paragraph 2_ i'm not too bothered by it, but this could get really annoying if i have to go through my work and delete spaces _every time_ i post now. do you know what's going on?
