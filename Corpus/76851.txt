 URL : "https://github.com/JelteF/PyLaTeX/issues/177" TITLE : make_temp_dir in windows BODY : hello again, i am using the package on both windows and unix. on unix all is fine, but on windows there is an issue with tempfile : python _tmp_path = os.path.abspath os.path.join tempfile.gettempdir , u pylatex out 5 : u'c:\\users\\userna~1\\appdata\\local\\temp\\pylatex' 2 problems are present: 1. \\ is not a valid separator in latex. a hack is simply replace r'\\', '/' 2. userna~1 has been truncated from username . my hacky way of fixing this is: python from pylatex.figure import figure as figure_ class figure figure_ : def _save_plot self, args, kwargs : tmp_path = make_temp_dir tmp_path = tmp_path.replace '\\', '/' tmp_path = re.sub r'/ ^/ ?~. /', '/' + getpass.getuser + '/', tmp_path extension = kwargs.pop 'extension', 'pdf' .strip '.' filename = '{}.{}'.format str uuid.uuid4 , extension filepath = posixpath.join tmp_path, filename plt.savefig filepath, args, kwargs return filepath however, would be good to come up with global solutions for these. i will give it a try when i am in the mood. posting this in case you can come up with some quick fixes.
