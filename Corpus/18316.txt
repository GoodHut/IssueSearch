 URL : "https://github.com/neilsustc/vscode-markdown/issues/20" TITLE : support for links BODY : the ideal ux, in my opinion, is what pasting detects url from the clipboard and does its magic. for example, before paste: ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101152/28305441-f8c0038a-6b9b-11e7-98ae-201c2eff0edf.png after paste: ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101152/28305454-03f75988-6b9c-11e7-9924-82b4f2603f08.png the next preferred method is a keyboard shortcut like here on github. i select text, press a keyboard shortcut ctrl+k would be ideal but that one is taken by vscode so probably ctrl+l which is the second most popular shortcut for md links in various editors and get this: ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101152/28305550-4d7ce208-6b9c-11e7-9f48-e0a05caf8bd0.png i can then paste the url which is in my clipboard. thanks for this awesome extension!
