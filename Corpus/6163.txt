 URL : "https://github.com/campus-experts/spring-2017/issues/47" TITLE : wrote a readme BODY : so i've been working on my honours project at uni pretty much full time. the project will eventually be open sourced once i've gone through the submission and grading process, but for now i've been asked to keep the repo private booooo . the initial readme was pretty much a table of contents for me to navigate around my documentation and project management quickly but i've now re-written it to be more ready for a public release. due to it being private, i'm just going to provide a screenshot as it has images . if you open it in a new tab it should be fairly easy to see, even a smaller monitor. i've taken some screenshots, spent a few hours building a heroku deployment button for users to demo the app quickly, and moved all the api documentation to a github pages site. because pages sites are always public, here's the link to that https://bluehatbrit.github.io/scaffold/ ! the docs are still a work in progress and some bits are out of date and are missing a lot of the routes, but you should get the gist of them. i went for the aviator template https://github.com/cloudcannon/aviator-jekyll-template by cloudcannon as it handles everything i need such as code samples, pretty response formatting, and some nice navigation. i pretty much just copy and pasted my wiki into the template so there's quite a lot of text in some places. ! https://gyazo.com/9b08c0455c259234d1f12c076c7b7fcc https://i.gyazo.com/9b08c0455c259234d1f12c076c7b7fcc.png https://gyazo.com/9b08c0455c259234d1f12c076c7b7fcc
