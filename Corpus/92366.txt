 URL : "https://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp/issues/185" TITLE : why drop netstandard 1.4? BODY : the release notes for messagepack-csharp ver 1.7.0 state the following: > from this release, new supports .net standard 2.0, but .net standard 1.4 support was dropped. i searched the issues and pull requests but couldn't find a discussion where the reasoning for dropping netstandard 1.4 was explained. can you explain why this was done? the reason i'm asking is because i have a library targeting netstandard 1.6 and i won't be able to upgrade to latest messagepack-csharp.
