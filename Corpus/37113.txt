 URL : "https://github.com/BurntSushi/fst/issues/48" TITLE : key positions in fst BODY : is it possible to: - return the key position from contains ? that is instead of bool return option<usize> where none means not found and some pos is the position of the key in the lexicographic order of keys represented by the automaton - return a key by its position. that is implement ops::index for set, such that myset pos returns the key at pos . if the above is possible then more possibilities open up: - map from bytes to bytes: set fst + int -> byte map possibly another set fst - map from bytes to ints, where ints are monotonically increasing when bytes are in lexicographic order this is very common when building search indices : set fst + succinct integer encoding
