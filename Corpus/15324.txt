 URL : "https://github.com/zeit/serve/issues/82" TITLE : default port 3000 BODY : i have been using the old serve library for quite a long time now. i was surprised that this package replaced the one from tj. there is one major difference which is quite disturbing for me. the old serve used to listen on port 3000 per default. couldn't we somehow restore that behavior? i know that this package copies a url with the current port to the clipboard. but i liked that i can just stop the server, do something, restart it and the already open tab in the browser just works fine after reloading. any thoughts on this request?
