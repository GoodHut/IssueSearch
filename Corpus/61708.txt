 URL : "https://github.com/huangblue/Algorithm/issues/1" TITLE : binary search algorithm BODY : binary search algorithm step 1: set low to 0, high to n – 1. step 2: if low > high, x does not exist in m and the algorithm terminates. step 3: set mid to low + high / 2. step 4: if m mid < x, set low to mid + 1 and go to step 2. step 5: if m mid > x, set high to mid – 1 and go to step 2. step 6: m mid equals x and the algorithm terminates. 来源：一本全面的c语言入门教程，p244 223
