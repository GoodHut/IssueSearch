 URL : "https://github.com/BernardoGiordano/PKSM/issues/517" TITLE : bulk move not setting dex BODY : when i withdraw an individual pokemon from pksm's bank to a game save, the game save updates the pokedex to have captured that species and form, etc. when i use the feature that withdraws entire boxes, however, it doesn't update the pokedex. this is a massive pain when it comes to maintaining a living national dex and using it to fill out new save files' pokedexes.
