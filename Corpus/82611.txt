 URL : "https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/8658" TITLE : allow options on uglifyjs BODY : meteor 1.4.4.1 package: minify-js former behavior: package author were able to setup options on uglify. new behavior: default options are now forced and there's no capability to setup new ones. expected behavior: allow package author to setup options on uglify. code would change from: js meteorjsminify = function source { var result = {}; uglify = uglify || npm.require uglify-js ; try { result.code = uglify.minify source, { fromstring: true, compress: { drop_debugger: false, unused: false, dead_code: false } } .code; into: js meteorjsminify = function source, options { var result = {}; uglify = uglify || npm.require uglify-js ; try { result.code = uglify.minify source, options || { fromstring: true, compress: { drop_debugger: false, unused: false, dead_code: false } } .code;
