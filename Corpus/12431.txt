 URL : "https://github.com/mariusor/mpris-scrobbler/issues/15" TITLE : per player logic BODY : since the mpris signals and metadata exposed differs on most of the media-players, i should implement some way of having a single point of verification for this information. then for each player i could implement this logic differently. current observed issues are: spotify doesn't populate correctly the track position property. triggers two signals with the exact same data when the track changes. audacious triggers an properties changed signal every time the track position advances. this leads to very high cpu usage because the scrobbler handles every signal. i don't know if there's a way to filter them.
