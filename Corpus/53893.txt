 URL : "https://github.com/milagro-crypto/amcl/issues/19" TITLE : expose functions in go BODY : hi amcl team, i noticed that many functions that any user of amcl would need e.g., ecp.add are not exposed in go i.e., have a name starting with lowercase . in the java version of the library, these methods are public. i think it would make sense to expose the same methods across the languages, and i'd particularly be happy if the following methods could be exposed in go note that this list is incomplete, there are probably many more functions exposed in java and not exposed in go that i don't list here, these are just the ones i need : - big.mod - big.frombytes - big.modmul - big.tobytes - big.invmodp - big.equals - big.modneg - ecp.tobytes - ecp.mul2 - ecp.getx - ecp.gety - ecp.add - ecp.equals - ecp.sub - ecp2.tobytes - ecp2.add - ecp2.getx - ecp2.gety - ecp2.mul - ecp2.equals - ecp2.sub - fp12.inverse - fp12.mul - fp12.tobytes - fp12.pow thanks!
