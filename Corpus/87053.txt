BODY : https://github.com/grandeemme/mpr121/blob/f67e5bc16a54a5d353f25cfa1164aa1434894cf9/src/main/java/com/mauromiranda/mpr121/mpr121.java l89 hi mauro, i came across your code while i was looking for pi4j driver for mpr121. after few hours spent with finding out why my interrupt pin does not provide any state changes i figured out that there is problem with its pull up/down setting. my mpr121 fires interrupts as low signal so with pull down setting there is no change on pin. imho there should be pull up set on interrupt pin. rinkishimo.
