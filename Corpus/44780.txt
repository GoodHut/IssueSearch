 URL : "https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri/issues/2598" TITLE : fix the documentation BODY : observed behavior we keep accumulating errors in our docs, now at 163 warnings. 1588 was addressing this but got closed. it's because no one is looking out for the warnings, and we cannot raise them to build-breakers. expected behavior we should always be at 0 warnings. user-facing consequences our docs builds contain errors that no one is aware of. broken references, missing references etc.
