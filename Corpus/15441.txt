BODY : $ razercfg --version razer device configuration tool version 0.39 razercfg -s mouse:naga epic:usb-00a-tin:foil-hat-0 razercfg -l all:off and razercfg -l all:on works however, razercfg -r does not change my mouse's dpi anymore . i have tried setting it to multiple different values between 100 and 4000 without noticing any difference. it used to work fine! i don't know what changed : i have razercfg -r 400 in my .xprofile /etc/x11/xorg.conf.d/50-mouse-accel.conf: section inputclass identifier razer razer naga epic driver libinput matchispointer yes option accelprofile flat endsection changing driver to mouse did not yield expected results either. i don't have any conflicting xorg configuration directives elsewhere that i can see i run kde plasma 5 on gentoo with sddm. this issue also occurs when using only awesome wm without a display manager. xset m has no effect on sensitivity either my cursor moves way too fast now and i would like to regain my sanity!
