BODY : hi ! your project is really helpful to me ! i'm parsing iccid numbers, to match them with the sim number written on the sim cards used in a machine-to-machine application. e.118 is the list of issuer identifier numbers, and those iin are the prefix to iccid numbers : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/subscriber_identity_module iccid. cf http://www.itu.int/pub/t-sp-e.118 for the publications of these iin. since it looks very close to your project, it may be useful to you ? thanks !
