 URL : "https://github.com/NREL/openstudio-geometry-editor/issues/186" TITLE : lockup on + image BODY : window comes up to browse for file, but then app freezes before i do anything i have not browsed yet or selected an image . i'm seeing this through os app, i noticed in issue 143 @shorowit was able to add images in, so maybe what i'm seeing is now, or unique to use in os app? i was able to repeat this on new project.
