BODY : hello. i have a big problem. two days ago, i have installed bitcoin wallet for the first time. on the same evening i sent a bit of money to my wallet adress shown in the app. they said it will take two days until my bitcoin will be shown on my wallet. so today i recieved an e-mail with the confirmation, that my bitcoins have been transferred to my wallet. when i tried to start the app there was only the message app kann nicht ge√∂ffnet werden = app can not be opend . i tried everything restarted my phone etc. but it still not worked. so i had to reinstall the app. but: the adress was not longer shown in the app and even the money was not there. i have no backup because i only used the app once. i hope you can tell me if there is anything what i can do now or if my money is away forever : thank you! sincerly yours
