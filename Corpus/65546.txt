 URL : "https://github.com/silexlabs/Silex/issues/622" TITLE : issue with editing site BODY : hey, wondering if anyone can help me with this hopefully easy issue. i published my site last night and realized i forgot to enable mobile; so i went back in, enabled mobile and re-published. now, i went to add a photo, but cannot edit anything except for moving via the arrow keys on my keyboard and when the site opens it will only open to one page despite the links directing to the other pages eg. about displays the home page information . thankfully i had a backup of the good site minus mobile optimization saved to revert back to on my own domain, but i cannot edit this site through silex even after disabling mobile view. hopefully i explained that so it's easy to be understood.
