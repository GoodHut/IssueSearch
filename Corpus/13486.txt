 URL : "https://github.com/Tufin/pytos/issues/7" TITLE : usage of inotify BODY : you are using inotify for some log handling actions. however, inotify is not available on macos, it is linux only. i would like to use pytos directly on my workstation for some presentations and basic development. is it possible to replace inotify as a dependency and replace it with something that is available on more platforms? best regards, paul
