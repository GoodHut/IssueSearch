 URL : "https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/4094" TITLE : webpack 2 and csp BODY : hey, it seems that webpack 2 uses the eval method when building on dev-mode. eval causes a csp content security violation violation. this is no showstopper for us, but it's really disturbing while developing, because we will start ignoring the csp violations caused by the webpack dev mode and overlook real csp violations in the development phase.
