 URL : "https://github.com/maybelinot/df2gspread/issues/26" TITLE : updating data is slow BODY : looks like it can take up to a few minutes for each call to df2gspread.upload. any reason that might be inefficient, or using an older version of the api? for a longer script that updates a few thousand cells it can take up to 10 minutes
