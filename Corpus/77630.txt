 URL : "https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-ecs-nodejs-microservices/issues/5" TITLE : no router for /api/posts BODY : navigating to /api/posts fails since there is no router configured for it in server.js this is as compared to /api/users and /api/threads which return all users and all threads respectively. additionally, the tutorial actually recommends testing api and posts services using that url. the fix is easy...add this to ./3-microservices/services/server.js and /2-containerized/services/api/server.js node router.get '/api/posts', function { this.body = db.posts; } ; i have done this in a fork as well as correcting a spelling error .
