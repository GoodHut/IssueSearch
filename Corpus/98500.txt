 URL : "https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/issues/365" TITLE : is entities really needed? BODY : we started looking at upgrading discourse to markdown.it at the moment i am in the middle of adding an experimental switch for it. during my work i was trying to figure out why markdown.it is so much bigger than our previous md library. one thing that stuck out is https://github.com/fb55/entities/blob/master/maps/entities.json which is 39k. is this dependency really required? should it be an opt in thing to keep the bundles small by default?
