 URL : "https://github.com/chemheritage/chf-sufia/issues/541" TITLE : solr deploy error BODY : another fun issue, when deploying out solr setup to a fresh box we run into an error when it tries to create the default admin setup. it looks like the simplest fix is to restart solr between deploying the solrconfix.xml and the admin set creation, as restarting solr and redeploying causes it to work fine. see the full error here: https://gist.github.com/sanfordd/cf966c1c9bdea0c10f95019ded668216
