 URL : "https://github.com/UTRS/utrs/issues/140" TITLE : detecting global blocks BODY : right now users with accounts affected by a global rangeblock of the underlying ip try to appeal via utrs and get told by the tool that they are not blocked , which is not accurate information. either we should allow them through they can be declined/deferred to meta by responders , or at least there should be an error message explaining the nature of the global block with a link to meta or something. we've had two cases in the past months that have ended up contacting the mailing list and which i've responded to via e-mail one result in a vulgar tirade and mailing list ban, the other in a successful ipbe request .
