 URL : "https://github.com/Alanaktion/alanaktion.github.io/issues/2" TITLE : post title color BODY : since merging my new zilla style, there's an issue where the post titles are using the post content heading foreground colors, but still applying the black background to the h1 . this looks particularly bad since the navbar and the date subheading are both using the main brand color. i may need to just use a different primary color for the whole site that doesn't need contextual adjustments to fix contrast like i'm doing now.
