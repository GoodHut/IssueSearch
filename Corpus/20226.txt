 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/issues/1232" TITLE : c eval gpu support BODY : hi. i want to use a custom trained rcnn model in a webservice. even if the cnn model works as intended, the performance of the model in c is slow with 3000-4000 roi's on a cpu. it takes roughly 12-13 seconds + time to generate the regions of interest. to accommodate the issue, i will buy a server with two dedicated high end gpu's. however, the latest patch notes states that the c evaluation supports cpu only, and not gpu execution. when will the c evalution support gpu evalution? should i order the server now, or is gpu evulation not a current priority? best regards morten
