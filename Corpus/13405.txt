 URL : "https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga/issues/1018" TITLE : uncaught at saga BODY : hey i get this error and don't know how to better debug or what the problem is. i tried different redux-saga versions but the problem still persists. i'm pretty sure i did not have this problem more than 1-2 weeks ago. i also tried to check out older git commits, but the problem still exists. it's also interesting that i can login so loginsuccess/loginfail actions get dispatched. so the app is working ayway, i just get those strange errors. ! screenshot_20170606-174157 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4509289/26868351-08059ef2-4b69-11e7-82f8-524e63fd07f9.png i don't even know what i've changed from the first error to the second, but i think just another redux-saga version. ! screenshot_20170606-175825 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4509289/26868357-0d2c93e0-4b69-11e7-9e51-f741262ace1e.png strange is also that in reactotron the saga/effect s is undefined ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4509289/26868784-6f9948f6-4b6a-11e7-9eb0-d27316de73fb.png
