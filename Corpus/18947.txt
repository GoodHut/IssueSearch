 URL : "https://github.com/archiecobbs/jsimpledb/issues/14" TITLE : vaadin gui update BODY : this isn't an issue per say, but after setting up the gui editor for a schema i wrote, i realized i was no longer able to edit objects with a set, since the jset/jmap/jlist field builders in jobjecteditorwindow.java are still a todo and result in an invalid value s message. though technically not needed, i'd really love to use the editor. any recommendation to get past this in the meantime? alternatively, i'm thinking i could hold myself over by writing a very simple implementation of the field builders a text field of json to represent the set/map/list of either internal ids or simple data
