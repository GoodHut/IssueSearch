 URL : "https://github.com/aexmachina/factory-girl/issues/104" TITLE : new adapter + babel setup BODY : hi, i'm working on an adapter for objection.js and ran into the following error when attempting to run tests for it: objectionadapter build builds the model: typeerror: class constructor model cannot be invoked without 'new' at new dummyobjectionmodel test/test-helper/dummyobjectionmodel.js:32:145 looking at the objection repo, they claim it has something to do with the babel setup https://github.com/vincit/objection.js/issues/388 . do you have any thoughts on what would need to be changed to make things work with the current factory girl setup? i'm a complete newb with regards to babel, so was hoping you might have some advice. thanks!
