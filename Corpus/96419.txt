 URL : "https://github.com/Door43/ulb-en/issues/592" TITLE : est 1:2 fortress or palace BODY : a reviewer linked several chunks back to this one telling mtt's to translate the word palace the same way they did in 1:2. but, the word palace does not appear here. it says fortress. i'm not sure if the text was changed at some point, but in researching this i noticed that the hebrew word birah is translated as fortress only twice 1:2 and 9:6 in the ulb. everywhere else it is translated as palace. it looks like most english versions translate it as fortress or citadel. before i change the notes i wanted to see if you wanted to change 1:2 and 9:6 to palace, or all the others to fortress, or just leave them as is.
