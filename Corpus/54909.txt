 URL : "https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResources/issues/278" TITLE : hqrm plaster templates BODY : i'm creating a couple of hqrm plaster templates here . https://github.com/bgelens/newdschighqualityresourcemodule i'm planning to have these merged into the plaster github.com/powershell/plaster/ repo eventually. since plaster is shipped together with the powershell vs code extension, this will bring hqrm module and hq resource scaffolding as an easy wizard driven experience. help is welcomed!
