 URL : "https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/issues/4850" TITLE : bug in xml file BODY : i've got the following snippet of xml page definition <gridlayout columns= 12,32,40, ,auto rows= 1,5,auto,auto,auto > <label class= separator row= 0 col= 0 colspan= 5 /> </gridlayout> the width is being set to 12 - when in actually since this label spans 5 columns - it should be the sum of all the columns. used to work as expected in ns 2.x but not in ns 3.2
