 URL : "https://github.com/chylex/TweetDuck/issues/137" TITLE : ram usage concerns BODY : browser window - reduce usage in the browser window as far as i can tell, enabling --js-flags= --expose-gc in cef and then calling gc ; location.reload ; reliably cleans up memory used by the browser. problem 1: current implementation of cef argument loading overwrites user arguments with custom ones; use may want to add their own --js-flags argument which has to be appended instead of replacing it problem 2: reloading the browser window may cause notifications to be lost until show startup notifications is implemented problem 3: browser state will be lost problem 4: the procedure may use more ram for a short amount of time, and reloading uses lots of cpu and hdd the browser should run the cleanup procedure if all conditions are fulfilled: the process' ram usage reaches a minimum threshold customizable in the advanced tab either the window is not visible winapi iswindowvisible , or there was no user activity for a set amount of time tweetdeck is in default state all columns scrolled to top, no tweet/reply textarea, no modals opened no notifications in the past minute? notification window - reduce usage in the notification window the notification window shouldn't use more than ~20 mb, but it might be worth deactivating the formnotification browser when there haven't been any notifications for maybe a minute if that is even possible without destroying the entire window .
