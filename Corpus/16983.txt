 URL : "https://github.com/rroemhild/docker-ejabberd/issues/123" TITLE : more version tags BODY : hi, would be nice if you could adopt the official-docker-image version tag variant and add some more tags: major: ie 16 points to latest 16.x.x-r minor: ie 16.1 points to latest 16.1.x-r so i can safely update your image automated, reboot, recovery, etc and do not have to fear about breaking changes in latest or check for new tags continuously.
