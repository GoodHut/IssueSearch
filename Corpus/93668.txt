 URL : "https://github.com/evandrocoan/MultiModServer/issues/78" TITLE : alternate starting of vote BODY : hello, could you implement an option to have the starting of the vote for maps at the start of the next round after an amount of minutes that can be configured by a cvar. this is similar as the plugin was working before. so lets say you choose 5 minutes and the vote would go at the start of the next round after 5 minutes until map end. hope i explained it well : right now you can choose the vote to start in the ultima/penultima/antepenultima round but the time of one round ending depends between fy or de maps and you can't know when the vote would start. thank you
