 URL : "https://github.com/zendesk/samson/issues/2094" TITLE : word 'deleted' in links BODY : i mistakenly delete a project but thanks to soft_deletion gem, i was able to bring it back. everything is working like before except urls, they are now https://samson.com/my_project/stages/docker-build-deleted-1497513932 deleted part is not optional. links don't work without it. could it be removed?
