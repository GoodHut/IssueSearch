 URL : "https://github.com/cbsd/cbsd/issues/128" TITLE : no issue, just thanks BODY : i could send this in an email, but that just doesn't seem enough... everytime i mess with cbsd, the more freaking awesome i realize it is... i know you mentioned a couple years ago that you were surprised that other people were using it, since you built it for your own personal use; but damn dude... you're doing an excellent job in developing this tool and i just want to stop for a moment and say thank you for putting your time and effort into this project. it has made my life so much easier in setting up my freebsd environments, test playgrounds and such... i wish i was in a bit better of a position financially, i would donate monthly without a second thought. please keep up the good work and once more, thank you for the passion you put into this project.
