 URL : "https://github.com/SpaceTime-IoT/vonnegut/issues/100" TITLE : add operational tooling BODY : it'd be nice to add a module that can be accessed from the console or an external cli program that can do simple operational things. current ideas: - delete topic - describe topic - restart topic - lists running topics - regenerate topic index - freeze topic data and move it aside so ingest can continue and old data can be recovered manually - validate topic data files
