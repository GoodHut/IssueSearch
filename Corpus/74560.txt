 URL : "https://github.com/mathnet/mathnet-spatial/issues/58" TITLE : expanding plane geometry BODY : hi, i would like to expand mathnet-spatial to include more aspects of plane geometry 2d . in particular adding support for different types of lines and shapes and make it a first class feature of the library. since its a structural change to the library i thought it more polite to run it by you before sending a pull request to this end i propose a few alterations to the namespace structure to create euclidean -> planegeometry -> shapes -> lines into shapes the idea is to progressively add various common shape constructs ellipses, rectangles, triangles, etc . into lines would go support for various curve types parabola, hyperbola, etc. a few breaking changes would be required such as renaming line2d to linesegment to avoid confusion with the geometric definition of a line and moving existing 2d constructs into the new namespaces. perhaps it is easier to explain by showing what i suggest to change - https://github.com/aquentin2033/mathnet-spatial/commit/c8a0b0f483d51285386320c891491945d789d8c9 url anyway would that work as a direction for you?
