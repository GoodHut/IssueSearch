 URL : "https://github.com/frank06/ember-data-save-relationships/issues/23" TITLE : maintenance and releases BODY : @frank06 i noticed a commit 3 days ago about maintenance. i think this is a pretty ground-breaking stuff and i will definitely use it in production. it's a band-aid we need until the jaon-api 1.1 spec gets settled, released and both front-end and backend tech catches up. i am willing to take this over, and do the grunt work of code review and release management.
