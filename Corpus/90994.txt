 URL : "https://github.com/ac000/libctemplate/issues/1" TITLE : support for other output. BODY : i have need to send output over ssl and i'd imagine there are other reasons to want the output not sent to a fd. i think i can make the necessary changes, i just wonder which branch i should base my changes from? my thoughts are to implement a lower level interface alongside tmpl_write where there would be an opportunity to define callbacks for the output of an ascii string and the raising of an error enum with a function to resolve the enumeration to a string.
