 URL : "https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa/issues/627" TITLE : 502 internal server error BODY : <!--- provide a general summary of the issue in the title above --> with a basic hello world flask application, i am getting a 502 response from the api gateway with a simple zappa deploy dev testing environment. <!--- provide a more detailed introduction to the issue itself, and why you consider it to be a bug --> based on the documentation, i should already be up and running with a simple zappa init and a zappa deploy dev , but i haven't been able to get close. once i finally got the basic permissions setup for my user account, i was finally able to deploy the application, but now i am getting errors when testing the endpoint. <!--- also, please make sure that you are running zappa _from a virtual environment_ and are using python 2.7 --> here is my zappa settings file: { dev : { app_function : test.app , s3_bucket : zappa-xxxxxx } } and here is the flask program test.py i am attempting to run: from flask import flask app = flask __name__ @app.route / def hello : return hello world! if __name__ == __main__ : app.run when i hit the endpoint, i would expect to see hello world! , but instead i get an internal server error message. here are some more details about the error i retrieved from the aws console: wed jan 25 14:37:16 utc 2017 : execution failed due to configuration error: malformed lambda proxy response wed jan 25 14:37:16 utc 2017 : method completed with status: 502 i assumed this should just work out of the box, but it looks like it does not. have i configured something wrong? do i need additional permissions in order to hit the api? environment configuration: python --version = python 2.7.9 zappa --version = 0.32.1
