 URL : "https://github.com/linuxmint/mdm/issues/197" TITLE : need debug documentation BODY : i am trying to debug a problem with cinnamon on a linux mint system. cinnamon crashes and runs in fallback mode no matter how many times i restart it. information logged gives no guidance to fixing it. i have found that there is a --debug option to cinnamon-session, but i have been unable to determine how to have mdm add this option to the session when it starts cinnamon. any pointers appreciated. this problem is on a system that was running cinnamon fine for the last few years, so this is a mystery.
