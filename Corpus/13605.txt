BODY : why do multi colour prints pause occasionally with the prompt on the lcd that says wait for user.... tried to do a multi color print last night and the print head stayed parked over the priming tower for hours on end. i tried to resume the print in the morning but the nozzle had melted the prime tower after being parked.
