 URL : "https://github.com/ctimmerm/axios-mock-adapter/issues/33" TITLE : inspecting request body? BODY : i am looking for a way to verify that the json in my request is structured properly for the api on the server. i don't want to match routes or methods against certain request parameters. is the only way to inspect the request data via the config.data property in the .reply method? for example, i'm doing something like this now: mock.onpost .reply {data} => { expect data.items.length .not.tobe 0 ; expect data.title .tobe my test title ; // etc... done ; } ; but using .reply for this seems somewhat counterintuitive and i'm wondering if i'm missing something.
