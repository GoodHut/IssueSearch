 URL : "https://github.com/PHPOffice/PHPWord/issues/1113" TITLE : let line support linestyle BODY : i want to add a line in header, but i found it did not support linestyle thickthin .lately i learn the shape from sample, it can support the linestyle .but i disapoint that it can not set postition. whatever i change the points , it always begin from the left side of page. so i wish the line can support linestyle . then i add code in phpword\writer\word2007\style\line.php line 68: $xmlwriter->writeattributeif $style->getline !== null, 'linestyle', $style->getline ; and i copy code from phpword\style\outline.php and paste to phpword\style\line.php const line_single = 'single'; const line_thin_thin = 'thinthin'; const line_thin_thick = 'thinthick'; const line_thick_thin = 'thickthin'; const line_thick_between_thin = 'thickbetweenthin'; private $line; public function getline { return $this->line; } public function setline $value = null { $enum = array self::line_single, self::line_thin_thin, self::line_thin_thick, self::line_thick_thin, self::line_thick_between_thin ; $this->line = $this->setenumval $value, $enum, null ; return $this; } i wish someone would have a better way to do this.
