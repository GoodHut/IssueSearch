 URL : "https://github.com/hidroh/cucumber-api/issues/16" TITLE : default header values BODY : headers a reset after each request, which makes sense, but in most api calls header values are always the same like a basic auth header or content type . it would significantly dry up tests to allow for default headers to get set that bypass the need to say i send and accept json and other header settings.
