 URL : "https://github.com/Chat-Wane/LSEQTree/issues/13" TITLE : a few questions... BODY : i'm somewhat new to cdrt's, and i was hoping you could give me an insight into how to use this library. 1. is the unique identifier used for .applyinsert the same as the one inside the couple created by the remote .insert ? or should it be generated in some other way? var lseq = require lseqtree var a = new lseq 0 var b = new lseq 1 var ei = a.insert 'a', 0 var index = b.applyinsert ei._e, ei._i // <-- correct? 2. am i correct in assuming the index returned by .applyinsert is incremented by 1 because the begin leaf is always at index 0? the above example sets index to 1 , even though intuition would have 'a' be inserted at index 0. 3. how do i create a human-readable text document from the tree? in the other direction, is there a more efficient way to generate a tree from an existing document than just doing insert for every character? thanks for your patience, looking forward to any advice you can provide.
