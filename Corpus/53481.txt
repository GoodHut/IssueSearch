 URL : "https://github.com/azavea/raster-foundry/issues/1993" TITLE : dropbox callback fails BODY : it still is not possible to configure dropbox from the frontend for a user. i tested this out on staging and the server returns an error. the server error seems to be triggered by the url encoding of the pipe character, but even fixing that doesn't result in a properly saved credential. for instance, the following url in a curl request fails: https://app.staging.rasterfoundry.com/api/users/dropbox-setup?userid=google-oauth2%7104543305954860658592 however, if i replace the userid with the pipe in a curl request it works, but dropbox credentials are still not persisted in the database: google-oauth2|104543305954860658592
