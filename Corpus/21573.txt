 URL : "https://github.com/rubyforgood/playtime/issues/157" TITLE : flesh out db seeds BODY : our seeds are a little sparse for a realistic view of the application. let's fill them out a bit! here are some things i'm looking for in this issue: another wishlist or two here's their list of shelter locations https://www.playtimeproject.org/locations/ maybe 20 or 30 items distributed between the wishlists. some items should be on multiple wishlists. this'll be the most time-consuming part because you'll have to find item details on amazon. users! more specifically: let's remove the real information from the seeds and make something up instead. i like astronauts and literary characters, but anything works. every wishlist should have a site manager we should have at least a few users making owned pledges pledges, a mix of anonymous and owned pledges
