 URL : "https://github.com/akirby22/OwlbearGame/issues/6" TITLE : health sprites dan BODY : we may be able to find some free sprites, but if not these are the sprites we need - heart, will be collectibles that increase owlbear's health if he's injured - health gauge, i'm picturing something similar to zelda with a max amount of 3 hearts. we need sprites for each level of health, which we will switch upon owlbear taking damage
