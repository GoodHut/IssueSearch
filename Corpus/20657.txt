 URL : "https://github.com/plasticrake/hs100-api/issues/17" TITLE : crashes after ~12h BODY : using the script for: https://github.com/dersimn/hs100tomqtt causes my mac mini to crash after about 12h, when polling every second. no connections to the machine work after that, probably because all ports are kinda used up to open new connections or still in some reserved state . this might occur just on my machine anyway, but probably you could consider to leave the socket connection open for each device and re-use it for communication. currently you're opening a tcp socket connection, make a request and close it immediately after. my suggestion would be to implement an idle timer that is reset on every message send/receive, if no message occours for a given time maybe around ~2mins the socket connection will be closed.
