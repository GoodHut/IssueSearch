 URL : "https://github.com/RaniSputnik/Flox-GML/issues/9" TITLE : queries not working? BODY : i've been trying to get queries working for a while and can't seem to fix my issues. this is my query code: flox_query_begin player ; flox_query_where ownerid == ? , flox_entity_get player, id ; flox_query_find scr_query_complete, scr_query_error ; of cource there is no point to quering player entity by id but this just to make sure the entity really exists. as far as i know the index ownerid always exists so that should not be a problem either. error: flox: response { http_status : 400.000000, response_headers : 17.000000, id : 1.000000, url : https:\/\/www.flox.cc\/api\/games\/7t2dhdya3xr9njh9\/entities\/player , status : 0.000000, result : {\ message\ :\ a required index is missing: make sure that an index in the form of \\u0027ownerid\\u0027 exists.\ } } flox: { offset :0, limit :8, where : ownerid == whbx5gph9abpzboa } flox: processing response for path = entities/player flox: request was not successful, error = a required index is missing: make sure that an index in the form of 'ownerid' exists. pause event has been registered for this frame pause event has been unregistered i have no idea what i am doing wrong because this should be so simple. it can't find the index no matter what it is/what the entity type is i can always find what i'm searching for from flox website . thanks -igno
