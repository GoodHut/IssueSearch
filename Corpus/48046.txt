 URL : "https://github.com/timauton/Hue/issues/3" TITLE : refresh of x y values BODY : there is currently no code to turn the hue's xy values into the rgb values for the hue controls, so those values are not updated from the hue bridge into zway when a refresh occurs. this will need to go in the hue.prototype.fromxy function and the refresh logic adding to hue.prototype.refreshhuelight.
