 URL : "https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/issues/365" TITLE : no signal on gpio pins BODY : hello, thanks for making this library! we're trying to use it to drive several 32x64 matrices, but they aren't lighting up at all. we've tested the matrices with an arduino mega, and they work fine, so we suspect there something wrong with our adapter board the active 3 or how we're using the library. i manually checked all the gpio pins on two different pis running demo -d 0, but didn't see a signal on any of the pins going to the panels. i'm new to gpio on the raspberry pi, so do you have any advice on what may be wrong? should i even expect to see a signal? is there a global setting i'm missing somewhere? thanks!
