 URL : "https://github.com/yyss8/scBlog/issues/3" TITLE : no image upload BODY : having further developed your blog into a cms with categories, tags, seo-friendly urls and more fields i've bumped into what seems to be one last hurdle: images won't upload. have tested both .png and .jpg - and on both windows and ubuntu but same result. the image name is displayed, and it's also possible to preview it. but a click in the red upload-button seems to initiate nothing. and after save, nothing has happened. please don't bother, if it's not supposed to work. then i'll manage without.
