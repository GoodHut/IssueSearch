 URL : "https://github.com/rkt/rkt/issues/3772" TITLE : image gc improvement BODY : currently i'm in a situation when i have several rkt images stored on disk with the same name. it can be that i will have 10,15 rkt images which consume disk space and gc operations will not clean them. that's why i would like to consult if this situation it expected? because i would like to improve image gc operation that it will store only n images with the same name and prepare pull request. so the question is this feature should be implemented or am i doing something wrong?
