 URL : "https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-jui/issues/73" TITLE : spinner buttons invisible BODY : after this update, the up/down buttons of the spinner widget will be unvisible. the buttons are there and they work, but they're just not visible. to reproduce, just have a page with a spinner widget on it, and upgrade yii2-jui to version 2.0.7. the issue is the result of a subtle conflict between jquery-ui.js 1.12.x and bootstrap.js . it is explained in detail here https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/6094 issuecomment-11148540 . as a workaround, make juiasset load version 1.11.4 of jquery-ui in stead of version 1.12.1 for instance via the assetmanager app-component . yii version 2.0.13 php version 7.1.7 windows 10 but it will apply to other versions as well
