 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/issues/289" TITLE : cannot create websocket BODY : the main symptom is when i pass true to the directline websocket param and it attempts to create the websocket the operation fails. after some shallow digging i discovered the streamurl returned when creating a conversation is essentially just the path and it missing the protocol ws:// and the domain bits. i monkeyed with the code a bit to create the proper string with protocol and domain and the websocket creation succeeds, but this seems like a bug or i am missing something in my environment causing this...
