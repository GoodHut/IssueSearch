 URL : "https://github.com/XZES40/XZES40-Transformer/issues/24" TITLE : only cache stylesheets BODY : @shathaway @todopen @zixunlu please comment in our meeting last week with steven it became apparent that the only documents which are regularly reused are stylesheets. if use use this to our advantage, we can create a document transformer which only caches stylesheets. this saves us development time trying to cache all objects. thoughts? if we implement this we need to start refactoring the code soon.
