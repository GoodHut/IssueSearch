 URL : "https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/3582" TITLE : asset paths in css BODY : readme says: > webpack finds all relative module references in css they start with ./ and replaces them with the final paths from the compiled bundle. if you make a typo or accidentally delete an important file, you will see a compilation error, just like when you import a non-existent javascript module. the final filenames in the compiled bundle are generated by webpack from content hashes. if the file content changes in the future, webpack will give it a different name in production so you donâ€™t need to worry about long-term caching of assets. but what should i do if the assets are not located in the same directory as the css files? all my assets are in src/assets/... , but css files can be in other folders as well. neither ./assets/... nor ../assets/... seems to work.
