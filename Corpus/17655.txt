 URL : "https://github.com/dotnet/vblang/issues/223" TITLE : ranged data types BODY : i suggest to improve current numeric types by adding a way to set a value range. this can be done by some attributes, but it will be easier to give it a syntax like this dim i as integer 5,10 or dim i as integer<5,10> the compiler must not allow i to have any value < 5 or >10. one can omit one limit: dim i as integer ,100 dim i as integer 13, or dim i as integer <,100> dim i as integer <13,> this will make it easy to write auto-properties like this: property age as integer 18,30 or property age as integer<18,30> this can be done by adding two readonly properties to each data type: min, max. the compiler should check them before assigning any value to the object. max and min values can also be set via the constructor.
