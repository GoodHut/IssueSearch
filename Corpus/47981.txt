 URL : "https://github.com/xivdb/api/issues/9" TITLE : recipe depth limited? BODY : taking as example this resource : https://api.xivdb.com/recipe/32431 here is a basic recipe tree we can create from the recipe ingame: wind-up susano 1x worsted yarn ... 2x dawn serge 3x worsted yarn ... 1x kyanite ... problem is that the first worsted yarn in the recipe root has a synths attribute because it's a pre-requisite craft made by wvr but the second time we see it in the tree of dawn serge it has no synths attribute, meaning that if we want to base a parser on this, it's impossible because if it has no synths, it's supposed to be a non-craftable item but it is. is this a bug or is it by design? if it's by design, how to know for sure if an item is craftable in a recipe tree?
