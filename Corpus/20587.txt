 URL : "https://github.com/twilio/voice-quickstart-server-python/issues/11" TITLE : configure for voip BODY : i am currently working with this quickstart along with the voice-quickstart-swift quickstart. my end goal is to implement voip calling. my question is how would i configure this server to connect a voip call between two clients? i believe i am following the swift quickstart about as completely as i can and have made sure to use the portion of the quick start that is related directly with voip. as far as i can tell it's working, but when i place a call i get the stock congratulations! you have made your first oubound call! good bye. . due to this i believe there is something i need todo within the outgoing method, but not sure what todo in order to connect two clients via voip. i have tried the twilml call command, but this seems to generate an actual phone call to a user's phone number. what i'm looking for is a way to perform a voip call that would then utilize apple's voip push notification to alert the user of an incoming call. any help here would be greatly appreciated. i appreciate that this is sort of a combination between two quickstarts, but right now i think the server is the side that needs to be updated. thanks!
