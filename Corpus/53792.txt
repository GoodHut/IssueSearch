 URL : "https://github.com/n4kz/react-native-material-textfield/issues/37" TITLE : errors not being shown BODY : i have been trying to augment the example code to pull it into my application. currently everything is working with the exception of the error messages not being generated. i can pause the debugger before the render method returns and guarantee that my error object has the appropriate error messages contained within it. more than that, if i hard-code an error message onto the textfield component, it does not render at all. i can include my code if you would like to take a look at it. i am currently running rn 0.46.1
