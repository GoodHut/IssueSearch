 URL : "https://github.com/Robbendebiene/Gesturefy/issues/125" TITLE : copy link to clipboad BODY : a good replacement for firegesture however there is one option that i really miss. would it be possible to add 'copy link location to clipboard' to the range of gesture options? i used this feature in firegesture instead of having to right click on a link and clicking 'copy link location'.
