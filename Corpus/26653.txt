 URL : "https://github.com/bdew/generators/issues/130" TITLE : bug syngas producer BODY : not sure if this is a bug but it certainly was painful tonight. apparently the syngas generator will take darn near any item you feed it. you get nothing for them if they have no carbon value of course. it ate my bag of holding from eu2 complete with most of my gear. is that intended functionality or should it only take fuel items with carbon values? i'm going to go cry now.
