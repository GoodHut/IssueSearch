 URL : "https://github.com/WebAssembly/threads/issues/10" TITLE : how to test? BODY : we rely on the spec conformance test suite to help ensure consistent behavior across webassembly implementations. how should we test the behavior of the atomic operations? the ecmascript tests https://github.com/tc39/test262/tree/master/test/built-ins are primarily api tests, though there are some that require the harness to provide a mechanism for spawning new threads and sending messages between them. what tests will we want for webassembly?
