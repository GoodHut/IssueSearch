 URL : "https://github.com/tastybento/askyblock/issues/441" TITLE : island range problem BODY : it is related with acidisland but acidisland has no issue tracker so im writing here. same codebase anyway. i made an update from 3.0.1 to 3.0.5.1 some of my players lost their island ranges. in my config protection range 100 and island range 110. former players can use all 100 blocks but now they can only use 94. so their blocks stayed outside and levels dropped. what should i do?
