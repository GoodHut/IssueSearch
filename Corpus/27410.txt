 URL : "https://github.com/sfsam/Itsycal/issues/44" TITLE : cut-off to next day BODY : would be nice if you can configure a cut-off in which itsycal stops showing today's events, but rather shows tomorrow's events. useful at night for previewing your calendar for tomorrow. also would be nice if there was an option to hide events that have already occurred.
