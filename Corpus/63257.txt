 URL : "https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2/issues/246" TITLE : discuss map save & load BODY : when i needed to save and load maps, i saw many orb-slam2 forks doing it in many ways, some not working, most saving unnecessary data. i went on a deep journey and got a decent working minimum binary file size, avoiding saving a lot of members: some ephemeral, some rebuildable. but i did it on a modified version of orb-slam2, working only on monocular. if someone want to debate and code a neat serialize class for orb-slam2 to share, this is where to start.
