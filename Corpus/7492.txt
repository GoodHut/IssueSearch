 URL : "https://github.com/theochem/gbasis/issues/19" TITLE : gcc 4.8 too old BODY : @tovrstra so we ran into this problem earlier but i never noticed it. the compile fails because the gcc version is too old i think. i'm actually not sure how it even managed to succeed in builds like this https://travis-ci.org/theochem/gbasis/jobs/278420508 . there's gcc 7.2.0 in the anaconda channel https://anaconda.org/anaconda/repo , but it looks like the compiler is only available on linux. libgcc of various versions is available on all systems though in the anaconda channel. i think the reason they don't include the osx compiler is because they want them to use clang which is also available in the anaconda channel . so i guess we're out of options? we should be building our codes with modern c++ requirements on clang for osx and gcc for linux. i don't even know if libint/libxc build successfully in clang. another possibility is that we use the gcc that's included in travis, and include the anaconda libgcc for the corresponding version? that way we don't have to rebuild our _entire_ toolchain... technically though, everything we install from conda is already using clang to build, so we're actually doing something bad at the moment...
