 URL : "https://github.com/LarsWesselius/Marvin/issues/10" TITLE : improve banned user check BODY : the banned user check isn't hugely useful right now because it seems to be comparing two strings in a fairly straightforward way is one in the other . this means that if someone joins with the username lol , any other banned user that happens to have lol somewhere in their name is flagged. i'd suggest first only considering usernames with more than ~5 characters. any less than this and we're unlikely to be able to tell whether they're the same person. we could even go as far as requiring the whole username to be the same.
