 URL : "https://github.com/NoImageAvailable/CombatExtended/issues/155" TITLE : sapper raid exception BODY : sapper raids currently throw an exception because none of the spawn groups for pirates contain sapper pawns. those were broken with the changes to grenades, so need to figure out what to do with those. might just disable sappers entirely for now, since with the new ai on the horizon spending lots of time fixing soon-to-be obsolete raid types isn't a good use of time.
