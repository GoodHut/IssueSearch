 URL : "https://github.com/SouthForkResearch/CHaMP-Metric-Generation-R-Scripts/issues/3" TITLE : lw frequency bf/wetted BODY : any thoughts on what i should do if the metric definition on mr.org doesn't match what's actually been implemented to date? specifically, the lw frequency metrics call for the sum of large wood pieces to be divided by site bankfull length. after trail and error i figured out that the metrics on cm.org are actually the number of lw pieces divided by the site wetted length. the difference is generally only a few % at most. i can write the script using wetted length and match match cm.org exactly, or i can follow the documentation exactly and have answers that are up to a few % off of the cm.org data. nahorniak email on 1/23
