 URL : "https://github.com/moebooru/moebooru/issues/83" TITLE : posts api - tag types BODY : the current api, specifically the /post.json endpoint, does not seems to provide any means to know the type of the tags in a post. its not always possible to determine this by the /tags.json endpoint since multiple tags can have the same name but different types. is there any undocumented means to reliably determine the type of a tag from a post, preferably without n+1 queries? if not, i propose an option to have that info on the /post.json endpoint. perhaps a second tag_types array where each item is the type of the corresponding tag in the tags array? this is ugly but keeps the api backwards-compatible. any other means in this same endpoint are fine too.
