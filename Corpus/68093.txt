BODY : for the purposes of quickly iterating age testing and korman feature testing as well it would be extremely useful to have the ability to quickly unload and reload the current age from disk without needing to quit and restart the client. even with an internal client running on localdata, a blank logo video, and setting an avatar and startup age, it can still take quite a bit of time with the initial load.
