 URL : "https://github.com/perseo22/pacmanager/issues/59" TITLE : how to build BODY : does anyone know how to build pac from the git source? @perseo22 isn't very active anymore, so if we would have clear instructions on how to currently build the source code and and how to create the .rpm and .deb packages out of it, we, the community, could make the process more straight forward and possibly help get the project alive again. does anyone already have some infos scrapped together? i don't want to reinvent the wheel on this one.
