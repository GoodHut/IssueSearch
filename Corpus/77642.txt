 URL : "https://github.com/zurb/tribute/issues/78" TITLE : no way to stop ajax call BODY : when using ajax request callback to populate values, the ajax request is sent by adding a new character even after no match. there's no reason to send another request when the previous request with less characters itself returns nothing. also i would like to use the previously populated values instead of making new request again on pressing backspace.
