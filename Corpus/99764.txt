 URL : "https://github.com/pytorch/vision/issues/209" TITLE : new release or use master? BODY : hi, is the recommended way to use vision installing from master? i have a similar issue as 169, which apparently multiple other people have encountered. it seems to be fine in master. the last release is 4 months old. when installing via conda or pip - although pytorch doesn't play nicely with pip , only the released version is installed. also, it will be very helpful if master can be a different version. now since master and the last release are on the same version, upgrading won't work.
