 URL : "https://github.com/cruftlab/random-words/issues/29" TITLE : redesign the whole thing BODY : the entire app is ugly, doesn't work well with mobile, and has old, copied css from the old site. a full redesign is due, and why not go for something like material ui http://material-ui.com/ ? it's probably overkill x2 with the current features, but with more major features in the pipeline, it might not hurt to think ahead.
