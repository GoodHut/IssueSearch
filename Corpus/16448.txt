BODY : when trying to merge two files, i'm getting the following error message: error: cannot parse line 7241 in file json_value_module.f90-no-unicode.gcov is this a valid gcov file? see here https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/pull/251 issuecomment-277583268 for more details. the line in question https://api.travis-ci.org/jobs/198723183/log.txt?deansi=true seems to be: 443233956: 7236: else if any c == control_chars then is it possibly due to the very large integer value for the count 443233956 ? i don't know anything about perl so i didn't see anything obvious in the code.
