 URL : "https://github.com/ITS-UofIowa/sitenow_standard_profile/issues/91" TITLE : add help/support dashboard BODY : add a button in the admin toolbar for users to get help. this should include access to support articles and a form that will create a ticket with the its help desk. access to support articles i am envisioning a page which lists the titles of support articles grouped by category that link to the articles on the its website. ideally we could coordinate with adrienne to create a feed from the its website of support articles per info center which we could consume to generate these lists. form to create a ticket this will need more discussion with the its help desk staff to determine how to implement this. should these tickets be automatically escalated to the sitenow standard/web services team?
