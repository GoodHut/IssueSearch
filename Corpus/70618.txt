BODY : i may be an idiot as i am a newbie, but i have a catastrophic error and a question. the error is when i try to run the command ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml from the playbooks folder i get: downloading role '---', owned by sorry, --- was not found on galaxy.ansible.com. downloading role 'git', owned by -%20src%3a%20geerlingguy sorry, - src: geerlingguy.git was not found on galaxy.ansible.com. downloading role 'mysql', owned by -%20src%3a%20geerlingguy sorry, - src: geerlingguy.mysql was not found on galaxy.ansible.com. downloading role 'nodejs', owned by -%20src%3a%20geerlingguy sorry, - src: geerlingguy.nodejs was not found on galaxy.ansible.com. downloading role 'raspberry-pi', owned by -%20src%3a%20geerlingguy sorry, - src: geerlingguy.raspberry-pi was not found on galaxy.ansible.com. the question is: are vagrant and virtual-box required? i am running multiple raspberrys and don't need to run virtual systems on one box as far as i know. i've got my sensors all wired up and running fine - i'd love to get this software figured out! thank you. steve
