 URL : "https://github.com/audiorouterdev/audio-router/issues/73" TITLE : idea: command line support BODY : e.g. audiorouter assign <process-name.exe> <audio-device > this could then open up audio routing to be used in automation much easier. e.g. assigning audio device automatically based on which monitor a program is open on, just detect which monitor program is open on and then send a command o assign <process> <audio device of choice>
