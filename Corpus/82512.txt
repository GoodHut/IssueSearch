 URL : "https://github.com/leovo2708/ngx-treeview/issues/4" TITLE : additional config options BODY : it would be nice to see a full list of supported config options and it would be great to have the ability to make this a single select instead of multi along with the ability to define what the structure of my data looks like. ex using nodes or leafs instead of children as the nested categories.
