 URL : "https://github.com/greg7mdp/sparsepp/issues/22" TITLE : trivial compiler warnings BODY : compiling with -wall and -wdouble-promotion on gcc 6.1 yields the following trivial warnings: sparsepp.h: in member function ‘void spp::sparsehash_internal::sh_hashtable_settings<key, hashfunc, sizetype, ht_min_buckets>::set_resizing_parameters float, float ’: sparsepp.h:1522:27: warning: implicit conversion from ‘float’ to ‘double’ to match other operand of binary expression -wdouble-promotion assert shrink >= 0.0 ; ~~~~~~~^~~~ sparsepp.h:1523:25: warning: implicit conversion from ‘float’ to ‘double’ to match other operand of binary expression -wdouble-promotion assert grow <= 1.0 ; ~~~~~^~~~ it is obviously inconsequential, but maybe worth fixing just to get clean compile time messages.
