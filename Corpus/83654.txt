 URL : "https://github.com/WPTRT/theme-sniffer/issues/72" TITLE : check for use of site_url BODY : what do you think about a warning for using site_url instead of home_url ? i'm trying to think if a theme would ever need to use site_url , and can't think of any reason. i have encountered several themes that have used site_url for a link to 'home' like on the 404 page , but in a subdirectory install, that is the wrong address. one even used it for the search, which gave me a 404.
