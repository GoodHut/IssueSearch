 URL : "https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/issues/3326" TITLE : remote snapshot creation BODY : hi here is my use case: - i have a remote server with datas i want to periodically backup - i have my storage server which i trust more - i don't trust remote so i don't want to grant access to storage the common way is be to create a snapshot from remote to storage like borg create ssh://storage/mnt/backup.borg::{now} /etc but it gives remote full access to the borg repo, and it could potentially delete it. i would like to backup remote 's data from storage shell like borg create /mnt/backup.borg::{now} ssh://remote/etc which is to me more secure because remote has no access to storage and cannot access to the borg repo. another idea would be to create a special user on remote with a special borg shell like git which would allow only create operations configurable to allow list, extract too? maybe i'm missing something, but is there an alternative here to use borg to backup remotes without giving them full access to the repo? thanks
