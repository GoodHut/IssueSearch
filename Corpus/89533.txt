BODY : hi, great idea collecting these resources for python, thank you. i have a similar repo, dedicated to open source forced aligners not just python : https://github.com/pettarin/forced-alignment-tools and some of them --- including my own aeneas --- are written at least partially in python. so my question is: do you take pull requests? 1. if yes, would you mind creating a forced aligners subsection, or do you prefer filing them under the current speech processing ? 2. if not, would you mind adding those you deem interesting feel free to copy from the list linked above ? btw, you might want to state your contribution policy somewhere in the readme, so that you will not get similar queries later.
