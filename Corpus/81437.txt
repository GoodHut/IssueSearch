BODY : hi tim, how are you? i am getting a wrong count of search where the number of matches is greater than one of actual document present. when i debugged i am getting a sense that following issue might be causing this. thought of confirming with you. if my assumption is correct i will share the query and other details to reproduce it with you as currently i am having only the query and not the test case which can reproduce it.
