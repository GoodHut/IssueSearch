 URL : "https://github.com/sabnzbd/sabnzbd/issues/940" TITLE : issues due to line speed BODY : hi all, i've been using sab for quite some time, internet speed was 300/100, and never any issues. couple weeks ago, i upgraded to gigabit, and issues started with sab. constantly freezing / recovering ect. i've noticed that sab peaks out around 75mb/s which is pretty good considering it is written in python. but as it approaches this number, sab starts freezing/ recovering over and over rather than just having a graceful back down. am i correlating these two things correctly? or is it just a coincidence? thanks!
