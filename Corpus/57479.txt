 URL : "https://github.com/upjs-jf/mdh/issues/3" TITLE : python + root = pyroot BODY : this issue will be dedicated to using,installing and troubles with pyroot. do i have to need install some additionally libraries or set up paths for reading existing libraries ? because i tried examples on https://root.cern.ch/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/pythonruby.html but it doesn't work. maybe this will be useful for all of you and once everyone tried python because in my opinion it is stupidity-protected language :d : i know that @fisopkov is already using it. @mvala promise that he will show us working examples, thank you !
