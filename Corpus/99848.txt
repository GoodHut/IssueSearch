 URL : "https://github.com/FreeRDP/Remmina/issues/1087" TITLE : no move or resize terminal BODY : hi, i can not move or resize the widows of opened terminals using rdp or vnc. i can use the windows minimize, maximize buttons but there's no access to the system menu. basically, once the terminal window is opened i can not move it or resize it, i can just unmaximize or minimize the window. i think this was not the case with previous versions. please give us some details about the systems you are using: client os name and version : xubuntu 16.04 remmina version remmina --version : 1.2.0-rcgit-17 desktop environment gnome, unity, kde, .. : xfce connecting to os and version : all connecting via rdp, vnc, ... : all rdp issues only, freerdp version xfreerdp --version : not installed
