 URL : "https://github.com/Heishe/idleraiders-second-run/issues/522" TITLE : game code crash BODY : i bought the holy warrior merc and necromancer right after and it crashed. this was the raider setup i had right before it, i'm able to replicate it every time with this. also, the holy warrior either is trying to constantly attack something when he isn't moving or his idle animation is bugged after the crash ! ss 2017-03-11 at 02 11 34 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/26186257/23823146/d350bb5e-0664-11e7-9f45-8a6be341f490.png error_report.txt https://github.com/heishe/idleraiders-second-run/files/835720/error_report.txt
