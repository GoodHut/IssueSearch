 URL : "https://github.com/ELIFE-ASU/Neet/issues/83" TITLE : death to generators BODY : generators are great when you may have to iterate over computations that are too large to store in memory. this is certainly a possibility for much of neet's algorithms. it was for this reason that @dglmoore over-engineered neet's functions to yield instead of return where possible. while it may seem like this is a good thing, it is really just cumbersome for users, implementers and maintainers. the problem it aimed to solve is a non-issue as most of the time there are computational limits other memory that come into play around the same time as memory issues. we should refactor to use lists in place of generators unless it makes sense to do otherwise.
