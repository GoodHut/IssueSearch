 URL : "https://github.com/JelteF/derive_more/issues/25" TITLE : list of potential derives BODY : i really like this crate, and would love to see one crate that did _what you would expect_ for std traits. so i was thinking about compiling a list of other potential derives: conversions: - asmut - asref ops: - index , indexmut - deref , derefmut formatting: - display use debug implementation as default - octal , lowerhex , upperhex , binary when the inner types implement these any thought about these? i wouldn't mind hashing out some of the details and even contributing.
