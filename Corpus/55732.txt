 URL : "https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-ios-sdk/issues/202" TITLE : libgvrsdk.a is massive BODY : libgvrsdk.a is 118.5 mb after running pod install . github's file size limit is 100 mb. our team follows cocoapod's recommendation https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html should-i-check-the-pods-directory-into-source-control of checking in the pods directory, so we're not able to upgrade to 1.20.0 with a file of this size. it would be awesome if this could be reduced in some way. thanks!
