 URL : "https://github.com/mjmlio/mjml-app/issues/131" TITLE : add a hide command BODY : would love the ability to have a hide command with keyboard shortcut available in the app menu. i switch between apps or app/desktop often enough that minimizing the app window to move somewhere else becomes pretty burdensome. it be a huge boost to my efficiency. i actually tried to manually add a shortcut for this myself within the os x settings on my mac, but it wouldn't let me make any shortcuts for the mjml app.
