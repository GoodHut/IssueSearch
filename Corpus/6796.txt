 URL : "https://github.com/JohanDegraeve/iosxdripreader/issues/12" TITLE : can't find icon BODY : on my iphone 7+ with latest ios the icon doesn't show up when i install with itunes. i resigned it with resignipa. now when i try the xcode install method, it says there was an internal api error. i think that means that it is already installed. but i can't find it on the iphone, even with search. did i get into this problem because i tried to install it with itunes first?
