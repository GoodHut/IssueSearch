 URL : "https://github.com/ramonsaraiva/timy/issues/7" TITLE : process_time vs time BODY : hi there. really like this lean approach using decorators. i am wondering though if it wouldn't be better to use time.process_time https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/time.html time.process_time instead of time.time ? or maybe this could be toggled by another decorator function argument like time= total vs time= process or so. what are your thoughts on this?
