 URL : "https://github.com/gatagat/lapjv/issues/3" TITLE : package name confict BODY : would you consider changing the name of this package? it has a naming conflict with this lapjv https://github.com/src-d/lapjv which is pip installable. i have a proof of concept here https://github.com/dribnet/lapjv1 where i have renamed it lapjv1, and it works fine. happy to contribute that or rename it to something else. separately but relatedly, would you consider changing the api to return arguments to this: python rowsol_c, colsol_c, cost = lapjv cost_matrix this would match the api of the other lapjv implementation so that they could be swapped out programatically.
