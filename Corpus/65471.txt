 URL : "https://github.com/nicholas-maltbie/Treachery/issues/37" TITLE : inverse kinematics foot BODY : a nice functionality would be adding inverse kinematics ik to put the feet of a character on the ground. ik is currently implemented in head movement to turn the head where the character is moving. ik will also be implemented for a character to hold items in his/her hand. ik feet will lock the heel of the foot to the ground and hold it in place when the player takes a step and lift the foot when the animation lifts the foot up. additionally, the rest of the foot should run parallel to the ground and the leg should be perpendicular. ik engine can handle manipulating the mesh and overwriting the animation. this can be achieved through use of unity's ik functionality https://docs.unity3d.com/manual/inversekinematics.html and through some complicated code. for an sample, apply this to the missy character in the missyprefab instance assets/models/missy/missyprefab . this is a difficult exercise but would be a very nice aesthetic feature. these this function by having the character walk up stairs and along a curved plain to verify that the function works.
