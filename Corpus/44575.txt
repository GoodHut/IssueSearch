 URL : "https://github.com/compodoc/compodoc/issues/415" TITLE : feature hide accessor BODY : <!-- > please follow the issue template below for bug reports and queries. > for issue, start the label of the title with bug > for feature requests, start the label of the title with feature and explain your use case and ideas clearly below, you can remove sections which are not relevant. --> overview of the issue <!-- explain the issue or feature request, if an error is being thrown a stack trace helps --> it would be nice to have an option to ignore accessors. let's say i have the following accessor: @input 'font.family' protected set setfontfamily family:string { this._fontfamily=family; } since i'd like to developers use only font.family ='something', the accessor shouldn't be documented. only the input should be documented. my suggestion is to implement one of the options below: 1 ignore accessors marked as protected. 2 add an option --disableaccessors 3 or maybe ignore the accessor by using @ignore
