 URL : "https://github.com/tendermint/basecoin/issues/114" TITLE : fix up docs BODY : i removed the example-plugin from the docs dir, as it was buggy and we could just refer to the counter plugin for the same purpose. in doing so, i realized that the docs are now out-of-date. here are some changes we need to publish: basecoin-basics.md : we need to demonstrate using basecli as a client, as in tests/cli/basictx.sh basecoin-plugins.md : we need to update it from example-plugin to counter and countercli ibc.md : all code examples needs a rewrite. using the enhanced sendtx and relay. as tested in tests/cli/ibc.sh no need to manually move the ibc packets from chain to chain. i think these are fine, but maybe there is some text changes needed: basecoin-tool.md install.md anyone wishing to make a pr here is most welcome :
