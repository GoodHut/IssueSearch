BODY : i've spent a couple days trying to use spritekit and i have to say that i hate it. i know that, like countless others, i may be biased coming into ios with a flash background. simple, silly things like there is apparently no way to be notified when an sknode is added/removed from the stage. also, being closed source, i'm worried that i will run up against a deep rooted performance issue and be held at apple's mercy for a fix. i've loved using sparrow and i wish that was smarter and had more time to contribute. @racarone @primaryfeather i know that i'm probably years behind in the discussion here. you all, i'm sure, have talked about this stuff already but... 1. do you think sparrow compatibility will withstand the next two or three ios versions? 2. has anyone done any performance testing lately between spritekit & sparrow? a quick google search leads little results. it feels the same to me. i hate being that guy to ask these types of questions. i know the answer probably is, well, you should help out a little and patch sparrow yourself . honestly guys, i'm just not that smart, especially when it comes to all the crazy gpu rendering. thanks in advance.
