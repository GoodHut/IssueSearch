 URL : "https://github.com/oney/react-native-webrtc/issues/366" TITLE : webrtc can't connect BODY : i'm having a problem starting the webrtc call. sometimes the call simply fails and neither the picture nor the video is transmitted. however, this is something that occurs on some occasions and sometimes does not. is there a problem related to ice and stun server? should i add some kind of specific treatment to try to reconnect? how to detect this type of problem?
