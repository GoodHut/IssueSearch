 URL : "https://github.com/eclipsesource/J2V8/issues/283" TITLE : support for set BODY : as we are noticing our backend serialized sets as model which we then convert to v8objects. standard implementation of v8objectutils does not understand sets. at the moment we copied v8objectutils and adopted it to understand sets including a setwrapper object. we could open this as pr but not sure if this matches with strategy where maintainers of this project would like to go. after all converting set to a list in v8 is discussable decision... one option could be also do to some refactoring that one could decide on how to convert. some people communicated here that they go first through gson and then throw gson serialized model to v8objectutils. this of course has performance implications but could work as well. gson has then typeadapters to json, etc. thoughts?
