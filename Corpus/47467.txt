 URL : "https://github.com/michael-donat/php-vfs/issues/46" TITLE : php 7.1 failing tests BODY : is the project being maintained? i see it hasn't been updated in 2 years. i have just tried using the vfs within a test case, without success. php $fs = new filesystem ; $fs->createstructure 'var' >= 'www' >= 'package.json' => '{}', 'project' => 'vendor' => , , , , ; $this->asserttrue file_exists $fs->path '/var/www/package.json' , filesystem failed! ; i can see from the projects own test cases, the above code should work without a problem. so, i'm guessing it's the php version i'm using php 7.1.5-1+deb.sury.org~xenial+2 . it's a shame since this is the only virtual system which should support symlinks.
