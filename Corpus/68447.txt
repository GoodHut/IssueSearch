BODY : hi, congrats and thanks for sharing this fantastic tool ! do you see any means of tweaking ruler to get its ntlm authentication phase done through an ntlm relay attack tool ? say for instance, using the impacket/ntlmrelayx and the pointing the victim to the ntlmrelayx listener a simple e-mail with a hidden image pointing to ntlmrelayx http listener does the trick , and you can get any outgoing http s request to the target exchange server with ntlm authentication handled/relayed automatically. this would remove the credentials hunting phase. cheers.
