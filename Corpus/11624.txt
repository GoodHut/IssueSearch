 URL : "https://github.com/IndigoBox/indigoBox-Website/issues/8" TITLE : improve 404 page BODY : the current indigobox 404 page http://indigobox.us/404 is unstyled and unprofessional, and i believe is a remnant from an older state of the website. the copy should be updated to be more in line with our brand, including the title, which is currently page not found : . for reference, here are some good examples of 404 pages: - github's delightful 404 page https://github.com/404 - mailchimp's 404 page https://mailchimp.com/404/ in the most basic case, we can do something like carpe's 404 page http://www.carpe.us/404 . it's not gorgeous, but it is good enough for the time being, and is much better than the current indigobox 404 page.
