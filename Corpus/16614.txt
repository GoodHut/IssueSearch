 URL : "https://github.com/hammerandchisel/airhornbot/issues/54" TITLE : lag or not to lag BODY : sometimes after using it, the bot stays in a vocal channel and we cant use it. the bot also seems very laggy, it makes sizzled sounds as if it had connection problem or something like that a !ping command to check the ping between us and the bot could be great
