 URL : "https://github.com/playframework/scalatestplus-play/issues/99" TITLE : routes not loading BODY : based on the examples in the docs, and the tests provided with the scala play starter project, i wrote a couple tests for a new app. unexpectedly, the requests i make in my tests come back as 404s. i'm wondering if there's some special step i need to take to ensure the routes are compiled for tests? here are the tests... maybe i'm missing something obvious: scala import org.scalatestplus.play._ import org.scalatestplus.play.guice.guiceoneapppersuite import play.api.test._ import play.api.test.helpers._ import play.api.libs.json.json class routes extends playspec with guiceoneapppersuite { shotgun routes should { find_one should be able to find onelson in { val req = fakerequest post, /sg/relay/find_one .withjsonbody json.parse { kwargs :{ entity_type : humanuser , filters : login , is , onelson }} val resp = route app, req .get status resp mustbe ok contenttype resp mustbe some application/json contentasjson resp \ id .as int mustbe 948 } } dse routes should { sla vert labels should be able ok in { val req = fakerequest get, /dse/sla/vert-labels val resp = route app, req .get status resp mustbe ok contenttype resp mustbe some application/json contentasstring resp must include asset } } } the requests, as written, should match what i have in my routes file, and the app is working when i push requests to it in practice. post /sg/relay/:methodname controllers.relaycontroller.run methodname: string get /dse/:graph/vert-labels controllers.atlaslegacycontroller.vertlabels graph: string post /dse/:graph/gremlin controllers.atlaslegacycontroller.gremlin graph: string is there something missing? thanks, owen
