 URL : "https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/42" TITLE : picking a language BODY : the current fallback algorithm states that if the language cannot be determined, set it to english. i don't like this approach, as it's a random choice. as stated in bcp 47, if there has to be a language and one cannot be determined, use und undetermined . if we're picking up language codes from wp resources, it would also be good to be clear that a conforming language code is expected, not just a language designation like english .
