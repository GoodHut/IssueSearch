 URL : "https://github.com/CAD97/SpawnerCraft/issues/15" TITLE : craftable mob spawner BODY : i enabled craftable spawners in the config file but it's not letting me craft them. i'm assuming the recipe is 8 iron bars in a crafting table in a chest formation. i also do not see a recipe for it anywhere on the mod website. so either i have the wrong recipe or it's not working.
