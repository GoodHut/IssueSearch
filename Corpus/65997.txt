 URL : "https://github.com/hulop/NavCogIOSv3/issues/35" TITLE : losing users' locations BODY : a user's current location the blue circle with radius disappears when entering certain areas, and the location does not show up even if i shook the phone to force re-localization. it does appear again only if i move to a different location. can we fix this problem? at least, cam we notify users when the localization is not working? such as localization failed due to bad signals .
