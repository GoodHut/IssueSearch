 URL : "https://github.com/Rapptz/cpp-sublime-snippet/issues/11" TITLE : cpp-snippets for vscode BODY : hi, i've ported your cpp-sublime-snippets for vscode editor. i've attributed this repo and stated that the vscode snippets mirrors this repo only. you can see it here - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemname=agauniyal.cpp-snippets. i can even open a pr on this repo which links to vscode extension page. i am not doing any other change to existing snippets so i thought why not keep the same source for multiple editors. if you've any objection to the said vscode plugin, i'll take it down asap otherwise it'll benefit some other users along the way. thank you for your work on cpp-sublime-snippet.
