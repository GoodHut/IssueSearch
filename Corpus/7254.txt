 URL : "https://github.com/conikuvat/edegal/issues/169" TITLE : event meta data BODY : on the conikuvat.fi site, top level albums usually represent one event. we should add the option for basic event meta data for event root albums: event name venue starting and ending dates event logo these events are often managed using the kompassi https://kompassi.eu github project https://github.com/tracon/kompassi event management system, and the basic event information should be imported from there. perhaps just add a kompassi event slug to an album and have other info automatically imported from kompassi api cached, of course . later we could support css customization by event etc.
