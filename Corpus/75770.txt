BODY : hi, just throwing out some ideas on the block registering api. 1. currently block types are created via wp.blocks.registerblock slug, settings which returns the block and also adds the block as a key, value pair to the somewhat global blocks . this is a coupling that i do not think should be made. i would recommend the creation of a block to be handled in a function blocktype slug, settings or preferably just settings . then the registry of blocks can be another factory function that creates registries of blocks, which can have the method registerblock block on them. this will make testing a lot easier/cleaner and will also create a bit more flexibility in the code for unforeseen future needs.
