 URL : "https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/issues/399" TITLE : compiling to pdf? BODY : is there a magic asciidoc or a2x incantation for compiling, either to html or pdf? running asciidoc book.asciidoc produces errors relating to missing files and some other stuff, and a2x -fpdf -dbook book.asciidoc fails completely because xmllint fails to validate, not recognising the <a> tag, for example. i'm running fedora, if that's relevant. thanks again to andreas and o'reilly for making this awesome resource available!
