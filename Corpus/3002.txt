 URL : "https://github.com/nodejs/http2/issues/146" TITLE : h2 frames api BODY : <!-- thank you for reporting an issue. this issue tracker is for bugs and issues found within node.js core. if you require more general support please file an issue on our help repo. https://github.com/nodejs/help please fill in as much of the template below as you're able. version: output of node -v platform: output of uname -a unix , or version and 32 or 64-bit windows subsystem: if known, please specify affected core module name if possible, please provide code that demonstrates the problem, keeping it as simple and free of external dependencies as you are able. --> version : n/a platform : all subsystem : http2 <!-- enter your issue details below this comment. --> there are some interesting proposed http extensions that define new http/2 frames. for example cache_digest http://httpwg.org/http-extensions/cache-digest.html iana-considerations , altsvc http://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-alt-svc.html alt-svc-frame-registration , and origin http://httpwg.org/http-extensions/origin-frame.html iana-considerations . just like http/1 headers are extensible, i would like an api to manage custom frames in the application layer. we currently ignore unrecognised frames emitted by nghttp2 but could bubble them up to the session.
