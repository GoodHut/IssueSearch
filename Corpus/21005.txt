 URL : "https://github.com/anthonynsimon/parrot/issues/38" TITLE : do not enforce ssl BODY : please provide https only optionally, most container-based scenarios are doing ssl termination on an reverse proxy and continue with http to the application. beside that i personally don't generate any certificates on my own anymore, everything is handled by let's encrypt. maybe it's also an option to integrate let's encrypt for the other cases natively, i have already done that for other projects like https://github.com/kleister/kleister-api/blob/master/cmd/server.go l214-l272
