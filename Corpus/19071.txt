 URL : "https://github.com/ro31337/libretaxi/issues/614" TITLE : why phone number? BODY : why do you need users' phone numbers? you say you won't share my info, then, what do you want it for; do you plan to sell it in a future? do you store it anywhere? if so, how can users' ask for removal? also, if i stop the bot will my data be removed from your databases? great bot, libretaxi, but i'm afraid i won't use it until ican complete the configuration process without providing my phone number. regards
