 URL : "https://github.com/adrai/flowchart.js/issues/113" TITLE : line style in flow BODY : i needed to generate a flowchart that would emphasize the path taken by each element. to do this i needed to update the style of each lines dynamically. so i've forked and modified a bit your library to implement a new separator @> to define the flow with each of the specific svg style in json format : st@>op1 { stroke : red } @>cond1 { stroke : red , stroke-width :6, arrow-end : classic-wide-long } @>cond6 { stroke : red } @>op4 { stroke : red } @>end { stroke : red } the idea is to override the line style attribute depending on the destination symbol key with a linestyle object that define a list of style to apply to symbols with symbol key as field for st symbol from the example above linestyle = { op1 : { stroke : red } } example of result ! linestyle https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5183022/29744899-7bc48784-8aae-11e7-94e8-b7e79d17100d.png i've opted to get the line style to be directly parsed in the flowchart format because i didn't manage to get it work with css class. i found this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4522967/how-to-add-a-css-class-to-a-raphael-object but it didn't worked for line style also it seems it won't work everywhere with css class what do you think about this approach ? could this be a relevant pr ?
