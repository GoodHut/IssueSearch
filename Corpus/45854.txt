BODY : sorry for the probably stupid question, but i am trying to learn mqtt. let's say that i have three esp8266s in a mesh using your firmware. 1 is a motion sensor 2 is a water sensor 3 has a rgb led on it is a mqtt broker required for the three of them to talk? i would like when 1 triggers motion, 3 lights the led red, and if 2 detects water, 3 lights the led blue. i have a high level understanding of how this would work with the broker, but is a broker required?
