 URL : "https://github.com/DTasev/imgpy/issues/20" TITLE : easier format specifying BODY : currently what is specified in the --in-format command is _exactly_ what the loader looks for. this is sometimes annoying: - the images might be saved out as .tif , but if you pass --in-format tiff , _no_ images will be found, because the glob patterns looks for exact match for tiff . - the same is valid for .fit and fits images. i don't believe glob has an or statement, so implementing this might be tricky. doing a double look up for the files one with .tif , and if nothing found with .tiff is an easy solution, but not desirable .
