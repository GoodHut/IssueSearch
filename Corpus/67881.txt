 URL : "https://github.com/zetkin/organize.zetk.in/issues/458" TITLE : quick key to close pane BODY : there should be some sort of key or key combination to close the top-most pane. use case: search for person, copy their e-mail adress, search for another person. after a while, there are a lot of panes open. caveats: how do we know which pane to close? closing a pane results in unsubmitted data being unrecoverably lost. this must not happen by accident.
