 URL : "https://github.com/pcaddict08/IPST2/issues/7" TITLE : fix search function BODY : i'm noticing a number of weird behaviors when searching/filtering the portal lists. this list may grow or shrink as i reproduce them better, but i just want to jot things down for now. - when you type in something to search, the list updates correctly, but when you click on any portal from the filtered list, it displays the wrong portal--it looks like it displays the portal from the original, unfiltered list. - if you type in something that should return zero results, like zzzzzz , the list doesn't refresh correctly. ex: z will display razzoo's , baccus plaza , and spring creek gazebo ; zz will further narrow it down to only razzoo's ; but then zzz will continue showing razzoo's , instead of an empty list. - maybe more...
