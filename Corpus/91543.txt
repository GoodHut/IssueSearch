 URL : "https://github.com/dlenski/openconnect/issues/67" TITLE : two factor authentication BODY : my vpn connection works with two factor authentication: first an initial password is given, then a combination of a personal pin and a time-sensitive authentication token must be supplied. neither my password or the pin+token combination were accepted by openconnection . support for this type of authentication would be great. thanks!
