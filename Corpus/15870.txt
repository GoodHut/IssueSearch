 URL : "https://github.com/tx10indivisible/tx10indivisible.github.io/issues/22" TITLE : front page banner BODY : cleaning out tasks there were in my backlog queue. there is an updated banner image in the tx10indivisible-graphics repo tx-10 borderless.png that was contributed for the front page, to replace the current <h1> text title. when this is done it would be super good to include alt text to be screen reader friendly. this is addition to the logo that's already in the page header.
