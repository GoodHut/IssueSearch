 URL : "https://github.com/hellowin/github-clear-merged-pull-requests/issues/1" TITLE : interactive & dry run mode BODY : rather than directly deleting all repo, can you add a flag to: 1. dry run: shows all merged branches, that will be deleted without actually deleting them. 2. interactive delete: instead of automatically delete, show a prompt to user that shows the branch - and y/n prompt. this may not feasible for repo with many branches though.
