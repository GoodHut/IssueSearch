 URL : "https://github.com/Matterwiki/Matterwiki/issues/35" TITLE : switch bcrypt to bcryptjs BODY : i develop on windows and i've had problems with bcrypt pretty much every time it's used, can't even install it properly. there's a library that is from what i've seen a drop-in replacement with zero dependencies bcrypt has gigs of them for windows users and then even those don't work properly . after a bit of frustration with trying to use bcrypt yet again, i decided to just uninstall it from my matterwiki installation, replaced it with bcryptjs, changed the 3 requires and it's working now. just thought i'd leave it as a suggestion. bcrypt.js https://github.com/dcodeio/bcrypt.js
