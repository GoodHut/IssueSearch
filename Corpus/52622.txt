 URL : "https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/3485" TITLE : console history search BODY : ipython has two mechanisms for searching through history: full-text search invoked by ctrl-r / ctrl-s completion search commands having the same beginning invoked by ↑ from a single-line expression by comparison, console supports only the latter, however in a somewhat counter-intuitive manner: a single ↑ brings the cursor to the beginning of the line, the follow-up ones trigger the search, using the previous cursor position. i believe it would be better to make behavior of the completion search identical to that of ipython, and to introduce shortcuts for full-text search.
