 URL : "https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-react/issues/2725" TITLE : datepicker - clear date BODY : hello, the datepicker does not offer the posibility of clearing the date once the user enters it. if you are using the datepicker without allowing text input, there is no way the user can delete the value of the input once he has selected one date. you have to put a button to manually clear the field. it would be nice to have an integrated link/button/whatever to clear the field value. thanks!
