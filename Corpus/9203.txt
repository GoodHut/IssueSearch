 URL : "https://github.com/Aurorastation/Aurora.3/issues/2939" TITLE : two wizard bugs BODY : 1. any polymorph spell, when used, will remove your ability to be a wizard when you turn back. it's not wholly removed and you retain your spells, it just doesn't register you as a proper wizard. 2. when granting a contract to an individual, if they hold a spell that does not require them mage garb hat and robes it still demands these items.
