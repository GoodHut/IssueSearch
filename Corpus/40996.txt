 URL : "https://github.com/datproject/dat-desktop/issues/434" TITLE : what about a daemon? BODY : hi there! i'm currently hacking around with dat and my goal is to use dat on distant servers rather then at home. today, there are 2 user interfaces to manage dats: 1. dat-cli 2. dat-desktop uses multidat i want to be able to manage lists, and it felt natural to build a daemon poc here https://github.com/soyuka/dat-daemon . it got me thinking into having a distant web interface. dat-desktop is good and has everything one may need. would you be interested in a patch that separates the client html, css, front js from electron ? to ease further usage, do you think that a daemon would be a viable option for dat-desktop 's server side so that it could be used anywhere? the daemon would be responsible of managing dats elements add, remove, list, stat . we could even picture cordova in the future to build a dat-phone haha.
