 URL : "https://github.com/jonasoreland/runnerup/issues/601" TITLE : git lfs usage BODY : i would like to use lfs for the ant+ lib as well as the samsung ble lib that will be removed in ng though . ant+ fit should be added the same way the lib in the ant+ submodule is old . the require git 1.8.2 or later files can be handled manually too . https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/installation https://git-lfs.github.com/ for windows, git for windows 2.12 and later includes lfs you still need to run git lfs install once. binary files should not be stored in git but the file is not updated much and i would have been ok with storing the .jar in git too, but jonas did not want that. lfs is much easier in this aspect. i have setup a system with extensively use of submodules at work where submodules mke sense i still believe submodules are cumbersome , but here lfs makes better sense.
