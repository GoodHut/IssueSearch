BODY : hey, i have isntalled your mod and also looked a tutorial on that for the 1.7.10 since the 1.10.2 differs from it but as i have looked in nei i have seen that all the items are looking like pl 2, so i looked to the pl 2 modpage and searched for the 3d book but there isn't any nor is there a key. please check this out and add the missing book, also it looks like the latest 1.7.10 version is an uncompleated 1.10.2 port since i can't identify wich item does what e. g. the transceiver which i did not found in the tutorial for the 1.7.10 version. will be glad that this will be resolved.
