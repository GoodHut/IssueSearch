 URL : "https://github.com/f2prateek/dart/issues/173" TITLE : make the sample work BODY : ideally the sample would be a module, but it's complicated to achieve this with gradle because the android plugin doesn't really cope well with the build task. we can have a look at how other projects deal with it like butterknife. but there are chances that our sample will have to live outside the main gradle build and become an autonomous project. in this case, the hardest will be to report all versions of the dependencies from the main build.gradle file to the sample's build.gradle . usually samples use a stable version, in this case, it won't be possible before we release. making the sample work with a snapshot will be good enough for now.
