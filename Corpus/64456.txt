 URL : "https://github.com/fmang/oshu/issues/40" TITLE : get rid of the terminal BODY : right now, while it stays playable even without, the console is the only way to see the beatmap's metadata and the score at the end. these pieces of information should be displayed on screen, but while printing text is easy, printing it right is harder. there are toy libraries like sdl2_ttf and cairo's truetype module. then there's the full-blown option: pango. pango's got a cairo back-end, so it's sane to integrate it. errors and warnings will still be printed on the console, to help debugging, but it won't be a requirement anymore.
