 URL : "https://github.com/hlissner/.emacs.d/issues/81" TITLE : doesnt work with php BODY : when opening up a php project and navigating to a file, it appears that there is no working php major mode. i am still fairly new to emacs. but when editing a php file, there is no syntax highlight and no completion. i have uncommented the php line in init.el . i have also re-run the install and other setup commands as described in the readme setup and it just tells me theres no new files to compile. so im not sure what to try next.
