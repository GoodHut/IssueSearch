 URL : "https://github.com/SalesforceFoundation/CumulusCI/issues/296" TITLE : created request cleanup BODY : while writing/testing the creation of push upgrades, a lot of requests are created without any intent of them every being started. these requests have a status of created and they tend to clutter things up. my suggestion is to have a task that changes the status of those requests to canceled. once that is done, the requests can be properly filtered out when using the ui, and their purpose is a bit more clear.
