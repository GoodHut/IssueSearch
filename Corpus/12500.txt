 URL : "https://github.com/Nordaaker/convos/issues/340" TITLE : port not visible BODY : if i want to change the settings of a server i see no port. when you save the port is not stored in the connection.json. if the port is not saved eg 6697 , a connection is denied. probably convos then wants to connect to the standard port 6667. you can specify the port, but it is no longer displayed after saving it
