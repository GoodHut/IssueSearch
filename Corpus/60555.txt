 URL : "https://github.com/graalvm/sulong/issues/769" TITLE : absolute path in argv 0 BODY : argv 0 always holds the absolute path to the bitcode file. however, many programs including gnu coreutils do something like this: c printf usage: %s args , argv ; this will always print something like usage: /the/path/to/the/bitcode.bc args in the ideal case, argv 0 would hold the path just like it was specified on the cli e.g. lli argv.bc â†’ argv 0 = argv.bc , because this is the behavior in native executables.
