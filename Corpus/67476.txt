 URL : "https://github.com/djpetti/grobot/issues/56" TITLE : post tests for the mcus BODY : this is a pretty easy task. it would be nice to have a basic post sequence for the mcus. this might include, but is not limited to: - checking temperature sensors for reasonable values. - checking air temperature and humidity for reasonable values. - checking water temperature for reasonable values. - checking water ec and ph for reasonable values assuming there is water. assuming the post sequence fails, probably the best course of action to take is to notify prime. you can create a special message type for this.
