 URL : "https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/issues/3529" TITLE : spi extended mode BODY : on page 10 of esp8266 arduino core documentation release 2.4.0 there is a comment thereâ€™s an extended mode where you can swap the normal pins to the spi0 hardware pins. this is enabled by calling spi.pins 6, 7, 8, 0 before the call to spi.begin . when i try and compile this i get an error that reads 'class spiclass' has no member named 'pins' and when i look at the source i cannot see any implementation of pins. does anyone have any examples of using the extended mode or suggestions on how to use it. i have the spi working on the standard pins but want to use the extended pins if possible
