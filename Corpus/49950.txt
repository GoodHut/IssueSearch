 URL : "https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin/issues/270" TITLE : use pangolin and glew BODY : i want to use pangolin and glew in the same app. when trying this, i get a core dump in the first call to a glew function. for example, in a basic call to: std::vector<float> vertices = ... // load from a file. glbufferdata gl_array_buffer, vertices.size sizeof vertices 0 , &vertices 0 , gl_static_draw ; everything works fine with basic opengl functions, like gldrawarrays . but it seems that the previous gl entrypoints are not found. i have tried to add glewexperimental=true , as it's explaiend here https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/opengl_loading_library , in line 103 of this pangolin src https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/pangolin/blob/master/src/display/device/display_glut.cpp , before the call to glewinit , but the issue persists. how can i achieve to use pangolin and glew in the same app?
