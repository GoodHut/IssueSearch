 URL : "https://github.com/maxthemouse/imagej-plugins/issues/2" TITLE : support multiview ct BODY : need a script to handle the output of the multiview ct program. ct done with the multiview program results in a single long sequence of images with all flats, darks and projections of each view. it would be good to have a script to rename and organize the files. - the first step will be just to rename and move into new folders. this allows people to use any software for processing. - the second step will be to to do the flat-correction processing. this would likely be done at the same time as step one to avoid the overhead of reading and writing each file twice. - the third step will be to add reconstruction or other desired features. these things should be done one at a time. it may better to open new issues for each of these and refer back to this issue.
