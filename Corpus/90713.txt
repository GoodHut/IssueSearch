 URL : "https://github.com/plotly/falcon-sql-client/issues/309" TITLE : sqlite performance is bad BODY : for a sqlite database of 45mb in size i need to wait around 60 seconds before being able to type a 2nd query inside the editor. in between each action this happens. i am running it on an asus zenbook 3, no performance issues in other applications whatsoever. on an i7 octacore desktop the same experience. too much lag to be of any use. maybe the atom editor is not suitable for these kind of things? the editor itself has been plagued with performance issues have been using atom from the start on occasions. they rewrote a couple of performance critical parts in c++, but it still isn't stellar.
