 URL : "https://github.com/m8ttyB/sux/issues/1" TITLE : generate an initial readme BODY : create a readme describing why web accessibility is important and outlining the general goals of this project. we'll get more specific as we begin to understand the problem domain and begin to see the solution we want. - phase 1 - domain knowledge - what web accessibility is and how is accomplished - phase 2 - research - make a list and explore existing open source libraries that have apis that we can use for an automated regression testing suite. ideally the api has support for python or js and allow us to use an xunit framework such as pytest. - phase 3 - create - create a suite of regression tests that we can run at will and include as part of a jenkins pipeline job.
