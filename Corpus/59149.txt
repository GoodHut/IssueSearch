BODY : i'm using an up to date nvidia shield with kodi 17.5. your addon was working fine yesterday but today videos won't play, just the spinning circle then nothing. i discovered a fresh kodi install as well as your repo, tfc.tv. 67. now clicking on the tfc.tv addon gives an error code. 2 errors in the kodi log about python script error report getdirectory - error getting plugin://plugin.video.tfc.tv/ and cguimediawindow : :getdirectory plugin.video.tfctv/ failed it stopped working this morning on all 3 of my shields, one of which still has kodi 17.4 so i don't think it was 17.5 that broke it. any input is appreciated.
