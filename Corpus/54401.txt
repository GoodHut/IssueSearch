 URL : "https://github.com/mordak/Term48/issues/23" TITLE : future hub integration BODY : so i've done some experiments and found that it's possible to hook dynamically-loaded system calls on qnx using ld_preload, same as linux. this means that we can present a virtual file system to whatever programs we wish, completely in user space. specifically, we can use arbitrary blackberry-specific app functions to abstract os features such as the hub into a file system. echo hello world > /hub/sms/+15558675309 sound appealing? or perhaps tar -cz /hub/mail/gmail | gpg -c -o email.tgz.gpg ? just wondering what your thoughts are on this @mordak; though it would be a bit labor-intensive i think it would be a really unique feature for term48.
