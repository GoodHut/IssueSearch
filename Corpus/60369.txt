 URL : "https://github.com/maxpoint/spylon-kernel/issues/28" TITLE : %%scala magic is busted BODY : i'm working on a sizable pr to add doc and clean up various code paths. spotted this along the way. 40 self._interp = get_scala_interpreter 41 ensure that spark is available in the python session as well. ---> 42 self.kernel.cell_magics 'python' .env 'spark' = self._interp.spark_session 43 self.kernel.cell_magics 'python' .env 'sc' = self._interp.sc 44 keyerror: 'python' i'm on the fence about fixing it vs removing support for ipython-to-scala entirely from this package with the goal of making it more single-purpose: a minimal yet solid scala+spark kernel. pixiedust https://ibm-cds-labs.github.io/pixiedust/scalabridge.html and https://github.com/maxpoint/spylon can already be used to do scala in ipython.
