 URL : "https://github.com/udos86/ng2-dynamic-forms/issues/379" TITLE : input text masking BODY : hi, we are using ng2-dynamic-forms v1.4.11 with ng4, we are looking for input text masking feature with dynamic form. e.g. ! image https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16774743/26723366/cfbad54a-47b1-11e7-8c4f-b4d74a5f45ef.png when user focuses input, placeholder moves up and mask pattern appears for input. within ng2-dynamic-forms, 'mask' configuration property is available within dynamicinputmodelconfig. however it looks it is not utilized further. good to have this feature added in ng2-dynamic-forms. thanks in advance.
