 URL : "https://github.com/jldailey13/HoloBlocks/issues/1" TITLE : stability of holograms BODY : hi~ã€€ i focus on reducing offset of holograms these days, and found that stability of holograms in this project satisfied my expectation. in my own apps, as well as _holograms_ app in hololens, holograms have offset in centimeters when i move my head. but in this project they remain in position with little shaking. i looked through in unity and wondered if you have use anchor or anything special to achive stability, only found spatial mapping may matters here. have you ever considered stability in this development? if did, suggestions on it is appreciate. thanks!
