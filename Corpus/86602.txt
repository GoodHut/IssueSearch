 URL : "https://github.com/klokantech/tileserver-gl/issues/217" TITLE : icon-images not rendering BODY : hi i really like the server, however, i can't get the icon-images to render. the docs suggest putting icons within /icons in your data dir - which i've done to no success so i have a few svg icons downloaded from mapbox, but i can't persuade the server to find them. i can get the label to appear but not the associated icon. any help would be greatly appreciated. thanks iain
