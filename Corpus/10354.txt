 URL : "https://github.com/GluuFederation/oxAuth/issues/475" TITLE : can not register BODY : for the oxauth/rp-demo i read that: 1. first of all you need to register your own client for your rp client : a via admin ui example: https://ce-dev2.gluu.org b via dynamic registration endpoint https://ce-dev2.gluu.org/oxauth/login only shows a login and i see no method to register a client. i assume i am missing something?
