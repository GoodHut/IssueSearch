 URL : "https://github.com/evolvio/evolv.io/issues/173" TITLE : more complex senses BODY : as suggested in we could have scent, hearing, etc. although i'd like to propose we, rather than having lines where the creature can see, we have a field of view, where the creatures can see a very large distance, but perhaps with some kind of blurring or distortion for the creatures, perhaps a hue shift / randomizing or something, this would especially create predatory action because the creatures would be able see prey from a distance, and hunt it down, just like in the real world, you can see an almost infinite distance, the only problem is that the earth is round, thus causing the horizon.
