BODY : trying to open a zip archive with 7-zip. if i just right-click the file and extract it using the 7-zip -> extract files... button, everything works fine. but if i open it with 7-zip's gui, select the files in the archive and extract it, 7-zip reports headers error . i even dumped all the bytes returned by my readfile method and compare it with my zip file, but no difference found.
