 URL : "https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/1540" TITLE : emacs packages not found BODY : hi, great app, linux for android. the issue is with emacs, the .emacs file a.k.a init.el has no issue on linux or windows in their respective versions , but the melpa packages, which reside in ~/.emacs.d/elpa /data/data/com.termux/files/home/... are not found, the package should be loaded with the given text in the .emacs file: add-to-list 'load-path ~/.emacs.d/elpa/<package> require '<package> but when the app executes the emacs --daemon or when emacs does a m-x -> byte-compile-file -> ~/.emacs it returns package not found . which seems strange. a m-x -> list-packages shows the packages are installed.
