 URL : "https://github.com/clearbit/clearbit-node/issues/31" TITLE : no option to supress logs BODY : when using clearbit to lookup info, a log is added to the console / stdout with the following signature making request 1 { protocol: 'https:', host: 'company-stream.clearbit.com', port: 443, path: '/v2/companies/find?domain=google.com', method: 'get', headers: { accept: ' / ', connection: 'close', 'user-agent': 'clearbitnode/v1.3.3' ... currently there is no way to suppress these logs. i believe the underlying root cause is the way clearbit/needle https://github.com/clearbit/needle handles the logs. since this is a forked version of needle, upgrading the version of needle could solve this issue as the new version of needle uses the debug module. code reference: node_modules/lib/needle.js line 25 the best possible option is to provide a way for the clearbit-node client to suppress logs and perform the check in the underlying needle module. var client = require 'clearbit' .client var clearbit = new client { key: 'api_key' log: false }
