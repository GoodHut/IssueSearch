 URL : "https://github.com/dagwieers/unoconv/issues/411" TITLE : add more maintainers BODY : this project has 144 issues open, and no code changes for two years, and the last release isn't even on pypi. as a maintainer of several modules myself i understand it's hard to get time to maintain all the libraries, but perhaps the users of the module could help? maybe even hand the keys over to someone else?
