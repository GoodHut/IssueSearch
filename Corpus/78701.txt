 URL : "https://github.com/timusus/Shuttle/issues/80" TITLE : recently played playlist BODY : requesting this feature because i keep track of my playcounts locally, so after i listen on my phone, i come to my computer and update the playcount tag on the songs i listened to, manually. normally i use the simple last.fm scrobbler to keep track of this list without scrobbling anything , but i'd rather have it all in one app, and also sometimes the scrobbler bugs.
