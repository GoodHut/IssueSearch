 URL : "https://github.com/sbabaei/Vsts/issues/1" TITLE : example path configuration BODY : this is not an issue per se, but more a suggestion /cry for help. could you provide some examples for the path configurations? if tried those: \bin\$ buildconfiguration \apisql.tests.dll.config $/supertext/supertext/apisql.tests/app.debug.config while the 2nd one works, i get a no attribute 'key' exists for the match locator and it's really not the file i need to transform. i would need the transform the the apisql.tests.dll.config file that is in the bin/debug folder. any ideas?
