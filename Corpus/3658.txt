 URL : "https://github.com/robertsj/me400_notes/issues/17" TITLE : syllabus + hw BODY : make it very clear what homework + regrade policy is. we haven't had too many issues this term, but solidify the process: 1. test with student tester. can we have a final all tests have run message saying it should be good to go? can we enforces a reset? should we do from student_module import x, y, z or just use import student_module to avoid naming issues? add checks to prevent name overwrites? 2. things will slip by this system. we'll allow one re-do capped at 4/6 credit. the offending code must be commented or returned to its template form. a written request must be made to the instructor and grader within one week of grades being released. 3. file uploads must be verified. uploading an incorrect file is not excuse to upload the correct file later after the due date. hence, verify all uploads after the fact the same goes for exams! .
