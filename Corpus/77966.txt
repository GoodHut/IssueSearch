 URL : "https://github.com/hotio/docker-suitarr/issues/1" TITLE : overwriting config files BODY : hi. i really like your idea, and i wanted to test it, unfortunately the docker-file seems to overwrite the default ports and use post 8080. this means i can't use you're software since i depend on an vpn-client and a nginx reverse-proxy fron dperson dperson/nginx and dperson/openvpn-client here on github . is there any way you could have your dockerfile check for existing config-files in the -v config-file argument, instead of just overwriting it? i can elaborate if my question is unclear .... thanks in advance!
