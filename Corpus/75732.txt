 URL : "https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/game-project/issues/574" TITLE : i would like a git re-do BODY : i have had too many issues with git since i first deployed the wrong way. i would like a re-do if possible, since i'm still receiving a lot of conflicts which makes it difficult for me to continue it's extra work and too confusing/risky . is it possible to take the code i have and duplicate/start from scratch with a fresh deploy? https://jonifallon.github.io/tic-tic-toe/
