 URL : "https://github.com/dillbyrne/random-agent-spoofer/issues/543" TITLE : v0.9.5.6 - outdated? BODY : while reading through some of the issues on here, i noticed a few features were missing on ras, such as the timezone spoofing feature, which isn't available on version 0.9.5.6 the one i have. apparently, there's a version 0.9.5.7 out there, though i wasn't able to find it. i first heard of it while reading through the issues mentioned earlier. sorry if this isn't the right place to post this; just want some answers.
