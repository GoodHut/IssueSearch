 URL : "https://github.com/kvizcarra/notes/issues/2" TITLE : add note detail page BODY : add a detail page that shows when you tap a note in the note list. it should show the title and value of the note in edittext s. the same detail page but with empty edittext s should be shown when the fab is pressed. don't worry about inserting and updating a note, that will be handle in another issue.
