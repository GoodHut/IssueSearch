 URL : "https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo/issues/72" TITLE : flow app directory BODY : refering to the end of https://tibcosoftware.github.io/flogo/extensions-developer/create-activity/ i was a bit lost and started the docker container with my flogo ui and to my surprise, i discovered my helloworld app there. so was flogogen automatically installing the activity somehow? i would have prefered to do this manually but had no idea where my flow directory is - where is it? i assume in the docker container or is it linked to an outside volume?
