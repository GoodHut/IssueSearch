 URL : "https://github.com/michaelficarra/proposal-first-class-protocols/issues/20" TITLE : protocol overriding order BODY : i wonder how protocols override. that is: js protocol i { a } protocol a { i.a { return 0 } } protocol b { i.a { return 1 } } class c implements a, b {} assert new c i.a // 0 or 1? i didn't see mixing two protocols with conflicting symbols in the spec. apologize in advance if i missed it.
