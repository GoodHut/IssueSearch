 URL : "https://github.com/drone/drone/issues/2037" TITLE : move cli to drone-cli BODY : why change back to a separate cli repository? some things have changed that makes this a more viable approach than it was before. 1. the runtime is now in a separate repository that can be imported for use by drone exec 2. the drone api is stabilizing 3. the cli is no longer required for daily use with the remove of the signature file there is also a lot of community interest around improving the cli. by decoupling the cli from the core repository i hope to achieve the following: 1. increase the pace of improvements 2. reduce the number of outstanding pull requests 3. increase the number of individuals with write access
