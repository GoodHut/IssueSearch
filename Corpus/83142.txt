 URL : "https://github.com/kstenerud/Musashi/issues/27" TITLE : bug x flag of asr and lsr BODY : hi karl, the document says the x-bit is set to the last bit shifted out of the operand and is equal to the c-bit. however, a zero shift count leaves the x-bit unaffected and the c-bit cleared. the current implementation of musashi certainly clears the x flag when shift count is zero. flag_x = flag_c = src << 9-shift ; it should be like the following flag_c = src << 9-shift ; if shift { flag_x = flag_c; } i'm sorry to create this issue instead of making a pull request. regards, steve
