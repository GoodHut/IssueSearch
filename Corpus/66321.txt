 URL : "https://github.com/zeit/next.js/issues/656" TITLE : missing a prefix option BODY : for now. i can't find a way to runing my next project under a sub path eg. http://localhost:3000/myapp/ . i try to write custom server by myself. but /_next/main.js , /_next/commons.js and /static/ still read from root path. if there is a prefix option that i can set next start --prefix=/myapp . it will work with nginx proxy_pass easily.
