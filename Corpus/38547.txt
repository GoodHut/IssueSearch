 URL : "https://github.com/digitalocean/netbox/issues/784" TITLE : prefix subnet lookup BODY : it would be nice if you could lookup the subnet when entering an ip address to a device. if you've a lot of prefixes defined it can be hard to remember the defined prefix when you enter the ip address. maybe the input field could show a short list of prefixes in a kind of pop-up next to the input field to help you out which prefix to select. i am aware this could be complex to figure this out how this should work, especially with ipv6, but it would be a great enhancement. maybe some one else can add some suggestions?
