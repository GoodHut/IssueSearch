 URL : "https://github.com/mosra/magnum-bootstrap/issues/12" TITLE : build output directories BODY : currently the build output is scattered deep into the project tree which makes it difficult for new users and/or to setup a new project. bootstrap\magnum\src\magnum\release bootstrap\corrade\src\corrade\utility\release bootstrap\corrade\src\corrade\pluginmanager\release as you know, those directories contain the .lib and .dll files required for the bootstrap myapplication . as a new user finding these files proved a bit difficult. as projects grow in size, requiring more features, the complexity of setting up your project increases. could we have bootstrap generate project files to dump the build output indo a unified folder? bootstrap\build\bin bootstrap\build\lib this allows users to set their projects up to use these directories then when more features are required just build them and copy over the .dll; no need to add more paths to the project and dig through folders for the output. thank you for your time and dedication to this project!
