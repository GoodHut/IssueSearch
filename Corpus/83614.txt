 URL : "https://github.com/jevalenciap/iptodomain/issues/4" TITLE : changes that must be made BODY : hi , there are a few things that you should change in your script . by default if anyone writes only ./iptodomain.py or python iptodomain.py , the mouse icon changes to a cross and the user loose the capability to do whatever he wants because you can move the mouse but the clicks of it for executions like close a window or going to menu does not work . my guess is that you forgot to write the code that detects when there is no variables are inserted by user , and where by default should display the help or same thing as ./iptodomain.py -h , and because of the script does not have that code , then starts executing something that does not exist variables , and stay there forever . due to this missing code in the script i could only get out of it by rebooting the linux over ctrl+alt+f5 , because the mouse was hanged on your script .
