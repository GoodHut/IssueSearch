 URL : "https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-java/issues/132" TITLE : add all deps in onbuild BODY : starting a new container from the image will make the container to download and build all dependencies of abjs. this takes a long time. would be cool to to that only once in onbuild . besides the android sdk which we _can_ not bundle and redistribute in the toolchain image, we probably also do not _want_ to bundle all dependencies in the image, but add them in onbuild , before the library and examples are built into 2 apks.
