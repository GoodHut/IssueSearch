 URL : "https://github.com/iceddev/pg-connection-string/issues/13" TITLE : generic connection string BODY : i have implemented a generic-version connection-string https://github.com/vitaly-t/connection-string , which could be used by this library as a special case for postgresql. it would support only the first segment as property database . it would allow only special values for the protocol , such as postgres + socket the rest i think would be directly reusable.
