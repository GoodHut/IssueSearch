 URL : "https://github.com/w3c/alreq/issues/144" TITLE : tidy fix bdi formatting BODY : looks like the tidy tool coming with mac does not allow overriding the type of a known tag, like bdi . for the latest tidy development, i have filed an issue here: https://github.com/htacg/tidy-html5/issues/616 if we want to get the right formatting with the existing tool, we have to replace our <bdi> usage with <span style= unicode-bidi: isolate; > .
