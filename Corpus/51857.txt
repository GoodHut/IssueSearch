 URL : "https://github.com/leanjscom/universal-create-react-app/issues/5" TITLE : broken dynamic imports BODY : first of all, thanks for creating this, it's awesome and so helpful! when using default create react app, we can use dynamic imports to lazy load modules using react router: example https://serverless-stack.com/chapters/code-splitting-in-create-react-app.html with your version, when it breaks when we try to use the same technique. i've changed the webpack config in config/webpack.config.client.dev.js line 24 to use the 'stock client', which seems to make it work, but the build still fails for the production version. is this something you can help with please?
