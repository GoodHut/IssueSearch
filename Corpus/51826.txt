 URL : "https://github.com/tabalinas/jsgrid/issues/589" TITLE : bootstrap grid refresh BODY : i have a js-grid embedded in a bootstrap accordion. to format the grid format i call the following: $ ' accordion' .on 'shown.bs.collapse', function e { $ ' jsgridmygrid' .jsgrid 'refresh' ; } this works fine and the grid sizes etc correctly but the refresh is visible to the user, it there any way to hide the refresh process so when the user views the grid it is already refreshed and doesn't 'snap' into place. thanks.
