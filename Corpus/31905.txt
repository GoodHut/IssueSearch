 URL : "https://github.com/lkl/linux/issues/377" TITLE : tcp/ip stack in lkl BODY : hi has anyone tried to use just the tcp/ip stack of lkl? i want to see if there is a way to bypass the other lkl layers and just directly be able to pass a packet to ip layer, for example. i am finding it a little difficult to include skbuff.h in my application and have to keep resolving build issues. any pointers? thanks!
