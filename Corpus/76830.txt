 URL : "https://github.com/ayush-bhandari/mdCountrySelect/issues/1" TITLE : make selection mandatory BODY : this directive isn't able to require the choice of a country, much like other angular-material directives do, such as: <md-input-container flex= 50 > <label>name</label> <input required= name= studentname ng-model= project.name > <div ng-messages= registerstudentform.studentname.$error > <div ng-message= required >this is required.</div> </div> </md-input-container> something similar and optional, by using an attribute for this directive would be great, as allows the developer to make the choice required or not.
