 URL : "https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura/issues/1981" TITLE : z hop feedrate BODY : the command to make the z hop, does not have a feedrate specified. so it would be something like g1 z1.3 so now it is depending on the feedrate set by a previous command. this could be ultra fast or ultra slow, which then takes forever to move it. option would be to give it the max_feedrate_z_override parameter, or a separate z_hop_feedrate parameter
