 URL : "https://github.com/l800891/CLTypingLabel/issues/10" TITLE : center text not working BODY : hello, testing this on ios 10.3.3 on an iphone 7 building with xcode 8.3.3. when i set center text to on in the storyboard the text is still left aligned. i have tried switching the text alignment between left align and center align. when it is on center align, the text moves back and forth each time a letter is typed, but still is left aligned. i have ensured that i have my constraints set properly. not sure what else could be causing this.
