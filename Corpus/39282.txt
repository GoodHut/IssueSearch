 URL : "https://github.com/earthref/MagIC/issues/37" TITLE : save import template BODY : i see the text on the website when you hover over the import template button, but want to add it as an issue also. i think this is the most important feature enhancement to work on at the moment. it is crucial to have for people who want to use the web interface to upload. i don't want to heavily promote putting data into magic with the website interface until we have this feature.
