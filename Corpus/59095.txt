 URL : "https://github.com/yegor256/cactoos/issues/169" TITLE : test matchers location BODY : at this moment some successors of org.hamcrest.typesafematcher are located at root org.cactoos package among important high level interfaces. i think the new matchers should be removed from this place somewhere. 1. the best options is to put them into a new library e.g. cactoos-test is dependent from cactoos . in this case these classes will not be located in client prod code if it's used prod cactoos lib. the client has to use cactoos-test only for it's tests via test scope dependency <scope>test</scope> in maven . 2. the easiest option is to move them at least into specialized org.cactoos.match package. wdyt?
