 URL : "https://github.com/arnested/drupal-mode/issues/80" TITLE : failing installs via melpa BODY : i'm running emacs 25 on mac os x. i'm trying to install drupal-mode by simply running m-x, package-install, drupal-mode. it seems that all of drupal-mode's optional dependencies are actually required when installed this way, as the install fails with a lot of errors about missing dependencies. i was able to resolve a few of them by installing flymake-phps, ggtags, php-mode, and others deleting the drupal-mode directory in the .emacs.d/elpa folder each time , but i still can't figure out how to resolve this: > helm-gtags.el:28:1:error: cannot open load file: no such file or directory, helm-gtags > gtags.el:28:1:error: cannot open load file: no such file or directory, gtags
