 URL : "https://github.com/ampache/ampache/issues/1531" TITLE : track number in title BODY : hallo i found two problems with track numbers: 1. if i create a catalog with this pattern: %t %t without hyphen the track number will be part of the title example 02 lovesong 2. additional to the track number of my collection i added the cd number. the syntax is: 1-03 lovesong.mp3 ampache can't handle this. my workaround is to remove the hyphen in the vainfo.class.php the track number is now 103 - and that's ok and running michael
