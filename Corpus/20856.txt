 URL : "https://github.com/waiting-for-dev/front_matter_parser/issues/3" TITLE : date parsing fails BODY : i have frontmatter like this: --- title: 'cool title' date: 2012-01-11 categories: foo --- this fails with: ruby frontmatterparser::parser.parse_file str => psych::disallowedclass: tried to load unspecified class: date i'm pretty sure the root cause is https://github.com/ruby/psych/issues/262 and that the parser is attempting to run date.new '2012-01-11' , but i haven't nailed it down yet. i might be able to write a customer parser to overwrite how the frontmatter is being parsed, i guess? was wondering if there was a different solution or if anyone had any insight?
