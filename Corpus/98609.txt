 URL : "https://github.com/xyzz/acquisition/issues/430" TITLE : item showed up on one side BODY : i've listed my item on acquisition but turns out it is only showed on the poe official trade site but not poe.trade and yes i've verified everything is correct, i even changed to a new control url and double checked my shop thread, waited for more than an hour still not showing up. thanks for looking into it,
