 URL : "https://github.com/rebus-org/Rebus/issues/609" TITLE : sql transport locking BODY : hi, when i am looking at the messages table in sql using sql management studio sometimes the returns results are very slow. for instance in my very small table of not even 20 rows, the select top 1000... in studio took over 30 seconds to run. this is only while a message is being processed of course. it seems that rebus is locking the table for this whole operation which does take a while to run. is this just because studio or does this sound like i have something configured wrong? i know there's been lots of discussions around the sql locking row with snapshot etc but i didn't really see an answer to this problem i'm seeing.
