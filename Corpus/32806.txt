BODY : hello, i know this is not the place but i saw the wp version of slider pro on a client's website and since i'm not a client on code canyon i don't think i can leave you this message there. when you update a slider, you are supposed to delete all slides and all slide layers before inserting them again. but in your save_slider function you are deleting the slides twice but not the layers so all the layers are left in place in the db referencing slides ids that don't exist anymore. line 669: $wpdb->query $wpdb->prepare delete from . $wpdb->prefix . slider_pro_slides where slider_id = %d , $id ; $wpdb->query $wpdb->prepare delete from . $wpdb->prefix . slider_pro_slides where slider_id = %d , $id ; i thought i'd let you know take care
