 URL : "https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord/issues/55" TITLE : migrate to mit license BODY : currently the project code is licensed under the apache 2.0 apache license. this often causes problems when users/developers the project i'll migrate my nord project and all of it's official port projects to the mit license as soon as possible. i've got some requests from other contributors and larger open source projects that would like to include my theme into their projects mainly code editors and ui framework , but had conflicts with the license type. i've started to use the apache 2.0 license based on the fact that it has been used by almost all large projects, but in the last years it came out that the mit license is much better when it comes to raise the open source movement without having to worry about all this crappy legal stuff :smile: i'll try to migrate all of my projects and update this pr until no later than the end of the next week, best even until this evening to finally check off this task from my list :rocket: apache : http://www.apache.org/licenses/license-2.0
