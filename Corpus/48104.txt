 URL : "https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/3093" TITLE : remote write bulk api BODY : i wanted to write a tool that ships the 2.0 blocks to a remote storage, but looks like there is interest from the others as well. especially as it allows for bulk insert which is much more efficient. the plan currently for me is: make a tool promtool subcommand which actually ships the block off to the remote-storage and mark it experimental and iterate on the fields and format of the api and once we have a couple of users, fold it into prometheus. @tomwilkie @pauldix do you guys think this makes sense? or do we want to ship the chunks instead of the block? shipping the block actually makes it really hard to write the integration in language other than and will heavily depend on the structure of tsdb.
