 URL : "https://github.com/ga-wdi-exercises/project4/issues/550" TITLE : jquery div wrapper BODY : i'm appending google place results to my page, and trying to wrap each result in it's own div. lines 107 - 139 are where i pull the details, then display the results. repo: https://github.com/colleeno/weather-app this is in the public/script.js file currently i'm just appending each item to the section id placeresults. what i'd like is to have lines 119-135 wrapped in a container div. i tried using jquery's .wrap , but can only apply that to each p. i tried creating a div as the first line in the display function, and appending each item to that, but that inserts them all into one overall div, not each individual place into a div. i tried some foreach functions, couldn't get anything to work.. i could only make it work if i create a div and add the items within it like below, but then i can't include any of the conditional statements i need. but this is what i'm trying to do for each place. $ <div> <p>${place.name}</p> <p>${place.formatted_address}</p> </div> .appendto ' placeresults' apologies in advance, this is not the cleanest right now -_-
