 URL : "https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle/issues/998" TITLE : failures to apply delta BODY : in my server logs i see 8%-15% of users download both delta and a full update, which i'm assuming the delta failed to apply. e.g. > 1.1.1.1 - - 13/jan/2017:09:49:07 +0000 get /imageoptim1.7.0a1-1.6.5a3.delta http/1.1 200 650558 - imageoptim/1.6.5a3 sparkle/1.15.1 mac os x 10.12.2 > 1.1.1.1 - - 13/jan/2017:09:49:08 +0000 get /imageoptim1.7.0a1.tar.bz2 http/1.1 200 1394498 - imageoptim/1.6.5a3 sparkle/1.15.1 mac os x 10.12.2 if it was just 1-2% i'd assume people modified the app, but 15% is a bit much. i'm seeing the failures consistently across many versions of my app, so it's not a problem with any particular update. and i can't reproduce the failure on my machine. does anyone else see the problem? shall we add some form of delta-crash-report sending?
