 URL : "https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/issues/1470" TITLE : compiling with gcc6/gcc7 BODY : hi, this is probably related to 1316. currently the arch linux and fedora distributions patch gnuradio e.g. arch https://git.archlinux.org/svntogit/community.git/tree/repos/community-x86_64/gnuradio-gcc7.patch?h=packages/gnuradio&id=d61c3e4db7741753208286f32d33dbf26cd2bb53 , fedora http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/gnuradio.git/commit/gnuradio-3.7.11-gcc-7-compile-fix.patch?id=b2f5f351c1181867ea28146e2cfd91d9d6d57cb4 . i am about to do the same for nix see nixos/nixpkgs 29740, gnuradio 3.7.11 . in nix, we are even still on gcc6 as the default compiler. it would be really good if the next release included this patch, or an equivalent fix. cheers!
