 URL : "https://github.com/mountetna/rtemis/issues/8" TITLE : add an r service BODY : currently we are using python's rpy2 interface to call r. this works ok, but why not use an r service instead? the advantages of this approach: 1 less indirection - it may be difficult to handle passing r objects into and out of python methods. using r directly will surely be easier and will involve less scaffolding code. 2 better dependency management - currently we have both r and python dependencies being tracked in pythia. instead we can track r packages in the r service, python packages in pythia. 3 cleaner codebases, only-python or only-r instead of having r and python code files in one place. the service 'rtemis' can be built using rook, a rack analog for r, and deployed using rapache, an apache module that runs r code. with such a service we can: 4 mainline r functions into timur's manifest interface. some r functions might require help to be converted, but the r list type is similar to timur's vector, and the r data frame is similar to timur's matrix , and both are common r return types. with a thin js transport layer, we can easily add in r functions to timur.
