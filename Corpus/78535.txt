 URL : "https://github.com/sixty-north/cosmic-ray/issues/228" TITLE : pypi out of date 0.1.2 ! BODY : using pip==9.0.1 under python 3 and running pip install --user cosmic_ray or pip install --user cosmic-ray installs cosmic_ray 0.1.2. running pip install --user cosmic_ray==1.1.0a1 will install that version, however. if i try installing the current version 2.0.0a0 this way, however, i get the message: $ pip3 install --user cosmic_ray==2.0.0a0 downloading/unpacking cosmic-ray==2.0.0a0 could not find a version that satisfies the requirement cosmic-ray==2.0.0a0 from versions: 1.1.0a1, 1.0.0a1, 0.1.0, 0.1.1, 1.0.0a0, 1.0.0a0.macosx-10.10-x86_64, 0.1.2 so there seem to be two problems: 1 pypi is serving an older version of the package rather than the most recent version in its index; and 2 verson 2.0.0a0 has not been added to pypi yet.
