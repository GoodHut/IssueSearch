 URL : "https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper/issues/1878" TITLE : iqueryable auto mapper BODY : i have ef data object in repository project where as my business logic method uses businessobjects. i am using automapper for conversion from data obejct to business object. but if my business logic methid returns iqueryable<businessobject>. so i have 2 options 1. convert db object into business objects and then make it asquerable 2. automapper on queryable. approach looks better if it doesn't traverse enumerate for conversion. i just want to know whether it traverses though collection and maps entities??
