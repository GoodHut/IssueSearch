 URL : "https://github.com/petester42/jest-preset-typescript-react-native/issues/4" TITLE : ts config + source maps BODY : hi, we want to generate test coverage information, but this preset doesn't include sourcemap in the generated ts config: https://github.com/petester42/jest-preset-typescript-react-native/blob/5494154d7aae701a1efed1a4903c1f42fb2a1bf2/preprocessor.js l2-l8 and there's no way to add it in. this results in the coverage data being incorrect. would it be possible to read in options from package.json similar to how ts-jest works, or at least add sourcemap to the default config? thanks for the useful project too, by the way!
