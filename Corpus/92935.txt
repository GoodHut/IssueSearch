_originally opened as https://github.com/steem-fossbot/steem-fossbot.github.io/issues/10_ ---- on steemit.com there is no way to get a feed sorted by most active posts, where activity is defined as posts which have the most comments this could be refined . for example, something to get the 10 most active discussions on steemit for you to get involved in right now . for now this could be a standalone tool, similar to what tags. idea by at son-of-satire, also requested by at stellabelle
