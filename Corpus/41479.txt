 URL : "https://github.com/Hello23-Ygopro/ygopro-kaijudo/issues/6" TITLE : 6dsi scripting issues BODY : - 1. _bottle of wishes_ 6/60 card.getactivateeffect is needed for such cards, but it's incompatible with kaijudo's spells, since they use effect_type_ignition , and not effect_type_activate . - possible solution: add the revealed spell to the owner's hand as a rule and use duel.raiseevent e:gethandler ,event_custom+event_free_cast,e,0,0,0,0 , then add setcost aux.true + setcode event_custom+event_free_cast to all spells.
