 URL : "https://github.com/sanctuary-js/sanctuary/issues/434" TITLE : add insert for objects BODY : would be great to have an insert function similar to ramda's assoc http://ramdajs.com/docs/ assoc . i like the name insert better as that seems more clear when working with other dictionary apis elm http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest/dict insert and haskell http://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers-0.5.10.2/docs/data-map-lazy.html v:insert . the type signature might be something like: haskell insert :: string -> any -> object -> object an implementation might look like the following: javascript function insert key, value, object { var newentry = {}; newentry key = value; return object.assign newentry, object ; } s.insert = def ‘insert’, {}, $.string, $.any, $.object, $.object , insert ; if an insert function makes sense for sanctuary, i'm happy to create a pull request.
