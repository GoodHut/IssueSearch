 URL : "https://github.com/JuliaParallel/PETSc.jl/issues/90" TITLE : empty buildopts.conf file BODY : i am installing petsc.jl for the first time and keep getting the following error: loaderror: loaderror: at row 0, column 0 : argumenterror number of rows in dims must be > 0, got 0 while loading /home/bkobrin/.julia/v0.4/petsc/deps/build_petscs.jl, in expression starting on line 13 while loading /home/bkobrin/.julia/v0.4/petsc/deps/build.jl, in expression starting on line 9 i tracked down the error and i believe it is caused by the fact that my buildopts.conf file is completely empty. does anyone know how to fix this?
