 URL : "https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa/issues/1255" TITLE : zappa and new relic BODY : hey! i'm using the latest version of zappa and am trying to integrate newrelic into my applications. i have both django as well as flask applications which i'd like to monitor with newrelic. i integrated the framework as documented by wrapping the wsgi application and set the newrelic timeout variables accordingly to make sure data is getting sent. in my newrelic dashboard i'm able to see the project but no data is reported. has anyone had success getting this running? thanks!
