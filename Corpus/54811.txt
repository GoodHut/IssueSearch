 URL : "https://github.com/haskell-lang/haskell-lang/issues/131" TITLE : how to contribute page BODY : people occasionally ask how they can contribute back to haskell. it would be nice to have a page on this site that we could point people to, covering things like: documentation efforts that could use assistance projects that have well labeled newcomer issues ways to help newer users like answering stack overflow questions i'm sure there are dozens of other things worth adding to this list. i'm hoping to crowdsource a bunch of ideas here, and then someone i'll do it if no one else wants to can put together a page sharing these ideas on the site. pinging @alexeyzab. @tfausak thought you may have some feedback on this.
