 URL : "https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa/issues/728" TITLE : certify fails sometimes BODY : context zappa certify fails sometimes with this error message. though the next run might be successful or i might get this error again, i couldn't notice any pattern here. badrequestexception: an error occurred badrequestexception when calling the createdomainname operation: unable to update/create cloudfront distribution for this domain name. the specified ssl certificate isn't valid or doesn't include a valid certificate chain. i'm pretty sure the cert is valid and have a valid chain. expected behavior avoid failing or give more meaningful error message. actual behavior it happens only from time to time. possible fix can't suggest. it might be aws issue, not zappa's. steps to reproduce your environment <!--- include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in --> zappa version used: 0.39.1 operating system and python version: 2.7.13 my config: --- dev: app_function: alarm_service.app aws_region: ap-southeast-2 s3_bucket: zappa-alarm-service certificate_arn: --removed-- domain: alarms-dev.brightwrite.com api_key_required: true prod: app_function: alarm_service.app aws_region: ap-southeast-2 s3_bucket: zappa-alarm-service certificate_arn: --removed-- domain: alarms.brightwrite.com api_key_required: true
