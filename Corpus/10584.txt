 URL : "https://github.com/geanders/rj_draft_drat_data/issues/1" TITLE : couple of issues BODY : thanks for setting up the repo. some quick comments from the top of my head as issue we may want to tick off one by one: - hadley's book, nice it as may be, is _not_ the canonical reference. writing r extensions is. - rstudio, helpful as it is, is not the principal interface to r. r's commands are, and scripting is. but it is excellent to _also_ have rstudio and screenshots. - probably need to expand discussion / intro of drat itself - mention bioc and data packages as part of main repo / additional repo? we leave the user more degrees of freedom. during the initial drafting phase, shall we close the repo?
