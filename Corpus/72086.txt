 URL : "https://github.com/captivationsoftware/react-sticky/issues/174" TITLE : automate tests being run BODY : it'd be good to have the tests automatically run including a coverage report as well as a badge in the readme. likely would have to setup travis ci https://travis-ci.org/ or alternative and use coveralls coveralls.io . happy to submit a pr, but want to make sure it's wanted and that i don't step on anyone's toes.
