 URL : "https://github.com/CovertJaguar/Railcraft/issues/1136" TITLE : ic2 module issues BODY : multiple issues with the ic2 module that should be fixed before the release: - ic2 upgrades energy storage, transformer, overclocker, etc. cannot be added to the energy loader and unloader there is also no button showing which ones can be added, likely related - macerating obsidian --> crushed obsidian doesn't work in default configs requires outside modifications to support. caused by a recipe conflict - look into adding uranium mines for those who would prefer railcraft-style prospecting
