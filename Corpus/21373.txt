 URL : "https://github.com/ludumdare/ludumdare/issues/967" TITLE : fairer danger list BODY : i would like to suggest a modification to the danger category. i find it almost offensive that a game with ratings received / ratings given 18/3 can be on the front page at position 2 of the danger list while a game with 13/28 is pushed down to page 2. maybe the danger list can be sorted by received \ coolness instead of received as i assume it’s currently done . this change would favor games that contributed and are close to the minimum votes over of those that didn’t contribute. another option would be to have an additional filter “below 20 received”. that way people could simply use the coolness filter, switch on the “below 20” filter and get all deserving games, not only those that are easy to save.
