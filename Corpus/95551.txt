 URL : "https://github.com/coopcycle/coopcycle-web/issues/120" TITLE : default address when order BODY : i add one user address in my account. but when i order, the address form is initialized with a other address. the bug is in restaurantcontroller.php, i not understand this code // we need to compute the geohash, because of small differences between geodata from the back and from the front $address = $user->getaddresses ->filter function $address use $addressdata, $geotools { $addresscoordinate = new coordinate $address->getgeo ->getlatitude , $address->getgeo ->getlongitude ; $basketcoordinate = new coordinate $addressdata 'latitude' , $addressdata 'longitude' ; return $geotools->geohash ->encode $addresscoordinate, 9 ->getgeohash === $geotools->geohash ->encode $basketcoordinate, 9 ->getgeohash ; } ; why a filter is needed ? when i delete the filter, the address form is initialized with my first address.
