 URL : "https://github.com/exercism/exercism.io/issues/3619" TITLE : issue with submission BODY : i have done as much research on this as i could find. google puts out almost nothing of use. forgive a novice jumping in over his head. i bet this is a really simple solution, but my research has not been fruitful yet. this is also my first question, so unsure if i'm breaking any rules. i have tried using the readme's, etc. you can see the three ways i have tried solving this problem below: c:\users\master\exercism>exercism submit python/hello-world.py 2017/09/01 21:54:45 unable to submit - bad path to exercise file. you're trying to submit a solution file from inside your exercises directory, but it looks like the directory structure is something that exercism doesn't recognize as a valid file path. first, make a copy of your solution file and save it outside of c:\users\master\exercism then, run exercism fetch . move your solution file back to the correct exercise directory for the problem you're working on. it should be somewhere inside c:\users\master\exercism if you are having trouble, you can file a github issue at https://github.com/exercism/exercism.io/issues c:\users\master\exercism>exercism submit python/hello-world 2017/09/01 21:54:52 please specify each file that should be submitted, e.g. exercism submit file1 file2 file3 . c:\users\master\exercism>cd/python the system cannot find the path specified.
