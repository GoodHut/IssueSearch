 URL : "https://github.com/starside/Python_PIC_Gui/issues/6" TITLE : persistent values bug BODY : there is a bug with cross-talk between plots. for example, if you open two simultaneous energy graphs, and use the graph overlay options, the options affect both open graphs. i believe the reason is that the plot data object is shared between both viewing windows, and both modify the state of the object. i need to find a way to copy it.
