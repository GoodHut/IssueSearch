 URL : "https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress/issues/640" TITLE : default ingress domains BODY : apologies - this feels like an extremely basic question to be asking, but i can't seem to find an answer to it by searching online. i would like to be able to set a default ingress domain on either an ingress controller or perhaps on the kubernetes namespace which will get automatically appended to the hostname on ingress objects, e.g:- set an ingress controller or namespace with a default domain of mycompany.com and then create ingress resources with a 'hostname' = 'myservice1'. this would create an ingress that responds on myservice1.mycompany.com. this is how i believe that routes worked openshift and allows us to create more portable application deployments because the same ingress object can be deployed to different clusters without having to resort to external templating the domain. have i managed to miss this capability? regards dave
