 URL : "https://github.com/geocoder-php/Geocoder/issues/681" TITLE : separate http providers BODY : about 40% of the providers we currently have in this lib does not require http. the common package should therefore not require psr7 and httplug stuff. however, there is one class in common abstracthttpprovider that is depending on http stuff. we could: a ignore the dependencies of this class and move all php-http/ requirements to the providers. b create a new package geocoder-php/common-http which has all php-http/ requirements and the abstracthttpprovider . i think we should do b since it is better package design. abstracthttpprovider is really an outlier in common.
