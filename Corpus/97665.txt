 URL : "https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/5030" TITLE : how do i debug angular-cli BODY : hi, not sure if this is the right place to post a question if not, let me know . i'm new to open source development - and i would like to start contributing to open source projects. angular-cli seems like a good one to contir as i often use it. so i'm trying to learn the code base and how it all works. i was wondering, can anyone post steps on how i can get line by line debugging? i have followed the steps on development hints for hacking on angular cli in the readme page and have my own copy of angular-cli. and i've put lots of ui.writeline commands everywhere to try to see how it all works. but i would be really great if i can step through line by line. i am using visual studio code - to debug an angular site, it's really easy. just need to point to the right port number in launch.json file. however, i'm unsure how to attach the debugger to the cli. thanks, wai
