 URL : "https://github.com/SRI-CSL/langlearn/issues/10" TITLE : test reset bug BODY : several events reset the testing process. we’ll want to fix these to prevent the participant from losing their progress accidentally. rotating the screen: i imagine screen locking the phone would solve this. leaving the app: clicking away using the home button and returning via the icon brings you to the initial screen, not where you last left off. allowing phone display to hibernate: oddly enough, this only seemed to occur on one of the nexus phones, and it wasn’t easy to replicate.
