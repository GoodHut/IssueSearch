 URL : "https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/issues/813" TITLE : gvrkeyboard text setter BODY : any chance we could get a setter for gvrkeyboard.editortext ? i manually added it and it works, would be nice to not have to add it anytime i update. c public string editortext { get { return instance != null ? instance.keyboardstate.editortext : string.empty; } set { keyboardprovider.editortext = value; } } i need this for a custom implementation of ui textfield interaction since inputfield s do not work.
