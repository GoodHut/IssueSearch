 URL : "https://github.com/andycasey/smhr/issues/242" TITLE : remove master line list BODY : @andycasey and i have decided that maintaining a master line list in smhr is way too much trouble. so we have decided to get rid of that and store atomic data individually with each spectral model/measurement. this should greatly speed up loading and saving, remove the unnecessary code for ensuring unique lines, reduce the size of the saved line lists, and allow e.g. editing loggf for individual lines in a synthesis. it sacrifices line consistency, but this is not something that we can robustly do on the fly, and it costs too much in code complexity. - update session and spectral_models to remove master line list - remove all references to line hashes - fix saving/loading measurement transitions - bundle all profile models into one list - save each synthesis linelist individually - write new measurement importer - fix default line list/measurements in session - write conversion script for old smhr files
