 URL : "https://github.com/rpocklin/angular-scroll-animate/issues/25" TITLE : when-visible from below BODY : it looks like it triggers when the start of the element is in view, based on delay-percent. however, it does not have an equal trigger when the end of the element is in view. for instance if i have a large div and scroll in from the bottom i need to be nearly at the top for this to work. a workaround is to set up two divs that trigger and work with the angular responses, but am i missing something for scrolling up/from below on long divs?
