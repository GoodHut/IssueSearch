 URL : "https://github.com/perl6/whateverable/issues/154" TITLE : benchable and used modules BODY : sometimes a module is needed in the executed code: https://github.com/perl6/whateverable/blob/master/benchable.p6 l63 and it goes a bit further and requires stuff like this: https://github.com/perl6/whateverable/blob/master/benchable.p6 l86 would be nice if we didn't have to do all this and the module was readily available by some other means.
