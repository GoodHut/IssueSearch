 URL : "https://github.com/ethereumjs/testrpc/issues/407" TITLE : --db option not working BODY : dear all, i am just in the process of testing the latest version of testrpc 4.1.3 and the --db option still appears to not be working correctly as reported in earlier versions by users. in summary, the chain data appears to be saved but when closing and starting testrpc again, my test contract is no longer deployed. has anyone been able to get this feature to work in v4.1.3? many thanks, pete
