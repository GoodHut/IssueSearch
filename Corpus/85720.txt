 URL : "https://github.com/kevinhughes27/parity-server/issues/200" TITLE : fix nick amlin sub s name BODY : nick amlin was added with sub manually added to his name and then s was added by the app. this isn't causing any issues now but is inconsistent with other subs which might cause issues down the line when we model subs properly. to fix we need to update the data and re-upload it. we can follow the week edit procedure in the readme
