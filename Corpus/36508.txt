 URL : "https://github.com/weaveworks/mesh/issues/72" TITLE : how to change peers? BODY : for alertmanager, we'd like to be able to update the set of peers in a gossip, based on discovered kubernetes pods. what's the right way to do this? currently, i'm doing something like go meshrouter.connectionmaker.initiateconnections peers, true where meshrouter is a mesh.router sub-questions: does this remove / disconnect old peers? does it add new ones? what happens to peers that remain present across updates? if peers includes the current node, what happens?
