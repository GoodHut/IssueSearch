 URL : "https://github.com/spullara/mustache.java/issues/191" TITLE : data for partials BODY : hello, i'm trying to use mustache together with jersey, but i'm experiencing a strange issue when using partials. jersey offers a module for mustache java so it works just fine, i can use partials as expected. to handle exceptions with jersey, you can specify an exceptionmapper, but these exceptionmappers don't support mustache, so i decided to create my own instance of a mustachefactory just for the exceptionmappers. and here's my issue: when using my own mustachefactory, partials aren't rendered as expected. for example: java mustachefactory mustachefactory = new defaultmustachefactory ; mustache mustache = mustachefactory.compile templates/sometemplate.mustache ; stringwriter stringwriter = new stringwriter ; mustache.execute stringwriter, immutablemap.of title , some title! ; system.out.println stringwriter.tostring ; header.mustache html <!doctype html> <html> <head> <title>{{ title }}</title> </head> <body> sometemplate.mustache html {{>templates/header}} <h1>this is mustacheee</h1> and a footer, but that's not important for now. the expected output would be html <!doctype html> <html> <head> <title>some title!</title> </head> <body> <h1>this is mustacheee</h1> but instead, the <title> tag is empty. as mentioned before, when using mustache with jersey, it works like a charm. does someone know, what the issue is? is there any way to specify data for partials in java ?
