 URL : "https://github.com/tvrenamer/tvrenamer/issues/143" TITLE : use java 8 time BODY : the original implementation of java.util.date left much to be desired. a third-party package, joda time, became very popular. as of java 8, this is integrated into the java core packages, with classes like localtime. i've integrated these into my branch. this does require java 8, though. let me know if you'd like to have these changes.
