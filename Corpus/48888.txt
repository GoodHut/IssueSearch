 URL : "https://github.com/ChrisMuir/comtradr/issues/1" TITLE : ssl certificate issue BODY : as of 2017-05-28, the core functions of this package are no longer working properly on windows machines, they fail with error message: error in curl::curl_fetch_memory url, handle = handle : peer certificate cannot be authenticated with given ca certificates which essentially means there's a ca certificate issue preventing curl from completing the connection. i believe the un site hosting the db is the issue, as there are issues with its ssl certificate per ssldecoder https://ssldecoder.org/?host=comtrade.un.org&port=&csr=&s= .
