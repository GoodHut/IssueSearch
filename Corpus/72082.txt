 URL : "https://github.com/NoryDev/hitchspots/issues/10" TITLE : automate data refreshing BODY : about data should be refreshed from hitchwiki automatically. here is a possible flow: - add missing spots - delete removed spots - update spots whose rating has changed this can be done with one area request to hitchwiki and comparing the data with db data. technical implementation - augment hitchwiki:refresh rake task to update spots whose rating has changed. ⚠️ need to check and probably modify the hitchspots::spot.update method encoding - schedule a cron job on heroku to run the task on a regular basis.
