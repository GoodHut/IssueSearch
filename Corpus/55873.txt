 URL : "https://github.com/muflihun/easyloggingpp/issues/499" TITLE : logging to temp folder BODY : i'm trying to log to a temp folder on windows. my configuration file is as follows: global: format = %level %datetime %msg filename = %temp%\test.log enabled = true to_file = true to_standard_output = false subsecond_precision = 3 performance_tracking = false max_log_file_size = 2097152 throw log files away after 2mb however, the log isn't saved in this location. is there a reason why easylogging doesn't support environment variables like %temp%? what is the recommended way to log to the users temp folder?
