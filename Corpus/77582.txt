 URL : "https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer4/issues/651" TITLE : no claim types requested BODY : i have just upgraded my host from beta5 to rtm. i also moved my persistence from the twentytwenty ef to the identityserver one. this involved making the change from scopes to apiresources and identityresources. its all gone smoothly and i have implemented the iresourcestore, iclientstore, iprofileservice. i have set up my identity resources with the identity scope names openid, profile and i am able to log into my client using my host, but only if i add a claim to any one of my identity resources. if there is no claim in any identity resource then i get the error 'no claim types requested' which is thrown from the constructor of profiledatarequestcontext. why is it a problem if i don't have any identity resource claims. if i add any random value as a identity resource claim, the authentication works perfectly and i get my identity and access tokens and my claims like sub and email and the like. is there something i have failed to do?
