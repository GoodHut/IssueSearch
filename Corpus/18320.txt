 URL : "https://github.com/wadewegner/sfdx-travisci/issues/7" TITLE : support for pr's? BODY : keen to give this whirl with my dlrs repo... it uses travis currently, but does have an issue with pr's since the encrypted login details are not copied over / available in pr's. i assume using scratch orgs and this approach that this will no longer be an issue? have you tried this with pr's? thanks! 👍
