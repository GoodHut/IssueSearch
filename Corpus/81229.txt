 URL : "https://github.com/kennethreitz/pipenv/issues/980" TITLE : weird behaviour with cwd BODY : i'm working on an pr to add pipfile support to anaconda 978. describe you environment 1. os type: os x 10.12.6 1. python version: $ python -v python 2.7.13 1. pipenv version: $ pipenv --version pipenv, version 8.2.7 expected result the following snippet run under python 3 should return the virtualenv's path: import subprocess dirname = '/users/user/dir1' sp = subprocess.popen 'pipenv', '--venv' , cwd=dirname, stdout=subprocess.pipe, stderr=subprocess.pipe sp_out, sp_err = sp.communicate print 'o:', repr sp_out , 'e:', repr sp_err , 'cwd:', repr dirname o: b'/users/user/.local/share/virtualenvs/dir1-pcefx-1b ' e: b'' cwd: '/users/user/dir1' actual result for one folder it works, for an other it doesn't. when it doesn't work it returns this: o: b'' e: b'no virtualenv has been created for this project yet! ' cwd: '/users/user/dir2' when running pipenv --venv from shell it works perfectly in both folders. no --verbose for --venv :- steps to replicate no idea, what is the difference between the two folders. copying the bad folder's pipfile to the good folder doesn't break the good folder. can you tell me how can i diagnose what is the difference between the two folders?
