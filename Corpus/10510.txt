 URL : "https://github.com/Arachni/arachni/issues/831" TITLE : cli only package BODY : have you thought about making a cli only package. i use your product in a cicd such as jenkins inside docker containers which i can forward to you if you want and i dont have any use for any of the ui portions. i do like the reporter function so i wouldn't want any of that to go, but a more slimmed down working version of cli only would be great and make my docker container much smaller. if this is something you are looking for a collaborator on i would work on it with you. i would just need to figure out which components can be safely removed and still allow the cli portions to function.
