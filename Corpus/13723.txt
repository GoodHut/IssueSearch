BODY : hey, i have a small model to solve a multi classification problem. while training and testing the model accuracy is around ~0.96, but when i check the prediction of the model, it seems to be very wrong... top_words = 5000 max_review_length = 600 embedding_vector_length = 64 model = sequential model.add embedding top_words, embedding_vector_length, input_length=max_review_length, dropout=0.2 model.add dropout 0.2 model.add lstm 100,input_shape= 1, x_train.shape 2 model.add dropout 0.2 model.add dense 30, activation='sigmoid' model.compile loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics= 'accuracy' model.fit x_train, y_train, nb_epoch=1, batch_size=64 scores = model.evaluate x_test, y_test print %s: %.2f%% % model.metrics_names 1 , scores 1 100 preds = model.predict x_test print preds :5 print y_test :5
