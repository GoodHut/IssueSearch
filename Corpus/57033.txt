 URL : "https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-react/issues/948" TITLE : people picker question BODY : i am working on adding a people picker component and i was wondering if there is an official or supported way to handle searching for the users. i have seen examples where you send the text input to a rest call that searches the user profile service. on the http://dev.office.com/fabric /components/peoplepicker page, the example only shows pulling in example data from a people import so i wasn't sure what you guys typically use in a real world environment to pull in and filter the user info. any help would be greatly appreciated.
