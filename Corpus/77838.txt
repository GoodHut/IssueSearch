 URL : "https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/issues/664" TITLE : on the opinionated rules BODY : i understand that normalize isn't a classical css reset but the removing those that you call _opinionated rules_ is harsh. it's 2017 everybody is setting their box sizing to border-box. leaving the body margin? how many websites don't have this set to zero? for me normalize is considered a reset for the non useful stuff like the body margin and a way to make the different browsers behave consistently. i don't really like the new update and i am sure that there is a lot who disagree with it. currently the stuff that i could spot was: - removing box-sizing setting to border-box - removing setting the body margin to 0 - removing setting the font family to sans-serif i wonder if you can share with us a more detailed list of the removed features. for now i think i am sticking the projects i am working on to version 5.0 and i am sure that the frameworks that depends on normalize will do the same.
