 URL : "https://github.com/Esri/geoportal-server-catalog/issues/56" TITLE : explain the map tab better BODY : currently, when i open the map tab and click on map search, the catalogs offered are 'caliornia geoportal', 'geoportal sandbox', and 'usgin geoportal'. i don't see the catalog that the server application is attached to; shouldn't that be the default. is there any documentation on what the map tab is supposed to to and how to confgure the search to use the active catalog by default? i see nothing in the wiki. thanks
