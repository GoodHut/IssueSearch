 URL : "https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr/issues/1463" TITLE : getter for learner note BODY : it would be great to have a getter for the learner note. right now we can only access the note by typing lrn = makelearner regr.glmnet lrn$note and this looks quite chaotic to me: 1 factors automatically get converted to dummy columns, ordered factors to integer. parameter s value of the regularization parameter used for predictions is set to 0.1 by default, but needs to be tuned by the user. but i think a getter would solve the appearance stuff. although the tutorial lists the learner notes in the list of integrated learners, i couldn't find anything there and neither in the help pages telling the user to look at the learner note and how to do that. since the note is quite important we should tell the user that he/she really should take a look at the learner's note before getting started with the fitting process.
