 URL : "https://github.com/guard/listen/issues/423" TITLE : question: long polling? BODY : hi, the app i'm writing could benefit from listen, but it would be used on a long polling window. is there any performance or output impact to having an extremely long polling time, like an hour or day? if a file is created or modified and then deleted, does it get an entry in both arrays? if a file is edited multiple times in the polling window, does it get multiple entries? thanks, -dan
