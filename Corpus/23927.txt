 URL : "https://github.com/vjeantet/hugo-theme-docdock/issues/29" TITLE : reverse alpha sort BODY : i'm trying to sort out how to sort entries, so that the most recent documents end up at the top. the hardest way to do this is with the 'weight=' parameter, though i could do it by computing a weight for the first entry at some large number and then count backwards. by default the sort order is a-z, my documents naturally want to sort z-a, i don't see an easy way to do that in a directive.
