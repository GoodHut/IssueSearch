 URL : "https://github.com/tsherif/picogl.js/issues/86" TITLE : handling context lost BODY : after reviewing more closely the structure of the library i realized even with the app class keeping the gl state you would still need to recreate a lot of your classes example would be creating a new framebuffer . i guess i don't expect picogl to handle it all itself since its going to be application specific, and i know the browser will eventually come and clean out my unused constructed classes, but wondering if an example or helper functions to nuke stuff would be worth it as to my knowledge there are good and bad ways of efficiently handling restarting everything
