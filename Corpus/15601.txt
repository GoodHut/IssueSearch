BODY : i started to play with your library, but can't found any example how to write something to btle device. i started my experiments from your temperature example and done some modifications, at the end of example i changed gatt.connect_blocking argv 1 ; for ;; gatt.read_and_process_next ; into: gatt.connect_blocking 5c:f8:21:f9:80:bd ; char data = !! rth\x0c ; while done == false { gatt.read_and_process_next ; } gatt.send_write_request 0x12, const uint8_t data, strlen data ; gatt.write_and_process_next ; while true { gatt.read_and_process_next ; } it works, but the structure is quite ugly. i also use variable done placed in discover characteristic callback to determine if i'm connected and have all characteristic enumerated. i didn't find a way to do it in more elegant way, but i got often exeption error trying to issue command mid state is there any set of functions which i can use to determine where i can do read/write to not cause this exception?
