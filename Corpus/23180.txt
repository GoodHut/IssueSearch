 URL : "https://github.com/alfred82santa/dirty-models/issues/100" TITLE : now datetime field BODY : it might be a nice addition to allow a datetimefield field to default to datetime.now . if i do e.g: class testmodel basemodel : created = datetimefield default=datetime.now a = testmodel b = testmodel a.created == b.created true which i wouldn't expect. obviously it is trivial to give now to the model creation instead. a more generic way would be to add a default_f argument to basefield which takes a function that is run when the model is created. see this no longer maintained similar project https://github.com/jeffjenkins/mongoalchemy/blob/f1ee35a0856212a11f73ba561bb3344662ca3524/mongoalchemy/fields/base.py l143 .
