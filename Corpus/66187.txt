 URL : "https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/issues/6522" TITLE : mbl and eeprom settings BODY : when using mesh bed leveling and saving the settings to eeprom not the full mbl.status is saved, but rather only the has_mesh bit. this results in the printer forgetting about mbl beeing turned on. solutions could be to save the full status integer eeprom waste? or storing the mbl.is_active bit instead of the mbl.has_mesh bit and when loading assuming that there is a mesh when mbl is active. another thing concerning mbl: maybe there should be a hint, that mbl and manual_probing should not be enabled at the same time.
