 URL : "https://github.com/sunjay/turtle/issues/47" TITLE : make all links permanent BODY : all over the code documentation we have links like this: https://github.com/sunjay/turtle/blob/1476e1a3e32e87db74c770d149c055aed8660dad/src/turtle.rs l62-l64 or this: https://github.com/sunjay/turtle/blob/1476e1a3e32e87db74c770d149c055aed8660dad/src/turtle.rs l680-l682 the problem with linking directly to master or gh-pages is that those links will break if we ever move the files or put them somewhere else. instead, we should link directly to a ref that contains those images. 1. to do that, go to the github page for each image e.g. for https://github.com/sunjay/turtle/raw/master/forward.gif , the github url is https://github.com/sunjay/turtle/blob/master/forward.gif 2. click on the short hash for the latest commit and copy the full hash from the url e.g. for forward.gif , the short hash was 17bf90d and the full hash was 17bf90d65abf51bb46549bf5036c8f284ed1b4de ! screenshot from 2017-12-20 13-11-44 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/530939/34226713-c91fb1a0-e587-11e7-905e-1793d486cc5d.png 3. replace master or gh-pages in the original image url with the full hash e.g. for forward.gif , this results in https://github.com/sunjay/turtle/raw/17bf90d65abf51bb46549bf5036c8f284ed1b4de/forward.gif 4. test that the link still works 5. replace the link in the source with the now permanent link there may be other non-image links too that link directly to master or gh-pages. these should all be updated.
