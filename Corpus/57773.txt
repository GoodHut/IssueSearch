 URL : "https://github.com/dscottbuch/cTiVo/issues/231" TITLE : remote access for tivo BODY : just wanted to ask a hopefully basic question to see if ctivo was designed for a user to be able to access/download from a tivo when they're not on their home network. because while at home, i can connect just fine even when i'm technically not on the same network as the tivo . when i leave, though, the program spins for a while and ultimately cannot connect. i figured i should start with the simplest question to figure out if this is intended, or not.
