 URL : "https://github.com/OPLBPO/opl_storybook/issues/14" TITLE : content for january BODY : happy new year @csimmons44 ! i was wondering if you could forward me the content that will be included for the january chapter of the food literacy storybook. i believe this includes: - main title of chapter - short video on loop at the top - article - youtube videos - podcasts - images separate or part of a gallery - collections of books, recipes - twitter, facebook, instagram accounts that the feature should use to share the page - bg image behind credits at the bottom of page let me know if i've missed a content type in the list above. if you could zip up two folders - one for french and one for english, that would be great. i wanted to try placing everything in on the page as you would and create a step by step guide using the material. in future months you would refer to the guide to create the storybook pages. does that sound good to you? i'd like to have this to you for friday to review and start testing / playing around with. in the future, which team at the library will be responsible for adding the content?
