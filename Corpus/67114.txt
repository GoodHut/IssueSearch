 URL : "https://github.com/ITS-UofIowa/sitenow_standard_lab_theme/issues/24" TITLE : organize theme settings BODY : there are a lot of custom theme settings for the lab theme, and the settings page is a little overwhelming right now. some of the settings which are currently check boxes cannot be applied at the same time but this isn't being validated . i am proposing that the settings be separated into more field sets, and where it makes sense to use radios instead of check boxes for either/or settings. this is a rough draft of how the form could be organized, with the header background image settings displaying only if the header background image toggle box is checked. ! theme_settings https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1282401/22441732/3f8a10f8-e6fe-11e6-8670-cacd0b023394.jpeg
