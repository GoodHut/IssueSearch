 URL : "https://github.com/SockDrawer/StoryBB/issues/129" TITLE : erroneous post counts BODY : at http://forums.crossroads-rp.com/index.php?board=1.0, both threads are listed as having 20 replies, but there's only three posts in the entire board. this also seems to have a knock-on effect on the in-thread pager, which claims two pages when there's only one or two posts. maybe a data issue?
