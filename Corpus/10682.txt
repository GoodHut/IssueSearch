 URL : "https://github.com/opendatakit/opendatakit/issues/1268" TITLE : csv exports fail BODY : hello, i exported my data sets on jan 30, and then we got a ton more submissions from our health workers. now every export attempt fails. i have no idea why. not sure if this has anything to do with it, but there are many months worth of data less than 500 entries . i haven't figured out how to delete the old data en masse and if i try to delete them individually, eventually i exceed my quota and i'm locked out. any suggestions?
