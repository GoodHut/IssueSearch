 URL : "https://github.com/dino/dino/issues/20" TITLE : message archive management BODY : finally, a modern, good looking, easy client that i can install on non-nerd pcs. already now it works like a charme, thanks a lot! not sure, whether i should open issues about missing functionality, because the program is still in its early stage and i'm sure you have a list of stuff floating somewhere around. maybe you colud add this list here to github, potentially as issues? but anyway, i'll open this one. i logged in into my account and found the last 20 or so messages from the mucs i'm in. i guess, this was not due to message archive management, as i can't scroll up more. also, i did not receive history from single user chats. so, feature request: please implement message archive management.
