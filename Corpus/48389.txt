 URL : "https://github.com/someara/kitchen-dokken/issues/81" TITLE : run custom base image BODY : i'm interested in using my own custom base image with dokken. we maintain a small amount of base images that have things like java or ruby, etc, pre-installed on them, along with a few other things, and would like to take advantage of this, even if i were to have to extend, so to speak, our base images into a custom version for dokken that would be ok. is there documentation anywhere on what would need to be done to do this?
