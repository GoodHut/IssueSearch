 URL : "https://github.com/jetty-project/jetty-alpn-agent/issues/7" TITLE : add logging controls BODY : we've recently integrated this agent into https://github.com/playframework/playframework. it would be nice if there was a way to control how the agent logs debug information. we would like to minimise the amount of information that our users see, so that they can focus on errors. at the moment the util.log method prints directly to stderr code https://github.com/jetty-project/jetty-alpn-agent/blob/9b8b34b2f265c4c47e7c1c30e5fc283f8c491425/src/main/java/org/mortbay/jetty/alpn/agent/util.java l21 . instead of always logging, would it be possible to have the agent read a system property and only enable debug logging if the property is set?
