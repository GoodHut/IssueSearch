 URL : "https://github.com/shamansir/rpd/issues/447" TITLE : pan and zoom? BODY : i'd really like to use this for a project, but with the editor embedded in a resizable panel in my main view. for that to work with a nice user experience, i need pan/zoom so you can zoom to an appropriate level to edit the part of the patch you care about. i tried to implement it monkeypatched in using d3.zoom behavior on the container , but unfortunately it seems that the node drag-to-move events interfere with the behavior i'd like to achieve. i think it'd be hard to implement without access to the internals.
