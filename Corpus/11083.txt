 URL : "https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv-build/issues/83" TITLE : ffmpeg not found BODY : hi, when ./rebuild -j4 libass and ffmpeg are compiled correctly but once it reach the mpv-config, this one fails, stating that it can't find ffmpeg: > unable to find development files for some of the required ffmpeg/libav libraries. you need at least ffmpeg 3.2.2 or libav 12. aborting. ffmpeg is properly compiled and available in mpv-build/ffmpeg_build headers seems available in mpv-build/build_libs/include/ binaries are in mpv-build/build_libs/bin/ and .a are found in mpv-build/build_libs/lib/ so i don't understand why mpv-config fail to find it.. is there a path trick or something ? thanks !
