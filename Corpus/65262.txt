 URL : "https://github.com/biopython/biopython/issues/1288" TITLE : improving test coverage BODY : we have for some time run the continuous integration tests on travisci via the python tool coverage and uploaded the metrics to https://codecov.io/github/biopython/biopython/ for biopython 1.69 the test coverage reported was about 80%, as we approach biopython 1.70 we are now up to 84%. this has been a combination of removing some deprecated code, and adding more tests - including efforts like 820 for moving the remaining self-tests blocks under bio/ into our test framework under tests/ where those tests will be run regularly via continuous integration. note that currently our travisci configuration deliberately does not include the online tests we are using python run_tests.py --offline , and due to installation time overheads does not have all the optional dependencies installed. this means the numbers on codecov.io are in a sense under-reporting our potential true test coverage. i would like us to improve the coverage further - the sunburst image from codecov.io which takes into account the lines of code and percentage coverages highlights particular targets including bio.nexus , bio.codonalign , bio.kegg , bio.popgen .
