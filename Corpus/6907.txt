 URL : "https://github.com/shipping-docker/php-app/issues/26" TITLE : ci with jenkins BODY : thank you very much for this course. i have been following each video but i however got lost at the jenkins part. i was unable to understand the alternative process if your github account is not an organisation. in my case, i have a private repository which i pay for and i am unable to upgrade to an organisation where i would have to fork out $25. does the github authentication plugin work with repositories only? if so, how different will the workflow be apart from what you showed in the video? thanks!
