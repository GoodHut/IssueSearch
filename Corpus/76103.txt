 URL : "https://github.com/theCrag/website/issues/2544" TITLE : index tree ui discussion BODY : does anyone else feel that the dropdowns on the index tree are in the wrong places? i feel that the one to the right of a region should have the daughters of that region, and the left the siblings. as it is the right doesn't exist at the current level, the left is the daughters, and you have to go another one to the left to get to siblings. it seems more intuitive for me at least to restructure them.
