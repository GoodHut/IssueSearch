 URL : "https://github.com/joranvanpol/bwa-u4-feature-request/issues/1" TITLE : feature request review BODY : adding recommendations based on what the user already added will improve the user's experience. good job on researching the spotify end-point api's. i would strongly recommend creating a new component similar to searchresults called searchrecommendations for example. that way if you want to remove the feature, you can just remove that component without touching the other components. in terms of user interface being busy, we could toggle the recommendation display on/off. work on the core feature first before adding the option to preview the song. the feature request is feasible and practical.
