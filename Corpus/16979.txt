 URL : "https://github.com/nystudio107/seomatic/issues/276" TITLE : more social media BODY : i really like how i can configure all my social media stuff in one place, but every site seems to come up with some new ones. latest site has dribble and behance. maybe you could have a table on the seomatic social media tab where we could enter those additional random ones.
