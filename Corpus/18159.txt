 URL : "https://github.com/mozilla/missy-elephant/issues/5" TITLE : sort user stories BODY : all the personas from the workweek are now in this doc https://docs.google.com/a/mozilla.com/presentation/d/1v5njbzxgjpnw3ggz5jz1iid22kolo-9r6rghzo1lgjo/edit?usp=sharing . since they were sorted by name, i was able to add the berlin workweek users stories https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/cossberlinuserstories to the personas. but the hawaii users stories https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/network-software-groups are all all taped onto the large paper personas, @a-kilroy can you please sort and add them into the doc? i remember there were a few personas that had a lot of the same users stories, could you also point out which ones those where?
