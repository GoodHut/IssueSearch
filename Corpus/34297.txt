BODY : running jitsi meet version 1.0.2098-1 in chromium 59.0.3071.86 with two cameras: one laptop's camera and one v4l2loopback. jitsi meet chooses the laptop camera by default. in settings->device settings i see two cameras, both showing correct preview. hovewer when i choose the dummy video device , it still uses the laptop camera. the loopback camera only gets chosen when the real camera is unavailable rmmod uvcvideo . if i connect second camera to usb it also gets ignored. the camera choice in device settings doesn't seem to affect anything.
