 URL : "https://github.com/angular/material2/issues/4278" TITLE : can't drag md-slider BODY : bug, feature request, or proposal: looks like a bug, but it could be user error i'm new to material what is the expected behavior? should be able to drag on md-slider what is the current behavior? drag doesn't work, though click on slider does set the value what are the steps to reproduce? please check out http://ravinutala.com/d/index.html for an example with just the slider what is the use-case or motivation for changing an existing behavior? just want the correct behavior, not asking for any changes which versions of angular, material, os, browsers are affected? angular 4.0.3, material 2.0.0-beta.3, windows 10, chrome/ff only tested on these two is there anything else we should know? i was wondering if this had something to do with hammer.js, which i'm including in the module and also tried to load on index.html, but i still see this behavior.
