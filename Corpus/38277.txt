 URL : "https://github.com/Kode/Kha/issues/677" TITLE : outdated xna backend BODY : looks like the xna backend is out of date: <https://github.com/kode/kha/tree/master/backends/xna/kha/xna> are there plans to continue supporting this platform? if i may make a suggestion, since xna is now dead, monogame is a current implementation of the xna apis. maybe this could be a monogame/c backend instead. but the latest monogame is now using sdl2 anyway, so it might be unnecessary to target another abstraction layer. i'm not sure, but i think that sdl2 is comparable to kore?
