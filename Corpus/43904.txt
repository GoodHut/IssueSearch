 URL : "https://github.com/hautelook/AliceBundle/issues/331" TITLE : do not truncate views BODY : within my database i have some views and defined them as read-only for doctrine. anyways the hautelook:fixtures:load with or without --purge-with-truncate tries to truncate or delete the views. this shouldn't happen as views only gather information and can not be truncated. neither shall they be deleted as your bundle won't bring them up afterwards. how to exclude this view? will it be built in to check if a table is a view or not? why does this bundle even try to remove this table? i didn't mention it in any fixture.
