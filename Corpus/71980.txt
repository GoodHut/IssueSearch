BODY : i just wanted to take a moment to say thank you, to the people who have worked on this project, and continue to help improve it daily. i think bill schumacher has been doing a terrific job of maintaining the repository, and hope he continues to lay down the framework for this useful tool. i think there is much more in store for emokit, and we have a lot of great minds out there who are making use of this toolkit. perhaps there could be a wiki entry, that showcases the many ways that people are utilizing the emokit project... as it might help inspire new ideas in others. i know just a few days ago, i had someone interested in a project that would turn led lights on, interfaced with an arduino pi controller. projects like that, might be a useful showcase, of what is possible with emokit. emokit helps give us a glimpse into the wonderful workings of the mind, i think it'd also be great if there was a wiki, for the research we might glean through this project like how to evaluate the signals we receive. heres to 2017, may it be a productive year for the future of emokit.
