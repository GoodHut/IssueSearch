 URL : "https://github.com/panuhorsmalahti/gulp-tslint/issues/102" TITLE : output to html file BODY : i saw this closed issue https://github.com/panuhorsmalahti/gulp-tslint/issues/32 and wondered if there was a way to get a html report produced? the link in that closed issue seems to reference an older line of code in the suggestions offered. in gulp-eslint i can do: javascript .pipe plugins.eslint.format 'html', function results { fs.writefilesync path.join paths.reports, 'eslint-report.html' , results ; } is there anything similar that can be done with this module? thanks
