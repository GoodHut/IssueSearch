 URL : "https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/issues/3371" TITLE : cc3d led strip BODY : using st link v2 programmer and swd port cc3d board has been flashed with betaflight 3.1.7 openpilot bl removed . led strip, configured as enabled, does not recognize leds 0 remaining . flashing bf 2.9 led strip works and shows 4 remaining. i looked into using docker to try to build a cc3d build based on 3.1.7 with led strip but i have had no success. is there any way to get a 3.1.7 bf build for cc3d with led strip support? i'm sure this board is looked at as old/eol but it still works and so i would like to run it in the ground before replacing. many thanks.
