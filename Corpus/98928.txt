 URL : "https://github.com/ProjectResound/planning/issues/88" TITLE : loading state for explorer BODY : when the user first visits resound after logging in, they may see a blank explorer state, with no audio files being listed. when the server returns with the audio files, then it gets populated. depending on connection speed, this may take a half second or more. in the meantime, we should probably have some sort of loading messaging. ac: - user is not confused on why there are no audio files listed, during times of slow connections
