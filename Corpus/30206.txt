 URL : "https://github.com/skyarkhangel/Hardcore-SK/issues/647" TITLE : odd behavior & misc BODY : some weird things i notice that dont seem to have much or any reference. - colonists will stop research and ignore research tables until the research tree queue is changed/shuffled. - meals or objects colonists are supposed to put in their inventory to eat away from the colony are repeatedly picked up and dropped on the floor. the task description is taking jerky or something instead of hauling jerky . from what i can gather from issue 137 it seems the last problem lies somewhere within combat realism? i understand russian better when i hear it than when i read it but, i think jnkyacc was pointing out that meals need to be allowed into the loadout somehow? with no workaround given i began playing with files and was able to stop the crazy behavior myself thankfully and the colonists even started packing meals in their inventory correctly to my surprise :p i cannot find any solution to the colonists abruptly stopping their research and ignoring research tables anywhere here or from poking around in the game files. was not a problem prior to removing the original research button. if this info is apparent already i apologize.
