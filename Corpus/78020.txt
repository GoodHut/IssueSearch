 URL : "https://github.com/Alexpux/MINGW-packages/issues/2784" TITLE : parallel build for boost BODY : boost uses its own build system, which doesn't respect makeflags, so it is difficult to pass a -j nproc to it, while here it would make a lot of sense. it would be nice to have a way for parallel builds to work, e.g. by isolating a -j option from makeflags and passing it on to b2.
