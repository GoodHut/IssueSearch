 URL : "https://github.com/mooncoincore/wallet/issues/5" TITLE : compiling - question BODY : hi vassili, thanks for the new mooncoin-wallet. i've got a question. while compiling, the following was displayed: balloon/balloonpow.c: in function 'balloonpow_hash': balloon/balloonpow.c:29:25: warning: passing argument 2 of 'hash_state_extract' discards 'const' qualifier from pointer target type hash_state_extract &s,output ; ^ in file included from balloon/balloonpow.c:11:0: balloon/hash_state.h:48:5: note: expected 'uint8_t ' but argument is of type 'const void ' int hash_state_extract const struct hash_state s, uint8_t out block_size ; i thought the balloonhash was abandoned altogether, so why does it still occur on the compilation-process? thanks and best regards
