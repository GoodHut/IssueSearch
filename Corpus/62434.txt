 URL : "https://github.com/convox/rack/issues/1841" TITLE : code sync with env vars BODY : alexp 6:26 am hi everyone, i'm seeing some unexpected behavior with convox's code sync feature. i've narrowed it down to usage of env values in some of the dockerfile instructions. for example, something like this: env app_home=/my-service workdir $app_home
copy . $app_home results in files copied to the literal value of the directory in the copy command above. meaning, files end up in /my-service/$app_home/... it seems that variable interpolation is not supported by the code sync feature. is this expected, or am i doing something that's a bit off? 6:30 hmmm, i just found this: https://github.com/convox/rack/issues/1055 . although i am running 20170119233025, which is newer than the version that has that fix. edited https://trello.com/c/isvckarw/434-code-sync-with-env-vars
