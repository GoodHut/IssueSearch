 URL : "https://github.com/f4exb/sdrangel/issues/74" TITLE : 10 mhz lock BODY : is it possible to add the ability to use external 10 mhz to lock the limesdr in sdrangel? we're looking at using the lime on 3.4 ghz eme. jt65 transmit/receive is working, but accurate frequency stability would be a big plus! i have used an external 10 mhz reference but it must be set up in limesuitegui and it's not permanent. it resets to internal reference with a power cycle. mike
