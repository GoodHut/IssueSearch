BODY : the boss got killed by the add packs coming down, way to fast. i think he got killed after 1,5mins without the elite packs spawning on the web we did not even activate the event i think . the group i was in tried to skip, but the guy was already dead when we got down there. can't really say much about how it happened, i think the waves may have started way before we finished the first boss.
