 URL : "https://github.com/commons-app/apps-android-commons/issues/559" TITLE : release to chrome store BODY : i move recent pictures from my phone to my computer every week/month because of storage space limitations. then to upload the interesting pictures to commons i use apps like vicu√±a https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/category:mediawiki_upload_tools . problem: in some cases the commons mobile app is more efficient than these desktop apps ex: guessing category from latitude/longitude . so, it would be great if we could use the app on desktop. i tried generating a chrome extension from the apk using twerk, but the resulting extension loads forever.
