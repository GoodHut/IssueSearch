 URL : "https://github.com/kartoza/geosafe/issues/32" TITLE : ephemeral analysis extent BODY : cristiano: > i'm guessing manually drawing hazard extents is already on the wish list for new features, but does that have to happen on the geonode side first, or maybe it could also be done with less persistent polygons only valid for each session ? tim: > yes i think having ephemeral polygons drawn in the geosafe ui might be a good thing to add for analysis extents. proposed solution in addition to existing analysis extent options, add the ability for the user to draw a polygon that will just last the session.
