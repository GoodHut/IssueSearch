 URL : "https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-library/issues/1833" TITLE : fp-lib-tables out of date BODY : hi, i just noticed, that fp-lib-table in template directory does not contain all fp libraries and some of them are no longer valid. 89 vs 114 entries is there some automated way how to update them or is it done manually?
