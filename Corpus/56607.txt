 URL : "https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync/issues/555" TITLE : no output on odroid c2 BODY : hello. first, thank you for this open source developing. now, to my problem. i am running dietpi on an odroid c2. i installed shairport-sync through dietpi it has a soft optimized installer which enables something like one-click installation . now, i can see my device from itunes and spotify and apparently send audio to it , but there is no output. i could only make it work the first time i tried using itunes. from that poing on, there was no audio. i read all the readme.md and trooubleshooting, but found nothing that could help me. what did come to my attention is that i didn't find the config file at the supposed location etc/shairport-sync.conf . i don't have great knowledge of linux/arm arch so if you can point me in the right direction to solve this, it would be great. let me know if i can paste some logs or something to add more information. thanxs
