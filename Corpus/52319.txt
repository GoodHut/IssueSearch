 URL : "https://github.com/MrLuit/MyEtherWalletWhitehat/issues/1" TITLE : check validity of keys BODY : your generateprivatekey function generates a private key based on just letters and numbers. the people that are getting these random keys can easily check if this is a valid key or not and then move on to the next one. a cleaner approach to this would be to use web3 https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/ to generate an a public-private key pair and set that as the private key you send off. i'll try fixing that in a few hours and i'll submit a pr if it works.
