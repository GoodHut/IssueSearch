 URL : "https://github.com/ericelliott/cuid/issues/84" TITLE : need to point to bundles BODY : because the popular bundling tools don't bundle stuff from node_modules our package.json should point to bundled versions of the library, instead of individual modules. i've tried doing this with browserify, but then webpack gives weird warnings to all the users of our module i think -- it used to, anyway . we could try to accomplish this with rollup https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/rolled-libraries/ . cc @markherhold @gmaclennan
