 URL : "https://github.com/gizak/termui/issues/131" TITLE : inline ansi color codes BODY : i'm passing in a string containing ansi color codes to a termui.table . the intent is to color individual cells rather than the entire row. the output from the table prints part of the escape sequence rather than the color: 32mexample 0m does termui.table need to be initialized a certain way to render escape sequences? apologies if this is an rtfm issue. i wasn't able to find anything in the docs.
