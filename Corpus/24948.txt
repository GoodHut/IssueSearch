 URL : "https://github.com/android-dtf/core_dex_db/issues/1" TITLE : update classsearch BODY : original posting: classsearch will be restructured to be more flexible and easy to use. it will be renamed as dexsearch going forward. one such inprovement, is the ability to search frameworks/apps for strings per capabilities added here: https://github.com/jakev/dexdumpsql/commit/d1367335af64af017529858be0bd0f11285f09a9 . analyst$ dtf dexsearch --apps --hasstring sys\.persist --------- i've been using a local dexsearch , the module that will ultimately replace classsearch , and i think i've decided on a format i want to use. dexsearch will support the following sub commands: - s tring - search for a string - f ield - search for a field - c lass - search for a class - m ethod - search for a method each of these will provide options to make it more powerful. for example, searching for the method openfile in a class that implements contentprovider: $ dtf dexsearch m openfile --class-imp contentprovider -----------------
