 URL : "https://github.com/molovo/zvm/issues/3" TITLE : install.man step fails BODY : on my system macos 10.12.3 and travis's trusty build, the install.man step of zsh's install procedure fails to finish, as the produced man files are all 0 bytes. it could be as simple as a missing dependency, but it means that zvm install $version returns an error, when zsh itself has been built successfully. not sure of a way to get around this - we could compile the install.bin , install.modules and install.fns steps separately, bypassing the man step so that the build can pass, and then install the man files ourselves from source.
