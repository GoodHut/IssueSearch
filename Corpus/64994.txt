 URL : "https://github.com/demostf/demos.tf/issues/5" TITLE : icons slightly too high BODY : first i just wanna mention that this is one of the best things ever made for tf2 imo. so me reporting even minor issues is not to discourage you but just to give you as much feedback as possible. i just watched a granary demo and the icons appear to be a bit higher on the online demo than actually in-game. i don't know if this is only on granary or also on other maps. thanks for making this! :d
