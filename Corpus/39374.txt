 URL : "https://github.com/elmsln/elmsln/issues/1729" TITLE : section save timeout BODY : bug: - v0.6.3 when saving a section after editing from the course outline /cis/section-list this will timeout on courses with a massive amount of students as described in 1271 i think the timeout is due to it trying to sync all the students ? but this isn't required anymore since this should be done from the cis now. i have a section where i want to switch the instructional outline from one book to the other, but the section size is massive in terms of students, so it's unable to save.
