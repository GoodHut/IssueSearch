 URL : "https://github.com/DanielnetoDotCom/YouPHPTube/issues/6" TITLE : saving shanges issue BODY : i'm having problems saving the configuration, the initial config went fine but updates when we save, the saving popup apears and stays on screen forever. i check the code and realize its related with this 2 lines in /objects/configuration.php . ffmpegmp4portrait = '{$global 'mysqli' ->real_escape_string $this->getffmpegmp4portrait }', . ffmpegwebmportrait = '{$global 'mysqli' ->real_escape_string $this->getffmpegwebmportrait }', i did not change the values in the config page so i'm testing with the default ones. also, one sugestion about upload files, when a file is uploaded the system starts encoding immediately, that is fine when we upload only one file, i have uploaded 5 files at the same time and the server went 100% cpu because its was encoding all files at the same time. it would be nice if the encoding was be made by upload order one at a time, or an option in the configuration to select the number of encondings we want at same time. regards
