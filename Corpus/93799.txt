 URL : "https://github.com/mozilla/django-session-csrf/issues/43" TITLE : arbitrary session fixation BODY : the middleware will echo any received value of the anoncsrf cookie in the set-cookie response as there seems to be no validation its value. this is a bit similar to a session fixation attack but i can't think of an easy way of exploiting this because the cookie must be already there - the ability of echoing an arbitrary string could however be used in some attacks against tls and possibly dos. request: cookie: anoncsrf=%0d%0a%00asd response: set-cookie: anoncsrf=%0d%0a%00asd; expires=fri, 28-apr-2017 16:10:05 gmt; httponly; max-age=3600; path=/; secure the following code should probably not echo the cookie value if it wasn't set by the server or at least validate its lenght and charset: if use_anon_cookie: if anon_cookie in request.cookies: key = request.cookies anon_cookie ... if use_anon_cookie: set or reset the cache and cookie timeouts. response.set_cookie anon_cookie, key, max_age=anon_timeout, httponly=true, secure=request.is_secure https://github.com/mozilla/django-session-csrf/blob/master/session_csrf/__init__.py l151
