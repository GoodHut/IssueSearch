 URL : "https://github.com/Victory-Game-Studios/Oldentide/issues/45" TITLE : make server thread-safe BODY : now that we have a thread pool and multiple threads, we need to make sure that all global variables used between is properly wrapped with a semaphore i'm looking at you, gamestate.cpp... players, sessions, etc. . there are other things that may need protection as well. do the socket-related things need to be wrapped with semaphores? the sqlite db maybe not because of atomic operations ? we need to identify what are the global variables shared between threads, and what is on each thread's stack. when a thread is created, anything not on the stack is shared, right? what about objects? i'm having a hard time wrapping my head around what is being shared and what isn't. are all objects created with new shared between threads, and all other objects strings, etc. not?
