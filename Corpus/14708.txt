 URL : "https://github.com/dwyl/hq/issues/367" TITLE : build our own cms BODY : there isn't currently a phoenix cms. using a cms written in another language isn't going to play well with phoenix and will undoubtably lead to nasty code https://github.com/ldmw/app/blob/master/web/controllers/resources.ex which won't be the most maintainable plus inefficiencies in how we make our queries and we won't have that much control with how our database is optimised for our phoenix apps seeing how phoenix optimises this through model relations is really useful and we are wasting it with other cms implementations . building a cms in phoenix won't be _that_ difficult. once built we will be able to make new views/edit views really fast phoenix's implementation through generators seems much simpler and more powerful than other cms implementations wagtail doesn't even come close from working with wagtail, i honestly feel that we would be much better off implementing our own cms and feel that it would be well worth our time building it
