 URL : "https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee/issues/3658" TITLE : exif tag usercomment BODY : hello, i started to work with rawtherapee 5.0-gtk3 64-bit on a windows 7 64-bit system. i never worked with older versions of rawtherapee. congratulations to this version. i assigned the 2 tags exif:usercomment and also exif:imagedescription to a .orf image and stored the output as .jpg file. both tags contained ascii characters and also some chinese characters. in order to check the written metadata, i also assigned the identical tags with exiftool 10.41 and have seen the following: - imagedescription has been written in identical form by exiftool and by rawtherapee. tag-values encoded in utf8. - usercomment has been stored differently: exiftool wrote: unicode followed by tag-value encoded in ucs2 rawtherapee wrote: ascii followed by tag-value encoded in utf8 the mwg 2.0 specification says: utf-8 is only recommended for string-type tags, not for tags like usercomment which specify an encoding. the mwg spec says: exif tags such as usercomment that have an encoding prefix should be written as ascii if all bytes fit in the 7-bit range 0..127, and must be written in some other encoding if any byte is outside the 7-bit range . so for me rawtherapee is wrong according to the specification. best regards herb
