 URL : "https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/issues/1497" TITLE : pipeline name limitations BODY : currently pipeline names cannot be longer than 64 characters, because we use pipeline names in rc replication controller names and those can't be longer than 64 characters. i'm not sure if this limitation is documented anywhere so we might want to do that. furthermore, we might want to come up with a scheme to allow for longer pipeline names.
