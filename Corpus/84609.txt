 URL : "https://github.com/davidepatti/noxim/issues/19" TITLE : depreciation of std::gets BODY : when compiling noxim using the included script, i encountered an error because gcc could not find std::gets which is used included from systemc.h . it seems that std::gets is no longer part of c++ since c++14 see http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/c/gets , so i presume that my gcc version 6.2.0-5ubuntu12 was defaulting to this newer standard. i was able to fix the build by forcing gcc to use c++11 which included std::gets . i did this by modifying noxim's makefile opts variable so as to use the option --std=c++11 in addition to what was already there. i have not checked whether versions of systemc newer than the one used by the installation script fix this issue.
