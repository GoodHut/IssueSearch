 URL : "https://github.com/devops-alpha-s17/customers/issues/105" TITLE : remove flushall method BODY : as a developer i need to remove the flushall method so that user doesn't accidentally calls it and erases all the data and also because the method is too unsafe for the integrity and safety of data. assumptions: the flushall method currently is called by sending a put request at /flushall acceptance criteria: given a running service when a put request is sent at /flushall then an error of no such method should be returned
