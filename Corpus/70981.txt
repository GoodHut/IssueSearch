 URL : "https://github.com/trystant/node-blog/issues/1" TITLE : 404 error on id mismatch BODY : providing a mismatched id when doing an update returns a 404 response and an error message that says, cannot put /blog-posts/:id . to reproduce: 1. start server 2. get the contents 3. set up the put request using one of the items' ids 4. restart the server 5. send the original put request without updating the id it would be helpful to see that the problem is an id mismatch - the code does handle that error but the user never sees the output using either using postman or with a straight curl call.
