 URL : "https://github.com/expressjs/timeout/issues/26" TITLE : extending the timeout BODY : so far as i understand it, the timeout value is set when you add the connect-timeout middleware when initializing the express server, so the same timeout applies to every request the comes in thereafter that matches the route concerned . what i'm finding is that for some incoming get requests, there is a particular combination of options in the request that causes a network fetch to a remote resource than is not very reliable. for those requests, i'd like to relax the timeout value for connect-timeout somewhat, to allow for a few fetch retries. but i can't see any way to change the timeout value 'on the fly', for a particular request. the only control i can see over the timeout is to use req.cleartimeout whilst processing a request. this is helpful, but timeout is completely removed and will not fire for this request in the future . this is not entirely what i'm looking to achieve... i would like to retain a timeout, but just a slightly longer one. is what i'm asking for really naughty, breaking established rules of good practice of which i'm not aware? or is it a reasonable thing to want to do?
