 URL : "https://github.com/kdhrubo/crx/issues/14" TITLE : data import from xls BODY : use servlet 3 feature instead of commons file upload. the uploaded file is stored in db until it is deleted. the file size is limited to 5mb. there will be no preview of the data loaded. the system must keep a marker as to how the data was loaded, may be a link to the load id. ensure that the uploader is only trying to upload xls, xlsx files. the upload process is submitted as a job which runs asynchronously. the user can view the status of all upload jobs in a different page.
