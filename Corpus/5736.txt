 URL : "https://github.com/mattdf/ens-check/issues/1" TITLE : small nit pick BODY : first, this thing is excellent. very useful. i entered some names with leading spaces just because that's how the data was stored in the text file i copied from. your app reported the 'wrong' dates although they were right, they included the leading spaces, so when i removed the leading spaces i got the right dates. suggestion: do a 'strip' of whitespace on each line unless the ens doesn't .
