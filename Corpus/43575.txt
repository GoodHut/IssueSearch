 URL : "https://github.com/smyte/jsxstyle/issues/71" TITLE : css animation support BODY : css animations are one of the last items on my list of reasons to use an external stylesheet. we could add object property support to the animation shorthand property: jsx // numeric keys are assumed to be percentages <block animation={{ 0: { opacity: 0 }, 100: { opacity: 1 }, }} /> // string keys and identifiers passed through as strings <block animation={{ from: { opacity: 0 }, to: { opacity: 1 }, }} animationduration= 600ms /> // string keys passed through as is <block animation={{ '0%, 100%': { opacity: 0 }, 50: { opacity: 1 }, }} /> behind the scenes the animation object would get crunched into @keyframes with a content-hashed name, and the animation prop on the final style object would get replaced with that hashed name as the animationname property. the only edge case i can think of right now is that the user specifies an animationname as well as an object animation , but that should be pretty easy to handle. this feature shouldn’t affect perf at all since it’s just an object check for a known property. still thinking this over, and it’s not super high priority or launch-blocking for jsxstyle 2.0.
