 URL : "https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/issues/6535" TITLE : vgg structure is wrong? BODY : i think the provided vgg structure as in mxnet/example/image-classification/symbols/vgg.py is wrong? it is not corresponding the provided pre-trained vgg16 model as in http://data.dmlc.ml/mxnet/models/imagenet/vgg/. for example, in the first conv group, there are two conv layers, but in vgg.py, there is only one. so, in this case, if we load the pre-trained vgg16, we are just loading part of the whole structures.
