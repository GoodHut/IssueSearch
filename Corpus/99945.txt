 URL : "https://github.com/dweidenfeld/plexdrive/issues/172" TITLE : not files showing in 4.0.0 BODY : i installed 4.0.0 and not all the files appear to be showing. when i mount with google ocaml they're available but when mounting with plexdrive they're not. the only thing i'm noticing is there are duplicate directories on the ones that seem to have missing files. has anyone else seen this?
