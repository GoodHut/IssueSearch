 URL : "https://github.com/aviabird/yatrum-api/issues/24" TITLE : add mit license? BODY : hey there! we were planning to use yatrum as a demo application for some training exercises. we noticed that the angular application is mit-licensed, but the rails api does not have a license file. any objections to adding an mit license to this repository? we're happy to continue linking back to aviabird and contribute some patches to this repository if they are applicable. thanks for all your hard work on this and angular-spree!
