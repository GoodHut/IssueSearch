 URL : "https://github.com/realm/jazzy/issues/722" TITLE : ignore specific functions BODY : is it possible to put some type of comment into the method doc that tells jazzy to ignore it? for example, in a custom uitableviewcontroller i've overridden viewdidload. i need the view controller to be documented, but i don't want viewdidload appearing in my generated docs for obvious reasons.
