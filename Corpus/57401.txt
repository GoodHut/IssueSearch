 URL : "https://github.com/info370/project-team-cups/issues/4" TITLE : proposal feedback: es3 BODY : this is a really interesting topic but you may want to consider narrowing/more clearly defining the scope. specifically, where are the borders of the seattle area that you're looking at? covering all of seattle seems like a lot of work - could you still gain valuable insight if you narrowed the scope to a smaller selection of neighborhoods? also, think about the date range for the data you want to use; scope in terms of time is another way you could narrow it down.
