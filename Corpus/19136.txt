 URL : "https://github.com/steptosky/3DsMax-XplnObj/issues/2" TITLE : wrong line export BODY : i have a 3-segment line with 3ds max coords: 0.88521 3.23816 1.952 0.00000 2.38316 4.100 -0.88521 3.23816 1.952 but inside obj file after export i get this weired coordinates: vline -1.95200 6.69064 -1.07349 0.50000 0.50000 0.50000 vline -4.10000 5.83563 -1.95870 0.50000 0.50000 0.50000 vline -1.95200 6.69064 -2.84391 0.50000 0.50000 0.50000 and also there is a problem with idx section in case if model have both polys and lines. in this case vertex index order for lines may not be the same as for polys. for example in my model idx sections starts as: idx10 2 1 0 3 0 1 6 5 4 7 and if i have for example 2 lines with 3 segments in each i will have a problem. instead of ids order for lines 0 1 2 3 4 5 i get 2 1 0 3 0 1 and lines will not draw correctly. solution is simple: change point_counts section and increase indices count as poly cnt + line cnt and add separate idx for lines in the end of idx section. would be nice if you could fix this two annoying bugs.
