BODY : right now, the wip css formatter seems to be using less? i'd like support for scss postcss-scss https://github.com/postcss/postcss-scss . i guess people writing vanilla css would like syntax errors for anything preprocessor syntax that isn't valid css as well. has there been any thoughts on this?
