 URL : "https://github.com/ganeti/ganeti/issues/809" TITLE : qa patching improvements BODY : originally reported of google code with id 753. the tests that a qa executes can be modified by provided a qa-patch.json file, and this functionality makes it easier to hunt down bugs without suffering the burden of running all the tests. the current implementation dictates that just one patch can be applied, and lifting that restriction could be useful. one could have a patch that runs a specific test on a local cluster, and another patch that adds cluster creation for using the buildbot. due to the power of the patching mechanism, patches could also be used to lessen the number of places where one has to specify the machine configurations, with these being patched in by buildbot on-the-fly. apart from the original qa-patch.json, any patches present in the qa/patch directory should also be applied, in alphabetical order and prior to the application of the qa-patch.json, which is assumed to be the user's first choice. another unrelated improvement: add pre-commit hooks to the repository to prevent the patches from being committed. originally added on 2014-03-07 12:12:08 +0000 utc.
