 URL : "https://github.com/absinthe-graphql/absinthe_relay/issues/56" TITLE : parsing nested ids BODY : absinthe currently has the parseids middleware, which converts ids for the top level object. it would be nice to have an easy way to parse the ids of nested objects as well. for example if you had { foo { id baz { id } bars { id } } } it would parse the id of foo , baz and all the bars assuming it's a has_many .
