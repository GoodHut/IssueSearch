 URL : "https://github.com/scorphus/plugin-go-gvm/issues/1" TITLE : $path entry is not valid BODY : i have the following error when using gvm use --default : set: warning: $path entry /home/simonszu/.gvm/pkgsets/go1.4/global/bin is not valid no such file or directory however, the bin-directory is found at ~/.gvm/pkgsets/go1.4/global/overlay . i am not sure if it's this plugin's fault or gvm's fault, so i am posting it here for now.
