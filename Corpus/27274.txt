 URL : "https://github.com/DerpyFirework/KSP-Structures/issues/16" TITLE : create forum thread BODY : plugin can handle placement of static objects, with the ability to act as a commnet node. each structure can have lodrange nodes with model nodes in each lodrange. each model can have multiple flagtransform values to apply the space programs flag, or a flag defined as a flagoverride. this is all achieved with minimal active code, so i think it's time to create a forum thread under add-on development, as the plugin has not been tested enough to be called a release.
