 URL : "https://github.com/bertilmuth/requirementsascode/issues/2" TITLE : including use cases BODY : right now, requirementsascode does not allow to include other use cases from a use case. including use cases makes it possible to reuse steps from other use cases. it avoids error prone duplication of steps between a use case. r1. the solution shall allow to include whole use cases, with all of their flows. for this, a new .aincludeusecase statement shall be created. r2. including shall be possible from any place in a flow where a step definition is possible. r3a. the including flow shall continue with the first step of the basic flow of the included flow, with the exception that an alternative flow of the included use case may interrupt. r3b. when the last step of the included basic flow has been run, the runner shall continue with the next step of the including flow after the .includeusecase statement .
