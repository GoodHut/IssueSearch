BODY : i saw your reddit comment https://www.reddit.com/r/xkcd/comments/612ix9/anyone_know_what_happened_to_the_site_search_and/dfchm9t/ about making the transcript available as an api since you already have all the data. are you still considering this? i also kinda have all the data here https://github.com/nhatzhk/randi/blob/1374c0d8e5e142051f48b466ebdd330848256ac1/json/xkcd.references.json . i compiled it by parsing the html from explainxkcd, but 'm pretty sure it got corrupted in the process for the transcript . if you're still willing to make it available i could help. i posted the idea n the explainxkcd website a while ago, but i've got no answers or any signs of interest so far http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/explain_xkcd:community_portal/proposals json_endpoint .
