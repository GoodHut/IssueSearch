 URL : "https://github.com/rachmanzz/vue-inview/issues/2" TITLE : how to set offset BODY : hey just a simple - maybe uninformed/stupid question - could you please describe how to correctly set a offset value. i tried it like this: import inview from 'vue-inview'; vue.use inview ; inview.threshold '100px' inview.offset '1000px' ; could you tell me what i did wrong. kinda confused by your documented way with // v_inview.offset / offset / // v_inview.threshold / threshold / keep up the good work ðŸ’¯ !
