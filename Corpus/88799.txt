 URL : "https://github.com/blakawk/gitlab-integration/issues/14" TITLE : origin url case sensitive BODY : i am using atom on ubuntu, my git origin url is as follows: git@gitlab.com:myusername/myrepo.git however the gitlab project is: https://gitlab.com/myusername/myrepo gitlab isn't case sensitive, so git operations succeed even though i am using myrepo.git instead of myrepo.git . however this plugin doesn't detect the gitlab project unless the origin url matches exactly: git@gitlab.com:myusername/myrepo.git when i update the origin url the plugin works immediately. it's only a minor inconvenience. i'd submit a pull request but i'm not familiar enough with coffeescript.
