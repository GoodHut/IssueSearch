 URL : "https://github.com/arguman/arguman.org/issues/347" TITLE : settingify default view BODY : now the default view is the tree view. we found the list view more intuitive for the new users. i propose to add setting that would allow for setting list as default view. 1. add setting default_premise_view with tree|list options. default to tree not to change existing deployment. 2. take it into account in view chooser at web/premises/views.py:54 web/premises/views.py l54
