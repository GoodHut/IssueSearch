 URL : "https://github.com/hoene/libmysofa/issues/38" TITLE : add a pkg-config file BODY : libmysofa should install a pkg-config file alongside the library and headers. this is especially useful and in a way necessary for static builds, where zlib and libm need to be explicitly linked to if support is compiled in. something simple like: > prefix=xxx > exec_prefix=${prefix} > libdir=${exec_prefix}/lib > includedir=${prefix}/include > > name: libmysofa > version: 0.7 > description: reader for aes sofa files to get better hrtfs > url: https://github.com/hoene/libmysofa > libs: -l${libdir} -lmysofa > libs.private: -lm -lz > cflags: -i${includedir} with -lm and -lz being included only if needed as detected by cmake should be enough.
