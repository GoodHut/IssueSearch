 URL : "https://github.com/LayoutFarm/Typography/issues/30" TITLE : upgrade to vs2017 BODY : i think the project should be upgraded to vs2017 since it has been released https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/releasenotes/vs2017-relnotes . the most important thing is that the support for .net standard including .net core is greatly improved in vs2017. also some project structures are changed. for example, project.json and .xproj are no longer used. instead, .csproj is used for all c projects in vs2017. vs2017 can easily upgrade vs2015 solution and projects automatically. and i have done that on my machine. i have been using vs2017 rc and rtm for several months. it provides more flexible installation and is smaller and quicker than the big vs2015. btw, the android projects using typography is written with vs2017--i can't install vs2015 on my machine because the remaining disk space is not enough.
