 URL : "https://github.com/pub12/outlookgreeting/issues/1" TITLE : some small bugs BODY : - reply all with multiple to addresses crashes the macro and you need to restart outlook - might want to note in the instructions that if you use a space instead of a comma as the delimitor, that the following code needs to change strsplit = split sendername, , ---> strsplit = split sendername, - anyway to drop the last letter of the first name if it is capitalized? ex: johnx smith. a few companies that i have worked at add a letter to differentiate between people of the same name, or to signify consultants, but it is strange to reply to johnx - make it look like a macro ;
