 URL : "https://github.com/hunterlester/safe-app-base/issues/2" TITLE : mock routing support BODY : i am using this with the latest safe browser, v0.8.0 with mock support. the app never receives an 'auth-response' from the safe browser after you authenticate in the browser. is this an issue with this app or does it just not support mock routing? any help you can give would be greatly appreciated.
