 URL : "https://github.com/petconnection/backend/issues/15" TITLE : upgrade to django 2.0 BODY : django 2.0 is released so we need to think about upgrading the version. i have read a little about the changes and the only thing i think it can affect us right now is the change in the urls path. in addition, django 2 supports python 3.4, 3.5 and 2.6. i think this is a really good point. we should think if we want to upgrade the version and when we want to do that. https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/releases/2.0/
