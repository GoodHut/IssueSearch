BODY : hey hi hey, what are the long term plans for this project? with the release of the java tensorflow api, we've started working on a project with similar goals over here https://github.com/enragedginger/tensorflow-clj . if we're looking to essentially build the same library, i'd be interested in merging projects so as to unify the community and build a more stable library.
