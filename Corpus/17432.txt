 URL : "https://github.com/haugene/docker-transmission-openvpn/issues/310" TITLE : permissions - osx BODY : i have this image running in a sandbox env. docker 17.06.2-ce-mac27 sonarr running locally on the mac not in a container sonarr can get the torrent to transmission transmission can download the file however sonarr can't interact with the downloaded file. if i run transmission locally not in a container this works fine. sonarr can rename and move the file. i believe this is a permissions issue. i just can figure out where. i ran the id command on the mac to get the uid and gid of the user that executes sonarr. i am running this container using the same values in the puid and pgid values but it still isn't working. any idea?
