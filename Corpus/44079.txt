 URL : "https://github.com/gcrahay/otx_misp/issues/21" TITLE : duplicate otx imports BODY : is there a way to import otx pulses without duplicating the pulses that have already been imported. everytime i run otx-misp the pulses are imported but the problem is that pulses that already exist on misp are also imported again one pulse now appears as multiple events on misp for example: 1. internet banking spyware this is a pulse that was imported by otx-misp into misp -> 30 minutes later a new pulse is added to the otx 2. hacking of a motor vehicel ->i then execute the otx-misp command again. both pulse 1 and 2 are important to the database ----------------------------------------------------------- so how can one avoid to import pulse 1 when import command is executed again?
