 URL : "https://github.com/bobintetley/asm3/issues/294" TITLE : online form: skip logic BODY : people ask for this a lot - could elements of an online form be hidden based on the values of another element? i guess we could have a visible if expression for fields. if something is present in one when the form is constructed, a javascript block is inserted that runs after every field blur event delegate to all and hides the element if the values don't match.
