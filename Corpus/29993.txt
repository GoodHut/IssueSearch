 URL : "https://github.com/w3c/wake-lock/issues/98" TITLE : new type: location? BODY : this is sort of subsetting 86. when i want to keep collecting location information, i don't necessarily want the rest of the system to run - in particular, although wifi, gps and phone connection may be used to provide location information, it's not clear that i want other external things to keep running, and when i want my system not to sleep - e.g. because it is playing music - i don't necessarily want to leave on the rest of the system, especially battery-intensive stuff like various interfaces for shifting data over the air, or privacy-impacting stuff like tracking my location. does it makes sense to use wake lock for background location tracking - and how do we implement this? obviously it's one of those painfully privacy-sensitive interfaces that potentially affect personal security in a big way, but also offers lots of useful functionality. see also https://github.com/w3c/serviceworker/issues/745
