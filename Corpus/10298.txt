 URL : "https://github.com/libtrading/libtrading/issues/140" TITLE : build on windows BODY : is there anything specific that could prevent a build on windows under mingw? i haven't tried this but am interested and if it builds then want to do a p/invoke wrapper for .net core. i looked into the code briefly and see gcc specific attributes, but i am far from being an expert in x-plat c compilation and used to have some pain when had to deal with this.
