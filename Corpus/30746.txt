 URL : "https://github.com/combust/mleap/issues/299" TITLE : question re runtime BODY : hi, this is a question - not an issue: in your airbnb example on https://github.com/combust/mleap/tree/master/mleap-serving, the whole leap frame is sent in the request for a prediction. this includes the schema as well as the data. eg. { schema : { fields : { name : state , type : { type : basic , base : string , isnullable : true } }, { name : bathrooms , type : { type : basic , base : double , isnullable : true } }, { ... }, rows : ny , 2.0, 1250.0, 3.0, 50.0, 30.0, 2.0, 56.0, 90.0, entire home/apt , 1.0 , strict , 1.0 } is it currently possible or is this on your roadmap to send only the data - especially as the schema is already known by the server? i am aware that the schema can be obtained eg. by a curl -xget ... http://localhost:65327/model , but it would be an improvement for the requestor not to have to get the schema, only to have to submit it with the data . colin goldberg
