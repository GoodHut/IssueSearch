 URL : "https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/3176" TITLE : office 365 in windows hvm BODY : qubes os version: <!-- e.g., r3.2 you can get it from the dom0 terminal with the command cat /etc/qubes-release type below this line. --> r.3.2 affected templatevms: <!-- e.g., fedora-23 , if applicable type below this line. --> hvm win 7 --- because of the lack of windows to recognize the connectivity and that the system is connected to internet, it seems that the connection module of office once installed, can't recognized that windows is connected and so it cannot connect me to my account to retrieve my notes on onenote for example. i never encountered this issue just after the installation and since the network in win7 hvm is known issue, i guess it's been related. is there any attempt to resolve the pronlem of the network not being identified ?
