 URL : "https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/22519" TITLE : boogie is broken on darwin BODY : issue description the status of hydra job ‘nixpkgs:trunk:dotnetpackages.boogie.x86_64-darwin’ is failed . for details, see https://hydra.nixos.org/build/47914149. the following dependent job also failed: nixpkgs:trunk:dafny.x86_64-darwin https://hydra.nixos.org/build/47912762 apparently the builder mono? cannot find libgdiplus when it needs it. i have no way to debug this on darwin, so any help would be useful. the straightforward solution is to disable boogie on darwin. /cc @taktoa, any idea ?
