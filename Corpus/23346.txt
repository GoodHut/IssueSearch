 URL : "https://github.com/artemsheludko/adam-blog/issues/5" TITLE : page scroll issues BODY : hi artem, a chrome extension 1 i'm using seems to be conflicting with the scrolling behaviour on the adam-blog. i thought it could have been the overflow: hidden property, but that doesn't seem to be it. if i disable the extension i'm able to scroll on pages just fine. would you by chance know what code might be affecting the site's page scroll behaviour? thanks for sharing your work. 1 : https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromium-wheel-smooth-scr/khpcanbeojalbkpgpmjpdkjnkfcgfkhb
