 URL : "https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/issues/286" TITLE : <ref> inside <listref> BODY : over the course of addressing issues 1667 https://github.com/teic/tei/issues/1667 and 1674 https://github.com/teic/tei/issues/1674 in tei , @sydb and i noticed that the component parts of 1449 https://github.com/teic/tei/issues/1449 allowing <ref> inside <listref> were not fully addressed. elli mentioned in a comment that the odd stylesheets would need to be changed https://github.com/teic/tei/issues/1449 issuecomment-214789475 , but it appear that that hasn't happened. basically, <ref> was added to the content model of <listref> , but the odd stylesheets do not process listref/ref in any way they only address <ptr> . we either need to update this or introduce a schematron warning when <ref> occurs inside <listref> in an odd.
