 URL : "https://github.com/MacPython/astropy-wheels/issues/10" TITLE : new lts branch BODY : we soon have the release of 3.0 of astropy out that limits the supported versions significantly. on the other hand we keep supporting the lts, 2.0.x branch. i wonder what's the best solution to keep the infrastructure for both? shall we just simply branch out an lts branch that keeps all the python2 and 3.4 support, etc?
