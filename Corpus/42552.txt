 URL : "https://github.com/summernote/summernote/issues/2213" TITLE : bootstrap vs. own css BODY : i know this issue has been up earlier, but with no useable result... i want to use summernote in my own design, but using the entire bootstrap css messes things up. i presume that summernote uses just a little part of this massive stylesheet and it is a waste of bandwidth to load 120kb if only 20 is needed. doesn't anyone have a list of exactly the selectors used from bootstrap css so i could delete the rest?
