 URL : "https://github.com/mysticatea/eslint-plugin-vue-trial/issues/3" TITLE : current status of plugin BODY : love the work here! we're looking at incorporating at least some of these rules into the official eslint-plugin-vue , so was wondering: are all these rules or a subset of them currently considered stable? if so, do you recommend simply requiring this plugin to import the rules we want - or is this repo more of a playground for experimentation? again, thanks for the fantastic work!
