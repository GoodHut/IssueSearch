 URL : "https://github.com/jacobslusser/ScintillaNET/issues/320" TITLE : scroll to line number BODY : i need to scroll the editor to a specific line and have that line be in the middle of the control. i've read thru the various issues and tried a number of things but i still don't have something that works right. this is what i have right now: line line = this.texteditor.lines linenumber - 1 ; this.texteditor.scrollrange line.position, line.position ; this scrolls the line into view as expected -- great. what i want is to have the line in the middle of the control. so i tried this, which seems reasonable. int linesvisible = this.texteditor.linesonscreen; linenumber = linenumber - linesvisible / 2 ; line line = this.texteditor.lines linenumber - 1 ; this.texteditor.scrollrange line.position, line.position ; problem is that linesonscreen does not return the number of visible lines. the returned value is must less that what i expect. what am i doing wrong???
