 URL : "https://github.com/GoogleChrome/omnitone/issues/39" TITLE : 0.2.0 is broken on npm BODY : the main property in this projects package.json https://github.com/googlechrome/omnitone/blob/master/package.json l5 file points to src/main.js . it should point to build/omnitone.js or build/omnitone.min.js so the module can be required correctly. do you have a preference to which file in the build/ directory that should be the main entry to the module? cc @hoch
