 URL : "https://github.com/keepkey/multibit-hd/issues/984" TITLE : i have a big problem. BODY : so, my problem is that, whenever i get paid via bitcoin i use multibit as a wallet. everything works fine, people can send me money. but for some reason i can't use it, it says, whenever i try to buy something, low spendable balance detected. some of your bitcoins are tied up with ongoing transactions. even though i have around 10x the amount needed. so i read some similar issues, and the answer was to repair your wallet, so i did.but now 80% of my confirmed balance is now unconfirmed, and the issue still persists. please help. yours faithfully, tijn
