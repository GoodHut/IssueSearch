 URL : "https://github.com/EDDiscovery/EDDiscovery/issues/1240" TITLE : decimal sign issue in pos BODY : on systems with locales that use , as the decimal mark, the pos field of the system information gets broken up as it's the same character as the separator. for example, what would be 12.23, 34.47, 100.42 becomes 12,23, 34,47, 100,42 . it's a minor issue, but it would be good if the decimal mark was converted to . , which is used by the game anyway.
