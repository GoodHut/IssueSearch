 URL : "https://github.com/vcc-LG/brachy-dose-reporter/issues/12" TITLE : add eqd2 functionality BODY : whilst we're recording doses as they come out of omp, the vienna spreadsheet https://www.americanbrachytherapy.org/guidelines/gyn_hdr_bt_docu_sheets.xls which converts those doses into eqd2 https://www.astro.org/...and.../radiobiology%20gyn%20marples.pdf values which are what's used to determine if the overall dose has met the total brachy + external constraints... so, this needs to be added, probably as an extra column next to the parameter in the patient_details table.
