 URL : "https://github.com/sonarwhal/sonarwhal.com/issues/307" TITLE : design & build status page BODY : need a status page similar to https://www.traviscistatus.com/ to show how the scanner has been doing in the last few days. it will be updated every few minutes maybe 15? . i think it should be publicly available. some of the metrics: - graphs with the number of scans over time - graphs with the number of successful and failed scans over time maybe it can be merged with the previous one - graphs with the status of the queues over time and the number of workers working - average time to get a job started since the moment it gets to the queue to the moment it starts scanning . maybe current average and also graph with value over time. - average time to get a job finished since the moment it starts to the moment we get all the results . maybe current average and also graph with value over time. @molant do we have a full list of metrics, or are we just going with the above from your previous email?
