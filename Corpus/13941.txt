 URL : "https://github.com/gunterhager/UDPBroadcastConnection/issues/2" TITLE : a timeout feature BODY : nice udp implementation, simple and enough and i'm using it in a new app. a feature that could be convenient would be a timeout after sending broadcasting. in my app i send data, but if my target device is off, no response, then the app just does nothing. of course i will implement a timeout feature on the app and considering it on the main lib, maybe ;
