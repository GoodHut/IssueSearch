 URL : "https://github.com/GreenSense/GreenSense/issues/2" TITLE : add link to forum BODY : the website should have the forum as a featured link, easily accessible and visible. i suggest switching discussions to a tag based discussion board, or if not available a traditional category based forum. a free hosted one is the simplest to set up and maintain unless someone wants to host one. a link to the google group could be added for now.
