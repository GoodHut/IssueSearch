 URL : "https://github.com/jstevensog/wixel-sdk/issues/28" TITLE : 2.47e does not work BODY : i flashed 2.47e on my wixel, but this version does not work properly. the hm-10 connects to my phone, the yellow led on my the wixel is on, and the red one is blinking four ! times then it pauses and again blinking four times and so on. with 2.47d it works actually fine, but often it doesn't recover from signal drops and it needs to be reset.
