 URL : "https://github.com/icflorescu/openshift-cartridge-nodejs/issues/86" TITLE : looking for maintainers BODY : hi everyone, thank you for using this cartridge since the beginning of 2015. i'm not using openshift in my projects anymore, which means there's now little reason for me to maintain this repository as well as it probably deserves. so, if anyone is willing and ready to step up and become a maintainer, please don't hesitate to drop me a line!
