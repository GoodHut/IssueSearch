 URL : "https://github.com/UltimateHackingKeyboard/agent/issues/535" TITLE : reverse scrolling on osx BODY : osx users have reported that the upwards and downwards scroll directions are reversed with the uhk and in agent. in other words, upwards actually goes downwards, and vice-versa. the reason is that in osx 10.7 apple introduced a feature called natural scrolling. this reversed the scrolling direction on scroll wheels and trackpads to make it match better with ios. so in reality, agent shows the correct direction, and works as expected on linux, windows, and also on osx when natural scrolling is disabled, but not when natural scrolling is enabled on osx. this issue is fundamentally problematic. imagine connecting the uhk to a mac with natural scrolling disabled. it'll work as expected. then connect it into another mac with natural scrolling enabled. it'll work in reverse. it's impossible to detect over usb whether natural scrolling is enabled, so the correct direction cannot be guaranteed by any input device. i plan to solve this issue by: 1. explaining natural scrolling to osx users on https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/start/mouse 2. reversing the scroll upwards and scroll downwards mouse actions on the preloaded mac keymaps.
