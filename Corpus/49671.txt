 URL : "https://github.com/3scale/apicast/issues/207" TITLE : unify parameter names BODY : some parameters start with threescale_ and some with apicast_ and some with no prefix at all. some don't match their name in the openshift template. expected result all parameters in the openshift template should follow the same format. they don't have to necessarily be the same as the apicast environment variable, because the prefix might be redundant. reported in https://github.com/3scale/apicast/pull/176
