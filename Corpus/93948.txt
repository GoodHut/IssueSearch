 URL : "https://github.com/upspin/upspin/issues/253" TITLE : availing snapshots offline BODY : originally wrote this in via email to the mailing list: > it seems like it would be convenient to synchronize a snapshot of my home directory stored in upspin onto my laptop before travelling e.g. to foreign countries where i don’t necessarily have good internet access. > > iiuc, a cache server does not guarantee that blocks are available, even if i were to read through the entire snapshot once. > > does that mean that i need to run a local dirserver and storeserver which can serve the same blocks/entries? > > is this feature in scope for upspin itself, or do you count on external projects to take care of these aspects of data distribution? as per @robpike’s reply, filing this issue so that the feature request will be kept in scope.
