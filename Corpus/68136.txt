 URL : "https://github.com/Inboxen/Inboxen/issues/241" TITLE : remove js from nav menu BODY : on smaller screen sizes, the menu at the top shrinks down and the items are replaced by a hamburger . click the hamburger, and the menu pops down. as this is the bootstrap default, the button currently works via js. we currently render the menu open and then the first thing our js does is close the menu. this is so those who have disabled js can still use our site. however, as we don't wait for js before rendering the page mobile users experience a pop once the js loads up. there is a css-only solution to this: use an off-canvas checkbox and a label with attribute for=id_for_checkbox wrapped around the hamburger button. the rest is fairly normal css, most of which is probably already present. it should be noted that it is still a bit of a hack, but it means less js and a less rubbish experience on mobile.
