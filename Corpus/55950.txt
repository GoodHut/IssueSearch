 URL : "https://github.com/aso2101/satavahana-inscriptions/issues/51" TITLE : make a page for places BODY : we have a working place.html but the odd doesn't do anything with <place> s at the moment. write some behaviours to put in the odd. @wsalesky i've assigned myself but feel free to take a stab at this--- beḍsā.xml is a good example. actually, app:related-inscriptions is called but doesn't seem to do anything here. we should have a list of all the inscriptions at each site which we already have in browse.html .
