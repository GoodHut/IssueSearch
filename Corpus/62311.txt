 URL : "https://github.com/trentmwillis/ember-exam/issues/101" TITLE : chrome headless support BODY : it seems that when trying to use chrome headless i get a bunch of port already in use errors. i suspect this is because chrome headless requires you to use the command line arg --remote-debugging-port=9292 . when ember exam spawns multiple browsers it must just reuse the testem config and thus the subsequent browsers cannot actually bind to the port they need.
