 URL : "https://github.com/pwsafe/pwsafe/issues/300" TITLE : upcoming v4 format BODY : as noted in this paper https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/files/6487/pwvault.pdf , not having to reencrypt the database on change of the master password i.e. letting k, l remain unchanged poses a potential security problem which cannot be easily dealt with by the user. v3 of the database works around this problem by choosing different k, l on any save after a modification, including change of the master password. but v4 proposes a way for multiple, independent master passwords. in this format, one would be unable to ever change k, l without knowledge of all mps, since one can only calculate keyblocks for known passwords. thus, the security of the database will differ substantially when adding/removing entries in multi password mode without asking all passwords at all time. what are your plans in order to deal with this perceived issue?
