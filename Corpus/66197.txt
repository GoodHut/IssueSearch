 URL : "https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards/issues/2141" TITLE : media block not working BODY : causes issues in the landing page template and banner and i can't use that helper class for my media object needs anymore. .usa-media_block-img { float: left; } being overridden by .usa-media_block-img { float: none; } the second section of code is useful if you want it to drop the text below the image, like on small widths, but it should not be the default, we still need the basic code to work.
