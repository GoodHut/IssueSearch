 URL : "https://github.com/conda-forge/ipython-feedstock/issues/27" TITLE : framework build on macos BODY : currently conda-forge python does not launch with the framework build of python, which means it can't be used for interacting with wxpython applications for example setting matplotlib backend to wx . if i understand this correctly, it might be possible to fix this with as little as adding: build: osx_is_app: true and probably adding the python.app dependency. test: in 1 : import matplotlib as mpl in 2 : mpl.use 'wx' in 3 : from matplotlib import pyplot as plt in 4 : plt.plot 0, 1 an exception has occurred, use %tb to see the full traceback. systemexit: this program needs access to the screen. please run with a framework build of python, and only when you are logged in on the main display of your mac.
