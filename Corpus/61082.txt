 URL : "https://github.com/brucefan1983/GPUMD/issues/1" TITLE : add vashishta potential BODY : hi, i'm working on smaller systems using the vashishta potential http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/pair_vashishta.html , but gpu implementations both gpu package and kokkos in lammps have an upper limit of timesteps/second due to kernel execution overhead. so a pure gpu code could outperform lammps thanks to this. since vashishta is so similar to stillinger weber, maybe it would be easy for you to add it? another trick for vashishta is that 3-body forces usually have a shorter cutoff than 2-body, so the 3-body loop should make use of this cache only neighbors within 3-body cutoff . great work btw!
