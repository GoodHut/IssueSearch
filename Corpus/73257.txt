double free or corruption detected by glibc the failure is not deterministic... sometimes, coqide.byte doesn't segfault after the first command i am using print nat. ; sometimes, it just segfaults and sometimes it aborts with a double free or corruption detected by glibc sample output attached . > attached file: coqide-byte-failure.log https://coq.inria.fr/bugfiles/attachment.cgi?id=206 text/plain, 6168 bytes > description: double free or corruption detected by glibc @ gares on 2015-02-15 16:20:26 +0100 i think that after coqide was made thread free this issue does no apply anymore.
i've also used the byte version of coqide yesterday with no problems at all under linux and windows. closing the bug.
