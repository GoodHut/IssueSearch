BODY : hey likely a dumb problem i have here but all i'm looking to do is telnet to a switch and run one tftp command and quit. that's it. this is my code: const telnet = require 'telnet-client' async function westellrun { let connection = new telnet let params = { host: '10.0.0.91', port: 23, //shellprompt: ' ', timeout: 4500, username: 'admin', password: 'password', loginprompt: 'login:', passwordprompt: 'password:' } await connection.connect params let res = await connection.exec copy startup-config tftp://10.0.0.49/westells/alextest600 console.log 'async result:', res ; } westellrun .catch err => { console.log err } what happens here is that it appears to connect but i get a timeout error like this: > alexanders-macbook-pro:switch_backup_node awitte$ node westell3.js > error: response not received > at timeout.settimeout as _ontimeout /users/awitte/documents/github/switch_backup_node/node_modules/telnet-client/lib/index.js:150:47 > at ontimeout timers.js:488:11 > at tryontimeout timers.js:323:5 > at timer.listontimeout timers.js:283:5 i have to ctrl c to quit it. if i run a different command instead of the the tftp one like a show version i get the correct output although i still need to ctrl c to end the process. that tftp command works fine if i manually telnet in and executes in about a second. any thoughts?
