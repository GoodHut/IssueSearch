 URL : "https://github.com/jlund/streisand-discussions/issues/30" TITLE : planned migration tools BODY : i think there’s also a need for user-visible machine inventories, but different issue. often, you know in advance that you’ll be migrating streisand services from one host to another. some people trust the integrity of streisand-hosted https more than they trust the method they will use to get their streisand.html files. it would be nice to have a way to put a banner on the web server: “this server is moving. click here for the new certificate and connection instructions.” for new servers, what you’d really like to do is notify vpn users of the upcoming change when they connect to old-streisand. i don’t know if this is possible for any or all services.
