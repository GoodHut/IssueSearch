 URL : "https://github.com/openSUSE/obs-service-tar_scm/issues/158" TITLE : project needs a rename BODY : as seen in 157 this repo has extended its scope quite a lot and now provides 5 different services, only two of which are related to tar . so i propose we rename the project. to be clear, i am not proposing renaming the services which already have good names - just the project. i guess this should only require renaming the github repo and then repointing files like https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/opensuse:tools/obs-service-tar_scm/_service?expand=1 to it, so it should be a small change. any thoughts on this and suggestions for new names? /cc @adrianschroeter @m0ses
