 URL : "https://github.com/humanitiesprogramming/humanitiesprogramming.github.io/issues/22" TITLE : update slides for python BODY : - concepts 1 - concepts 2 - concepts 3 can start from there. i wouldn't overwrite them. rather, copy the files and start replacing stuff. i can do the theoretical bits about python or help with any parts that are too complicated for you. will also need to update the slides repo. - https://github.com/humanitiesprogramming/slides/issues/1
