 URL : "https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-RTPS/issues/151" TITLE : documentation out of date? BODY : i am attempting to use the reader/writer layer and i am following the documentation here http://docs.eprosima.com/en/latest/rtps.html configuring-readers-and-writers . specifically when trying to send data the documentation gives this snippet: //request a change from the history cachechange_t ch = writer->newcachechange alive ; //write serialized data into the change ch->serializedpayload->length = sprintf ch->serializedpayload->data, my string %d , 2 ; //insert change back into the history. the writer takes care of the rest. history->add_change ch ; but searching the code base, the function newcachechange is not found. writers to have a new_change function, but it takes very different arguments and there does not appear to be any documentation on how this function should be used to send data.
