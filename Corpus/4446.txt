 URL : "https://github.com/Anyline/anyline-ocr-cordova-module/issues/10" TITLE : crash on ios 9 BODY : we are currently evaluating the anyline sdk with a cordova app on a trial license. got it to work on ios 10 and 11, but the only ios 9 device we have ipad 2 - the app crashes when starting the scan. no error message, just crashes, it doesn't get to the camera permission prompt, and it looks like that may be where the issue is. i don't have any more data to give you right now, just wondering if you have seen this issue or maybe if you could test it on your side too. thanks in advance
