 URL : "https://github.com/castleproject/Home/issues/6" TITLE : documentation and web site BODY : was wondering what you want to do with the following: http://www.castleproject.org/ do we want to give it a face lift or move it to a gh wiki? https://github.com/castleproject/core/tree/master/docs https://github.com/castleproject/windsor/tree/master/docs this has alot of stuff here, do we intended to maintain it there or do we also want to transition this over to a wiki somewhere? should we make it all consistent? are there markdown styling guidelines? would be good to clean this up and make it all look consistent.
