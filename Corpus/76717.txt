 URL : "https://github.com/budgie-desktop/budgie-desktop/issues/835" TITLE : low battery notification BODY : every time the battery runs low on my laptop, instead of getting the notification with a single sound it makes the clicking sound several times in fast succession and the message keeps reappearing. when i then plug in the cable the message pops up another 4 times and then everything is ok. nothing major but probably easy to fix. many thanks!
