 URL : "https://github.com/BluSunrize/ImmersiveEngineering/issues/2069" TITLE : item router sorting issue BODY : what is the bug? i setup an item router but it doesn't seem to be respecting my filters. specifically, i setup sand to go the green route and for some reason it just keeps spitting it up white route . i even tried to block the white route by specifying an arbitrary item but it still outputs items to the white route. http://imgur.com/a/hbu0q what did you do to make it happen? specify an item to go to the green route, block all outer routes, it will output the item to the white route. does it happen every time you do this? does it happen if you do something else as well? e.g. the game crashes with a similar crash whenever an item that can not be processed in the crusher is thrown into one. . yes, this happens even with items other than sand. did this happen on a dedicated server multiplayer servers , in lan multiplayer or in singleplayer? e.g. i first noticed this on a server, but it happens in singleplayer as well . tested in singleplayer, but i assume it happens in multiplayer. what other mods were installed when the bug happened? immersiveengineering-0.10-57 https://pastebin.com/qepdqe4c
