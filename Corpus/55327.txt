 URL : "https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/2636" TITLE : input/output hiding ui BODY : first of all, thanks a lot for implementing this killer feature! looking forward also to it propagating to nbformat and nbconvert/nbviewer! a couple of things about the ui: perhaps make ←/→ in the command mode shortcuts for input hiding/expanding, or any other shortcut for what matters. appearance: if the cell is longer than the screen size, the collapse arrow isn't visible, and the user needs to know in advance that clicking anywhere on the cell selection collapses it. not sure what's the best way to deal with that. add another arrow on the top of the unit cell? i'm also wondering if the triple dots occupy too much space, especially if there are several consecutive cells hidden, like here i tried to imagine a real life usage scenario : ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2069677/27975092-1478c9ec-6361-11e7-8ac0-ed33c43f93da.png
