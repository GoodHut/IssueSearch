 URL : "https://github.com/jtwig/jtwig/issues/338" TITLE : add string support to date BODY : as 255 adds string support to modify_date , it seems to miss date which initially was asked for . using e.g. spring webflow, which serializes and deserializes fields automatically, date becomes useless, because date getters return string s instead of java.util.date s. i'd love to see the same input format support as in modify_date . this is a kind of duplicate of 251, but that one is closed by the pull request mentioned above.
