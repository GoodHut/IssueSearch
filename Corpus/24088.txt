 URL : "https://github.com/Esri/bayview/issues/29" TITLE : search can be slow BODY : the search can be very slow and i think its a result of the way it automatically kicks off the search. if it starts searching and you update the search string it re-queries the services but a slow typer might then start the query process several times. the more times it restarts the queries the long it takes overall to finish it seems though i'm just using the timestamps in firefox's dev console to test that. bumping the searchdelay in the search config up to 2000ms from 400ms so it waits longer to query after you stop typing seems to mitigate it but i am not sure how to properly benchmark it.
