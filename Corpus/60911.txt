 URL : "https://github.com/opencadc/vostools/issues/76" TITLE : add progressbar for vcp BODY : i just started using the tools, and it would be very helpful to have a progressbar and eta for vcp . i think this could be done easily here https://github.com/opencadc/vostools/blob/72b5c8cd2e68afd607c6b5d782fc58f43d31396e/vos/vos/vos.py l142 . we have a simple setup in astroquery https://github.com/astropy/astroquery/blob/master/astroquery/query.py l270 that uses astropy's progressbar, but there are other good alternatives available.
