 URL : "https://github.com/RPISEC/MBE/issues/31" TITLE : gets and libc >= 2.23 BODY : when i try to compile i have 1 error about the usage of gets a cpp file and multiple warning on c file but it's ok for the prupose of this repo . after looking rount a bit i found out i have a glibc 2.25 and in the changelog 2.23 of the glibc there is: iso c11 support: + do not declare gets. i locally change it to fgets with a big size but maybe you want to fix it in another way.
