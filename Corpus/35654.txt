 URL : "https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-node/issues/131" TITLE : event never received BODY : i'm doing the simplest possible example, and i've waited several minutes-- segment.io is still showing no events ever received in the debugger. javascript const analytics = require 'analytics-node' const client = new analytics '<write key from segment>' client.track { event: 'event1', userid: 'user123' } i've configured segment.io with a server source, and i double-checked the write key is correct. this seems like a hello world for this package and segment.io, not sure why it isn't working.
