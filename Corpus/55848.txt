 URL : "https://github.com/gantry/gantry5/issues/1844" TITLE : localisation of gantry BODY : although not directly related to multilingual sites, translating the gantry interface into other languages would be very nice and would open it up to many opportunities. however, i understand that maintaining up-to-date translations of the interface can be daunting. but there are ways to solve that. much like joomla itself has outside groups that maintain localisation of the cms, using crowdsource solutions can address that. one of the best options may be transifex https://www.transifex.com . the best thing about transifex is that it is free for open source projects. and both gantry and gravesend can benefit from it. additionally, it's api allows integration into github. i'd love to get some +1s on this idea.
