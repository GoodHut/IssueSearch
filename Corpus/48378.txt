 URL : "https://github.com/opentx/opentx.github.io/issues/26" TITLE : rss with empty posts? BODY : i am regularly seeing empty posts that just have names as description in the rss feed. for example: 31. mai 2017, 16:55 roberto 31. mai 2017, 16:55 eugene lafaille 31. mai 2017, 16:55 andrew fernie 31. mai 2017, 16:55 michael napolitan they link to pages like this: http://www.open-tx.org/2017/05/31/2015-04-22-roberto-feedback i am not sure why these are generated, but it's always confusing to see oh news from opentx and then there's nothing.
