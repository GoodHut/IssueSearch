 URL : "https://github.com/jaagr/polybar/issues/376" TITLE : font size discrepancy BODY : it's not an issue per se, but after the last update a few hours ago as of this writing the font of my polybar got bigger somehow? i didn't touch the config for a while now, and i couldn't find anything of sort in the recent commits so i'm basically asking a question here. the font was definitely smaller, because the top bar used to fit on the screen, now some parts are going off screen going over the upper border
