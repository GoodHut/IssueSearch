BODY : i've been trying to get the list of files that have been renamed from a particular diff. i can see that i get at least get the shas for the src and dst of a particular difffile . ideally i'd want the process_full_diff method inside diff.rb : if m = /^diff --git a\/ . ? b\/ . ? /.match line current_file = m 1 final current_file = defaults.merge {:patch => line, :path => current_file} else to also include the second capture and expose these properties as src_file_path and dst_file_path . is there something i'm missing? is there an easier way to do this today?
