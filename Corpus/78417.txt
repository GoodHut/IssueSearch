 URL : "https://github.com/danyadsmith/singular-brand/issues/42" TITLE : process contact messages BODY : for the basic mvp, we set up a simple messages api that stores all contact messages in the database. in order to receive instant notification of contacts received via the site, we will implement twilio for sms. add twilio credentials to the .env file for development or as environment variables in deployed environments. modify the configuration files for development, testing and production to include these keys. create a twilio middleware that will send an sms message that contains the contents of the contact form after persisting the data to the database.
