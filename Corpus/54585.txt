 URL : "https://github.com/alexrj/Slic3r/issues/4103" TITLE : gpl violation? xyzware BODY : hi. after poking around xyzware, i found its slicer, and extracted it. they statically linked with perl, which is its own issue, but in it was some code that looked... rather like slic3r. you can see it at: https://www.diffchecker.com/cxcyu4tm which is the xyzware version vs https://github.com/alexrj/slic3r/blame/37105e8237272565b60550c41945b3c41b11a9d9/lib/slic3r/print/object.pm its a four year old version they are using, only lightly hacked.
