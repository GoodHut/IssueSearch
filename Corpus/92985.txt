 URL : "https://github.com/sebastius/SK6812RGBW-for-ESP32/issues/2" TITLE : add a test e.g. strandtest BODY : i am interested in using this library, since it has a very clean and simple interface. if it worked it would be my preferred way of driving my pixels. unfortunately, i could not get the library to drive my sk6812 pixels yet. i have adapted a version of the strandtest from https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=364208.0 using an array of rgbwvalue s, setting its values, and passing it to your library instead of calling strip.show . getting the adaptation to compile was quite easy, but nothing happened. in its original state, the strandtest worked. that is why i would ask for an example e.g. an adapted strandtest from you if you donÂ´t mind.
