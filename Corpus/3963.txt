 URL : "https://github.com/LemADEC/WarpDrive/issues/288" TITLE : a little help? BODY : so i built a pretty big version of the starship enterprise 9442 blocks in total . i programmed the computercraft computer just fine, but whenever i try to jump my ship, that is , a message pops up in chat saying that my ship stretches across too many chunks, and that the max is set to 25. i want to know if theres a way to extend the max chunks, and if so, how to do this. thanks!
