 URL : "https://github.com/WordPress/press-this/issues/4" TITLE : easy way back to wp-admin BODY : see 3 and https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32340 the site name takes you to the front-end of a website, not wp-admin. per @stephdau: > that site name was originally thought out to become a menu once clicked, giving site switching options to the user. this wasn't implemented yet? but the link stayed. i think going to wp-admin is a better link as well. > q: should we make it filterable, while we're at it?
