 URL : "https://github.com/USGS-WiM/ServicesDocumentation/issues/4" TITLE : passing in values via url BODY : a nice feature to have would be to be able to pass values in the url to go directly to a documentation page filling those values in. for instance, if someone asked me what are all the stn sites in wi? it would be cool to hand back a url that goes here: https://stntest.wim.usgs.gov/stnservices2/documentation/site/statesites and includes the parameters to change the response to .geojson and adds wi as the state abbr.
