 URL : "https://github.com/soflyy/wp-all-import-rapid-addon/issues/9" TITLE : clarify the license BODY : hi, by nature, the rapid addon, being a library, is meant to be included in 3rd party products. however no license is specified, neither in the php file, nor in the readme file. the license is important as it could condition the license of the derivative addon or possibly make an addon impossible to release in case the addon would have to rely on code with an incompatible license . after some search, i found a version used in one of your addon, released as gplv2 or later as it is https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/yoast-seo-settings-xml-csv-import/trunk/readme.txt , but it would be much better if the license was clearly stated in the library source.
