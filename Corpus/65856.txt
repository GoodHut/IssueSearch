 URL : "https://github.com/opsdroid/opsdroid-desktop/issues/17" TITLE : linux snap installation BODY : hi, i just watched https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wyii_cpode, the getting started with opsdroid on ubuntu 16.04 video you did. i couldn't help but think that the installation instructions for ubuntu are not very straight forward. i recently heard about the new ubuntu snap thing, https://docs.snapcraft.io/snaps/intro. i wondered if it would be a better way of distributing opsdroid desktop. i should qualify, i've only heard about this from a podcast, i don't know anything about how snaps work, or their limitation, or what's involved in making a snap. cheers, geoff
