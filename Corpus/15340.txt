 URL : "https://github.com/elmsln/elmsln/issues/2174" TITLE : delete old fields BODY : we're several years into our deployment... 4 at this point. there are parts of the data model from those days that still hang around in some very old site deploys. it would be good to ensure they aren't there via cleaning up the db / content types. this will require a lot of testing to ensure we have the right process but we need to do update hooks that target fields from older mental models and replace them.
