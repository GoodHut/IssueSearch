BODY : hello @powroupi! how are you doing? i congratulate and thank you for all of your excellent work on mmd tools. can you please add support for the import and export of .vpd vocaloid pose data files? mmd tools already has support for import and export of .vmd files, so this should not be too difficult a task should it?
