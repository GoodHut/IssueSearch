BODY : i ran lighthouse tests, and in all honesty, i was surprised our performance wasn't worse! but we are still getting a 45 out of 100, as we aren't caching anything or including a manifest, etc. so many easy wins to get this score up. gitlists_lighthouse.pdf https://github.com/gittrending/gittrending/files/1015870/gitlists_lighthouse.pdf
