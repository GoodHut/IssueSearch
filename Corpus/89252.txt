 URL : "https://github.com/haiwen/seafile/issues/1860" TITLE : pro improve setup scripts BODY : currently when running setup-seafile-mysql.sh , there are a few issues. firstly, there seems to be no way to specify some of the directories in use during auto setup. for example, when i setup in /opt/seafile , the following are created seemingly with no control from me : /opt/ccnet /opt/conf /opt/logs /opt/pids /opt/pro-data /opt/seahub-data i would like to be able to control these from parameters in the setup script/environment variables, so i can pass through through from docker-compose . additionally, the setup script will hang keep asking when the seafile-data directory already exists. i'm trying to set it up within a docker container, and in mounting the data directory to a docker volume, it will always exist on creation. i could probably work around this by specifying a folder within that volume, but it's a bit of a hack. i'm not sure if this already exists, and i can work around it, but it would be cool if i try and run the setup script again, it tells me it has already been run, and quits out unless it works properly to run it multiple times to reconfigure?
