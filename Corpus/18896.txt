BODY : motivation now that we can enable access to discord to delegate access to a user account, we want to be able to create a secure login where we check upon a session id, hash passwords and more. task implementation - read through victor's readings - create form on the page to listen register. - create a table to store the credentials - create a hasher for the password. - be able to verify that the username isn't already taken by someone else upon submission. - when the checking is good, make sure that the data is added to the table. - view the table to check if it's there. - make sure that the fields are correct. - give them a login token upon completion. wireframe ! screen shot 2017-07-11 at 11 10 48 am https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26865352/28083268-a982653c-6629-11e7-9738-f6c7ef5a5084.png
