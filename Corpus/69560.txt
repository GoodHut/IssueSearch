 URL : "https://github.com/Parean/semester-project/issues/5" TITLE : the name of the project BODY : proposed title is project java wet blanket or jwb . searching on github gave only stange results - almost every repository is empty. jwb may stand for javascript wiki browser, jewish welfare board, john wayne bobbitt, john wilkes booth. i guess that fine if we take such a title as the project name.
