 URL : "https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/issues/1172" TITLE : can params be validated? BODY : is there a way to use the validator bindings to verify a path parameter's format? eg, if the id for a delete should be a uuid: delete /foo/<id> is there a way to make id := c.param id trigger the equivalent to this validate call? validate.var id, uuid thanks.
