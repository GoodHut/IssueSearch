 URL : "https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/317" TITLE : analyzer memory leaks BODY : you can see the dantup.dart file has two separate processes running at the same time and is chewing up a lot of memory. not long after running the below ps aux i checked activity monitor and the process was chewing through 1.9 gb. there seems to be a memory leak. i believe this causes the problem of too many files open in terminal after using this for a day or so. johnbland 90176 0.0 2.3 2937680 381884 ?? s 10:45am 0:19.31 /usr/local/cellar/dart/1.23.0/libexec/bin/dart /usr/local/cellar/dart/1.23.0/libexec/bin/snapshots/analysis_server.dart.snapshot --client-id=dantup.dart-code --client-version=1.4.1 johnbland 90177 0.0 3.7 3781508 626064 ?? s 10:45am 2:12.88 /usr/local/cellar/dart/1.23.0/libexec/bin/dart /usr/local/cellar/dart/1.23.0/libexec/bin/snapshots/analysis_server.dart.snapshot --client-id=dantup.dart-code --client-version=1.4.1
