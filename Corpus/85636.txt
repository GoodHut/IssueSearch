 URL : "https://github.com/voidlinux/void-packages/issues/6746" TITLE : firefox 54 on x86_64-musl BODY : after the latest update to ff 54, on musl, ff is not working. it works fine initially, but after restarting the first time and any subsequent time every tab crashes and prompts for reload which it won't . removing the ~/.mozilla directory temporarily resolves, but again any restart puts it back into the non-working state.
