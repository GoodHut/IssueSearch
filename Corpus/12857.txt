 URL : "https://github.com/lvlup-pro/spawn-frontend-material/issues/172" TITLE : service list api BODY : i have a suggestion, already referring to the api. namely, when we make a query from here https://api.lvlup.pro/docs/ api-service-servicelist , there would be an extra type field, and there would be a type of service. this is useful for interpreting data through the program, because you do not need to perform separate queries for domains, vpss, and other services. for unification, this could be added to any service even if we downloaded them separately .
