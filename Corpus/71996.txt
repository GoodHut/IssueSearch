 URL : "https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/issues/1858" TITLE : are the docs just wrong? BODY : spent a couple hours pulling my hair out today, trying to flash a layout to my planck on my mac. the docs, specifically https://docs.qmk.fm/getting_started_make_guide.html, say to use the make command like: make planck/rev4:default:dfu , with colons. after going through the makefile line by line, i realized that it says to use hyphens, i.e.: the entry point for rule parsing parses a rule in the format <keyboard>-<subproject>-<keymap>-<target> but this particular function only deals with the first <keyboard> part running this, e.g., make planck/rev4-default-dfu works. i'm assuming that osx is enough like linux that the same would be true for that as well. i've opened a pull request about this issue. am i missing something?
