 URL : "https://github.com/tilezen/tapalcatl/issues/41" TITLE : add tilejson handling BODY : the tilejson requests were originally handled by dispatching from fastly, but once the prefix / bucket logic moved to tapalcatl nothing was handling it any more. since tapalcatl is aware of the prefix / bucket mapping, it makes sense to have it be responsible for serving the tilejson files.
