 URL : "https://github.com/jescalan/roots/issues/754" TITLE : before hook promise BODY : hey, i am having an issue with the before hook on app.coffee where the roots compilation doesn't appear to wait for the promise to be resolved before compiling. in an empty roots project, i would expect that this code would cause roots to never compile. axis = require 'axis' rupture = require 'rupture' autoprefixer = require 'autoprefixer-stylus' js_pipeline = require 'js-pipeline' css_pipeline = require 'css-pipeline' promise = -> return new promise resolve, reject -> module.exports = ignores: 'readme.md', ' /layout. ', ' /_ ', '.gitignore', 'ship. conf' extensions: js_pipeline files: 'assets/js/ .coffee' , css_pipeline files: 'assets/css/ .styl' stylus: use: axis , rupture , autoprefixer sourcemap: true 'coffee-script': sourcemap: true before: promise jade: pretty: true this is a problem for me because i am trying to fetch content from an api in multiple requests and i am needing roots to wait until all of the requests have been made before it compiles the site. any help would be much appreciated! thanks,
