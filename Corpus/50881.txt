 URL : "https://github.com/tmrowco/electricitymap/issues/565" TITLE : add data for argentina BODY : if my google-translate spanish is correct, there is hourly generation data on http://portalweb.cammesa.com/memnet1/default.aspx: open operativos on the left, then follow despacho real de generación térmica and despacho real de generación hidráulica . make sure to page through the results. thermal plants will have to be mapped to type, but from other sources, they are mostly/vastly gas, with 6% diesel/oil and no coal. note that thermal also includes a nuclear plan atucnucl . there is some delay, so data for 15:00 local time might not be uploaded until 15:30 or later... additional resources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electricity_sector_in_argentina https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_power_stations_in_argentina
