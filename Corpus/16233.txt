 URL : "https://github.com/JuliaDickey/Red-Sweater-Project-Rails/issues/86" TITLE : icons on homepage BODY : i see these are gone. i know ashley wasn't crazy about them. did you discuss in the meeting? if those were removed intentionally, i think we need to do something more stylized for the three text blocks. they look small and out of place on their own and there is a lot of white space surrounding them now. however, with the new content on the homepage, i think we could remove those altogether. i think you put them there because at the time we needed more visuals on the homepage, but the sentence above it says all the same stuff so it feels somewhat redundant and also competes with the three focuses below.
