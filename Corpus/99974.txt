 URL : "https://github.com/sindresorhus/iterm2-snazzy/issues/1" TITLE : not working in iterm 2.1.4 BODY : i'm trying to import the itermcolors files and while they do show up in the colors-presets list of iterm 2.1.4, selecting the snazzy theme doesn't actually change the colors displayed and doesn't actually work after closing the preferences window. i have been able to install all other itermcolors files that i've tried, including cobalt2, tomorrow night 80s etc.
