 URL : "https://github.com/enpit/chateau-buble/issues/5" TITLE : remove index keys BODY : turns out using the index of a map function does not do any good, see the answer on https://twitter.com/_developit/status/905562416360153088 we should at least remove it, but it would be even better if we would use sth unique. for example in https://github.com/enpit/chateau-buble/blob/f89616d78bc846826df136a632ae118b06faac17/src/components/conversationview.js l45 we could use the message's timestamp instead
