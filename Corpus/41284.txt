 URL : "https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Auth/issues/194" TITLE : .net standard support BODY : feature description with the transition to .net standard it would be great if xamarin.auth were updated to support .net standard. this would also eliminate the need for the bcl dependency which results in the need to add an app.config to fix the bindings in a xamarin project that is consuming other .net standard libraries or is a .net standard library itself.
