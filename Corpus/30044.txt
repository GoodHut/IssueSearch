 URL : "https://github.com/StyleCop/StyleCop/issues/120" TITLE : no files to analyze BODY : i have a .net core 1.1 solution in visual studio 2017 with two projects; a class library and a .net framework 4.6.2 project. stylecop works fine on the class library. however, when i run stylecop on the project it returns with a no files to analyze. there are numerous csharp files in the project and stylecop will successfully run manually on each directory in the project.. all setups are currently default as installed from nuget. how can i get stylecop to run against my whole project?
