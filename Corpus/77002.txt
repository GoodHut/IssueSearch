 URL : "https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-doc/issues/89" TITLE : migrate to openfisca.org BODY : this documentation is only available in english, and we don't intend to translate it anytime soon. even if we were to, it would most probably be as subfolders rather than on fully different domains, to minimise discrepancies, as was the case a few months ago when this doc still had a few outdated pages in french. it should thus be hosted on the openfisca.org domain rather than openfisca.fr . i currently don't see a major reason for having a subdomain for documentation. having doc.openfisca.fr is an artefact of hosting being provided by readthedocs.io with a dns record pointing to their servers. i think we are free to use either a subpath or a subdomain. missing any technical reason for choosing one over another, i've asked twitter https://twitter.com/openfisca/status/898135902467358720 :wink:
