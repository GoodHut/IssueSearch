 URL : "https://github.com/WELTEN/dojo-ibl/issues/279" TITLE : home: no groups feedback BODY : in the home page, when there are no groups for an inquiry we should give feedback to the user. maybe we could say that he/she needs to create a group first in order to see a group there. right now it's confusing. they click and if there are no groups nothing happen and they don't understand.
