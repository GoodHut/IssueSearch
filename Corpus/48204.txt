 URL : "https://github.com/openai/baselines/issues/125" TITLE : replicating ppo paper BODY : i'm going through and trying to replicate everything from the ppo paper. @joschu is there some insight into what parameters/codebase/etc. was used for the a2c work in the paper? i spent a little bit of time trying to modify the atari a2c code for mujoco tasks, but then i thought it might be worth it to ask if there are any plans to release this code in the near future as that would be a more fair effort to replicate the results from the codebase directly i'm getting pretty poor results with my modifications so i'm wondering if i missed something . thanks!
