 URL : "https://github.com/dularion/streama/issues/369" TITLE : embed video request BODY : i was wondering since there site like mp4upload, stream.moe, openload, vidstream, video streaming hosting site etc why not allow these site to be able to embed into the video player like some custom video player do with youtube,vimeo,facebook etc since it would be less costly on bandwith and storage.
