 URL : "https://github.com/semanticvectors/semanticvectors/issues/104" TITLE : model build time BODY : hi - i have been comparing the model build time default rri model on solr 4.10 with solr 5.0. using the same dataset and the same aws windows server, the times are significantly different. solr 4.10 indexes the dataset in 3 minutes, whilst solr 5.0 takes 40 minutes. could be user error of course but i was hoping someone might be able to confirm there is a major difference.
