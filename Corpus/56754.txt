BODY : hello guys, i have a problem, even problems. 1. in my nuxt application, npm run build - takes about 14 minutes - i even can't imagine why assets folder weights 500kb 2. there is one more big problem, all applications components/layouts event which aren't used are loaded, when opening application. https://files.gitter.im/nuxt/nuxt.js/npp9/image.png - i don't want to load 50 mb of components, and especially if they are not used. 3. fresh installation of nuxt when starting npm start again loads all existing components, but when i will open a page, it will load that page components one more time, it's the most strange...
