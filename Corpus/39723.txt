 URL : "https://github.com/meteorwebcomponents/synthesis/issues/20" TITLE : src= src not working BODY : i have an img src and the src is dynamic i.e. using a bound property src . when i change to the correct url, it seems to be prefixing it with the current path i.e as if it was relative. fetched url from chrome debugger network connections : http://localhost:3000/imports/ui/components/asset/asset-thumb/https://diffdot-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/6jrizt8yeakwja2tv.jpg i assume this is something to do with handling assets? what was wrong with putting assets in the public folders? raised by @edge0701
