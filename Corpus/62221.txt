 URL : "https://github.com/dpc/rdedup/issues/131" TITLE : change the repo format. BODY : this will break backward compatibility, and thus should be done in a next major version 3.0 . the current format is kind of lame, and not very efficient especially if random access would be implemented ever . the biggest issue is separate, tiny index files. new format could just keep all chunks in ./data , and count the number of levels of indirections. a saved name would be just a final hash, and number of indirections to follow. also, it seems that a fixed header of a couple of bytes, before every chunk data, would improve debuggability. it could store compression, encryption information so these could be even mixed within the same repo . names should be yml files. easier to upgrade, can contain things like hostname, timestamp etc.
