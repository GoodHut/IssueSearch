 URL : "https://github.com/dikaiosune/rust-dashboard/issues/131" TITLE : what to do with buildbot? BODY : with the recent-ish switch from buildbot to travis + appveyor, the http://rusty-dash.com/nightlies and http://rusty-dash.com/buildbots are kind of broken. i've started writing a scraper to get data from travis to replace the buildbot data and hopefully eventually appveyor too , but it's unclear to me what should fit where: - on http://rusty-dash.com/nightlies, what counts as a successful nightly build for the graph? which travis build is responsible for actually producing a nightly? - how to map travis configuration variables onto builder names ? for the linux builders, things like image=arm-android is pretty obvious. but for the os x builders, it's not obvious what rust_check_target=dist rust_configure_args=\ --target=aarch64-apple-ios,armv7-apple-ios,armv7s-apple-ios,i386-apple-ios,x86_64-apple-ios --enable-extended\ src=. deploy=1 rustc_retry_linker_on_segfault=1 sccache_error_log=/tmp/sccache.log macosx_deployment_target=10.8 macosx_std_deployment_target=10.7 should map to. do you have any guidance here?
