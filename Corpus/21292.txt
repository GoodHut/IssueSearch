 URL : "https://github.com/railsbridge/bridge_troll/issues/537" TITLE : event card updates BODY : these are updates to the individual event cards on the homepage. - convert sign-up buttons to single button that says “sign up & more info” _button should go to the event info page, vs. an rsvp page_ - add region name to each event card _at the top of each card set off, visually. make it a black bar with white text. this will help with the transition when we switch over the visual design._ @careful-with-that-axe is working on this. thx!
