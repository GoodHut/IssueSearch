 URL : "https://github.com/thedatahub/Datahub-Factory/issues/39" TITLE : deprecate tms module BODY : we have tms supported in datahub-factory-arthub https://github.com/thedatahub/datahub-factory-arthub . the current tms solution in datahub-factory banks on the idea that the tms ms sql database is replicated https://github.com/vlaamsekunstcollectie/tmssync to mysql since dbi doesn't allow remote connections to ms sql which is the approach we use within flemish art collection ecosystem. considering a more generic approach instead of the current case specific implementation?
