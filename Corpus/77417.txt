 URL : "https://github.com/aristath/kirki/issues/1556" TITLE : need help creating demos BODY : hi, first of all want to thank you for this beautiful plugin, i really love working with it. i know this is not really a plugin issue but i have been searching to find an answer and i haven't find anything and i was hoping maybe someone could help me solve my issue. so i have been developing a wordpress theme and i have given it a lot of options for the user to customize the site as he sees fit. the problem is how can i show them as a demo? lets say i have this code: kirki::add_field 'my_config', array 'type' => 'select', 'label' => esc_html__ 'job page layout', 'cariera' , 'description' => esc_html__ 'choose the sidebar side for your job page.', 'cariera' , 'section' => 'single_job_option', 'default' => 'right-sidebar', 'priority' => 10, 'choices' => array 'left-sidebar' => esc_attr__ 'left sidebar', 'cariera' , 'right-sidebar' => esc_attr__ 'right sidebar', 'cariera' , 'fullwidth' => esc_attr__ 'no sidebar', 'cariera' , , ; which means the right-sidebar is the default sidebar. but how can i show the left-sidebar and fullwidth as demo pages? i have seen a lot of people doing: mywebsite.com/blog/?sidebar=left-sidebar i would really appreciate it if someone could help me achieve this. best regards, gino
