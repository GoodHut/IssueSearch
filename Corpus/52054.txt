 URL : "https://github.com/esbenp/prettier-vscode/issues/51" TITLE : can't get this to work BODY : installed with vscode 1.9.1 on ubuntu, reloaded, ctrl-shift-p brings up vscode's command palette, it doesn't format the code. typing prettier in the command palette doesn't bring up anything. vscode's problems and output panes don't show anything about prettier, either. exact same problem with vscode 1.10.2 on mac os. i've been using other vscode plugins like standard without problem. what's the trick to get prettier-vscode working? also, cmd-shift-p is by default mapped to the command palette. why use this for formatting?
