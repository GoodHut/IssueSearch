 URL : "https://github.com/asm89/twig-lint/issues/39" TITLE : which rules are linted? BODY : there is an atom linter provider that has twig-lint as prerequisite, so i gave it a try. but my templates do not report any linter warnings or errors , even if i try to do some ugly code. calling twig-lint in cmd line makes no difference. i always get ok in path\filename as an answer. so i have to ask, what rules are checked by the linter?
