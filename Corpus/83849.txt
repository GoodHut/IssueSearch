 URL : "https://github.com/mattgodbolt/compiler-explorer/issues/263" TITLE : command line tool variant BODY : hi -- thanks so much for your contributions! do you have any interest in the following functionality: creating a command line tool variant of compiler explorer that would take source + compiler options + compiler spec and produce a self contained static html that shows thew source + disassembly views sans any support for recompiling or making changes in the editor. i was thinking of integrating this into my build process cmake so that i could fold some results into the documentation of a library. it looks as if some restructuring of the current code would be required -- nothing very complicated but still requiring making at least a handful of concrete decisions. i was going to just fork and refactor+hack, but if this idea seems appealing then perhaps we could try coordinating? cheers, nehal
