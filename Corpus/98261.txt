 URL : "https://github.com/aprilhelsley/tea-cozy/issues/1" TITLE : indentation and whitespace BODY : it is very important to make good use of indentation and white space in your code. right now, everything is on the same indentation level and there is very little space in between them. this makes it difficult to read and edit in the future. try grouping things together like this: <footer> <div class= contact > <h2>the tea cozy</h2> <h5>contact@theteacozy.com</h5> <h5>917-555-8904</h5> </div> <div class= copyright > <h5>copyright the tea cozy 2017</h5> </div> </footer> to clearly see how everything is being organized. https://github.com/aprilhelsley/tea-cozy/blob/master/index.html l1-l3
