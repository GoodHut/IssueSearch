 URL : "https://github.com/KeithYin/mycodes/issues/1" TITLE : u tool is good. but... BODY : but there is a important things that u need generate train_txt file and the test_txt file. if my dataset don't have this file, i can't use this tool. just like cifar dataset. another issue is about imread . matplotlib.pyplot.imread only have good performance on png image. i think you can use 'cv2.imread' or pil in big image data. : above are my personal views. u can close this issue in any time. anyway, i give you a star. 👍
