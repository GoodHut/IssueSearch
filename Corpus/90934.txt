 URL : "https://github.com/crnk-project/crnk-framework/issues/179" TITLE : support compact responses BODY : self and relationship links can make up up to 2/3 of the response payload size. they are not needed for all use cases and for performance sensitive use casesm there should be a possiblity to disable it. possiblities: - extend include/fields parameter handling like a -links - provide configuration flag to disable altogether - introduce http header last one seems the way to go. stays compliant to json api by default. and seems orthonal to the include/fields parameter. links other than self/related should not be affected by this altough further parameterization of the degree of compactness might be desirable
