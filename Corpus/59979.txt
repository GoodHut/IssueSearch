 URL : "https://github.com/googlegenomics/dsub/issues/42" TITLE : viewing preempted jobs BODY : having set the --preemptible tag on a dsub command, is there an easy way of viewing which jobs have been preempted on the google compute engine? i note that occasionally the dstat command will show status 14: vm jobid stopped unexpectedly. is this possibly due to preemption? thanks!
