 URL : "https://github.com/selvinortiz/craft.doxter/issues/29" TITLE : conflict with typogrify BODY : i have the craft-typogrify plugin https://github.com/jamiepittock/craft-typogrify installed, and after installing doxter in the cp, i get this error: fatal error : cannot redeclare smarty_modifier_smartypants previously declared in path_to_project/dist/craft/plugins/doxter/common/parsedown/typography.php:311 in path_to_project/dist/craft/plugins/typogrify/lib/smartypants.php on line 68 and now i can't even access the cp without deleting the files. i'm a total n00b at php, but i think both are using the same framework or something. any advice/workarounds?
