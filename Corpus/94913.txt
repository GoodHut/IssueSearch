 URL : "https://github.com/webpack/webpack.js.org/issues/1367" TITLE : comparison is hard to read BODY : i was tring to read the comparison page https://webpack.js.org/comparison/ , but the table displaying the comparison is forced to a percentage of the page, while theres open room on the left and right sides. i check the source file https://github.com/webpack/webpack.js.org/blob/master/content/comparison.md for the page and it seem's the size of the table here is also limited, but only because of github's page layout. is this the same for the website page? if so, can you consider making a slight change to the layout so that the comparison table is readable.
