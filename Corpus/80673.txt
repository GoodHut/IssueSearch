 URL : "https://github.com/2ndQuadrant/pglogical/issues/118" TITLE : unusual slow replication BODY : hi. have to replicate one table 180gb in size from pg 9.5.4 to 9.6.3. it starts normally, and at around 20gb of data replicated, it starts to be very slowly. it took 96h to replicate 119gb, and it behave strange when i'm looking at df -h it show 119gb, then it drops to 118, and it can do so several times. i have max_wal_size = 10gb , not sure if i can do anything else. i've been replicating db's with more then 300gb, and it all was fine still, there were more tables, then just one is there anything i can do to speed up process?
