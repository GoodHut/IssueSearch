 URL : "https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2178" TITLE : callback on app.run BODY : when writing local-only apps we want to open the web browser after the flask app starts up. currently we do: threading.timer 1.25, lambda: webbrowser.open url .start app.run port=port however it would be nice not to have a guessed time like 1.25 , also it would be nice for the opening of the browser to be cancelled incase starting the flask app fails. app.run port=port, onstart=lambda: webbrowser.open url
