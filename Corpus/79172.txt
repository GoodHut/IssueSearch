 URL : "https://github.com/gdiscordbot/gdiscordbot-core/issues/2" TITLE : runtime plugin reloading BODY : plugins should be able to be re-loaded without killing and running a new instance of the bot. in addition, plugins should be given some additional state indicating when they're in the middle of a critical task and should not be allowed to be reloaded. in this state, should the bot core queue plugins that are busy for re-loading later on? wait for an onready event or similar
