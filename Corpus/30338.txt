 URL : "https://github.com/watir/watir/issues/608" TITLE : page object support BODY : now that cheezy has implemented page object gem entirely from watir, i think there are several methods / aliases we can use to remove code from po gem. essentially there are things that i think belong in watir not a po gem. i'll start making prs when i see them to both projects. i'll need po team buy in as well, but this is something i'm hoping we i can get out sooner rather than later.
