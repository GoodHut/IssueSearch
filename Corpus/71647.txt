 URL : "https://github.com/bradygaster/azure-tools-vscode/issues/16" TITLE : add support for keyvault BODY : this is a feature request and one that i would personally like to take on. happy to fork and send a pr for now instead of joining the contributors list at this point anyway azure key vault is fully supported in the .net sdk and i've done quite a bit of work with it so keen to extend my knowledge and help make this vs code extension better :
