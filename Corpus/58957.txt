 URL : "https://github.com/krakenjs/generator-swaggerize/issues/105" TITLE : supported node version BODY : is this module suppose to run under node 0.12 and 4? just realized that the swagmock module, which is used by the generator, is already at version 1.0.0. i was close to make a pr that bumps this version, but since swagmock 1.0.0 requires node >6 this would also affect the supported version of this module.
