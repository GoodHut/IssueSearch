 URL : "https://github.com/opencb/opencga/issues/759" TITLE : create admin webservices BODY : opencga has different command lines for administrators and general users. the user command line relies on the webservices to run every query. however, the administrator command line can only be run in the node where opencga is installed to have direct access to the database. though this works perfectly fine, it would make things easier if administrators would also have some dedicated webservices from within they could perform any administrative action. as so, the idea is to create the following additional webservices matching the commands from the opencga-admin.sh command line. - .../admin/catalog|db /clean /stats /jwt meta - .../admin/users/ /create /import /sync /root - .../admin/audit/ /query?action=login /groupby /stats - .../admin/tools/ /install /list /show
