 URL : "https://github.com/robtweed/ewd-qoper8/issues/7" TITLE : build.js refactoring ideas BODY : hi @robtweed what do you think if move build https://github.com/robtweed/ewd-qoper8/blob/master/lib/build.js information to package.json? in this case we will have only one place with version in the module. 1. no -> package.json->version 2. date -> package.json->config->date more about config here https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json config in this case we can have the following js var pkg = require '../package.json' var build = { no: pkg.version, date: pkg.config.date, }; module.exports = build;
