 URL : "https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y-ci/issues/36" TITLE : --config option example? BODY : i'm having trouble figuring out how to use a config file with a simple command line test or whether one can . i need to go to a url, click a link, and test the resulting page. let's say it's the more information... link on http://example.com which goes to https://www.iana.org/domains/reserved . with this saved in example-test.json pa11y { actions: 'click element body > div > p:nth-child 3 > a', 'wait for url to be https://www.iana.org/domains/reserved' } ; i would expect that pa11y -c example-test.json http://example.com would output the results for https://www.iana.org/domains/reserved 25 errors , but instead i just get the results for example.com 1 error , as if there was no config file. the examples and sample code are either ambiguous or seem to be aimed at running tests from your own js so i'm having a hard time seeing what's wrong.
