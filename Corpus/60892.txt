 URL : "https://github.com/stefanpenner/broccoli-concat-analyser/issues/11" TITLE : add parallelism support BODY : when uglifying, we end up being quite cpu bound, and large projects likely suffer. using: worker pool -> https://github.com/josdejong/workerpool and maybe async-promise-queue -> https://github.com/stefanpenner/async-promise-queue we can likely improve throughput. that being said, it will require some testing and tuning for sure.
