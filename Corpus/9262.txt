-- ~shriram --- @kyessenov commented on tue aug 01 2017 https://github.com/istio/old_pilot_repo/issues/977 issuecomment-319534372 unfortunately, the pod ip address is not stable. the downward api to get pod ip at startup is not reliable after all, despite being an api . i doubt you can reproduce it on a regular gke cluster, a custom cni plugin might be necessary to trigger this problem.
