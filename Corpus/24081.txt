 URL : "https://github.com/d0k3/GodMode9/issues/135" TITLE : sd card corruption BODY : i'm back again with a much more serious issue. i'm not sure if this has happened before, and i searched for a similar case, but got nothing. i eject my sd card safely every time, so i know it wasn't my computer. what you can see showed up after i returned the card to my 3ds. the cia files i moved remained intact, strangely enough. ! snap000 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29241060/28751481-9a1e4bcc-74bd-11e7-9a93-f80d48f4fac8.png
