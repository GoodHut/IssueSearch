 URL : "https://github.com/ucdavis/Namster/issues/37" TITLE : filtering not working BODY : take for example https://namstr.ucdavis.edu/search/entomology. i get good results back, and on the left side i get filters. however when i select the filter it doesn't filter down to just those results. for example, the hutch filter says there should be 9 results, but when i click on it and get https://namstr.ucdavis.edu/search/entomology?building=hutch, there are other buildings shown in that list, and the filter numbers also don't look right anymore.
