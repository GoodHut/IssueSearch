 URL : "https://github.com/ThomasGerstenberg/serial_monitor/issues/83" TITLE : write line autocomplete BODY : it would be nice for the write line input box to have autocomplete functionality, allowing users to start typing in previous lines/commands/whatever and have autocomplete suggestions. page up/down through history works, however it can be a pain when the history grows to large sizes.
