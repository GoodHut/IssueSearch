 URL : "https://github.com/grimly/Toolbox/issues/11" TITLE : jaxrs proxy based client BODY : implement a method that would take a javax.ws.rs.client.webtarget and an interface java.lang.class instance and return an implementation that would act as a client for the given endpoint interface. this tool must only rely on the jaxrs 2.0 api. this is motivated by the fact that all similar solutions from jaxrs solutions also are dependant on their implementation.
