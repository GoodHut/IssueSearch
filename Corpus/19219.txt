 URL : "https://github.com/apereo/dotnet-cas-client/issues/67" TITLE : .net core support? BODY : asp.net core has a very different authentication format which is built on the microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication namespace you can see their code here: https://github.com/aspnet/security . they already provide many pre-built authentication providers, including oauth, oidc, jwt, facebook, google, etc, and other people have written extensions to bring in even more providers. as far as i can tell there are no working cas providers for .net core 2.0 the current version , and i'm wondering if this project has considered building against this new set of apis and publishing a .net standard library so it can be used in .net standard & core apps. the end result would look something like this services.addauthentication .addcas casoptions => { ... } ; thanks for your consideration!
