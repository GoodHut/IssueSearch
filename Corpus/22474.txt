 URL : "https://github.com/sateffen/nodgine/issues/47" TITLE : limit request body BODY : currently, the complete request body is written to a buffer. that allows an attacker to set a request body with more than 1gb, which exhausts the complete memory, and crashes the server. there should be a configurable limit, which protects the process from to huge request bodys. a limit should be set to 4mb, 8mb or 10mb.
