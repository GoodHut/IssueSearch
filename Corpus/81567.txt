 URL : "https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/196" TITLE : 'scrolltotop' not working BODY : when navigating between the pages it seems to always maintain the same position as before. i've set 'scrolltotop: true' for all pages even though that is done by default , and for my dynamic page that loads data from the vuex store. the router setup looks as follows export default new router { mode: 'history', base: '/', linkactiveclass: 'nuxt-link-active', scrollbehavior, routes: { path: / , component: _628e917c, name: index }, { path: /studio , component: _e2b616c8, name: studio }, { path: /contact , component: _2afe8d6c, name: contact }, { path: /:projects/:slug? , component: _17dc14fe, name: projects-slug } }
