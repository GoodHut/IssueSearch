 URL : "https://github.com/wonder-mice/zf_log/issues/16" TITLE : thread safety ? BODY : hi, i'm interested in this library but have a few questions regarding thread safety. the readme says it is thread-safe , but what happens when a thread writes a log message while the output callback is already in progress called from a another thread ? i don't see any explicit locking / queuing in the built-in output callbacks... - stderr with writefile win : i admit i can't find much documentation on using writefile with stderr, but how can you tell if file_append_data or file_write_data are set ? - stderr with write nix ; the code comments that the usage is atomic, but posix says a write is atomic if the whole amount written in one operation is not interleaved with data from any other process. -- so, ok for multiple processes, but multiple threads ? - outputdebugstring on win32 is probably async safe, i read somewhere that it uses a mutex internally? not 100% sure about this though, and it's not quite what i'm looking for. i know there has been some testing with multiple threads, so maybe i'm just missing something ? i'd like to hear more about this. thanks!
