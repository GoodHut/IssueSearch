 URL : "https://github.com/vim-syntastic/syntastic/issues/1996" TITLE : issues with scalac BODY : when using vim + syntastic for scala development, the scalac compiler does not seem to work properly: some errors and warnings aren't reported, even when actually present. however, some are: mainly, anything written outside class/object definitions which, given the nature of the language, isn't really that useful . when running :syntasticinfo i can see that scalac is enabled and active, so i can't seem to be able to explain this strange behavior. my vim version is 7.4.1689 on linux mint 18.1, and scalac version is 2.12.1 latest version at the time of writing, downloaded directly from the official website and not from mint's repos . no issues so far with other compilers and checkers for other languages, including, but not limited to: gcc, g++, javac, pylint, sbcl, ghc, ocaml.
