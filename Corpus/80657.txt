 URL : "https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j/issues/345" TITLE : unkown board with pi 0 w BODY : error ==>> serial setup failed : unsupported/unknown board type; unable to detect hardware. i have tried the exact same code on a pi 3 and it all worked fine. to do so i just removed the sd card from the pi 0w and put it in the pi 3 and it all worked as expected. what could be done about this ? i am using the latest realsed version of the library, not the snapshot. thanks
