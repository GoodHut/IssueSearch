 URL : "https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/ark-explorer/issues/24" TITLE : restore the restful api BODY : the explorer used to provide a restful api with some useful endpoints. these have now changed to websockets. a few of my applications have broken as a result, and most developers won't implement websockets since it's fat vs rest. please can we bring the restful api back alongside websockets? @luciorubeens
