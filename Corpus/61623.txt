 URL : "https://github.com/Hetal728/MCGalaxy/issues/371" TITLE : better sorting in /cmds BODY : fabthezen> have you thought of making it so that when you type /commands rank it only shows commands of that specific rank? fabthezen> it's more useful for all ranks, when you rank up you can just do /commands to see all available commands or /commands yourrank to see the new ones fabthezen> the higher you go with ranks the spammier the list'd get fabthezen> maybe you should sort them by rank by default e.e unknownshadow200> the default sorting is by category. fabthezen> tbh that kind of sorting doesn't help the eye, but okay fabthezen> i can tell they're not sorted by name, yes ^- maybe lines for the different categories/ranks
