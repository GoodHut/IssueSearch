 URL : "https://github.com/ibus/ibus/issues/1945" TITLE : delete files under debian BODY : hi, i am a debian ibus maintainer. in short, please erase everything under debian directory including the directory itself. tl;dl as i understand, im-switch is not used any more in debian nor ubuntu. so https://github.com/ibus/ibus/tree/master/debian showing readme.source is incorrect. also packaging style is so outdated and useless. we use new dh syntax for debian/rules and we have multi arch things. besides, debian prefers upstream not to include debian directory in the source. even if you do, it will not be used. it only confuses git repository management. thanks for consideration. osamu
