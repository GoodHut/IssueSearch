 URL : "https://github.com/BioNinja/GSEApy/issues/37" TITLE : nans in ssgsea nes BODY : hi, i have run ssgsea using gseapy, the es values i get are ok, but when i look at the nes values in some cases i get a nan. i checked the corresponding es values and they are not 0. for example in one case i have an es == 327.7 and the nes == nan. and this doesn't seem to relate to the geneset, because for the same geneset other samples have an es and a numerical nes as expected. is this a bug? happy to provide some sample dat if required. best, alejandro
