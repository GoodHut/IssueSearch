 URL : "https://github.com/google/spatial-media/issues/185" TITLE : 4:20 limitation bug BODY : i've got a .mp4 h264 which lasts 5:39. after injecting 360 metadata to my video with the tool, seems to last the same... but when i upload it to youtube or even vimeo, they both last 4:20. i assume that's a bug, which automatically injects some kind of duration metadata value into the video.
