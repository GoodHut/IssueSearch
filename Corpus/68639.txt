 URL : "https://github.com/andrewiankidd/Plextras.js/issues/10" TITLE : self hosted auto update BODY : i just saw that new auto update feature! that looks awesome! i would love to host my own fork on my domain so i can auto update with my own settings. would it be difficult to add a quick guide to the process? the main reason im asking about this, is because i just updated plex to latest public release, and i can't seem to get plextras running again. i'm getting failed to load resource with a 404 not found status in console. if you have any idea what is causing this, i would appreciate the help, but i mainly would like to get a simple auto upgrade system in place so this isn't an issue everytime plex updates. thanks again!
