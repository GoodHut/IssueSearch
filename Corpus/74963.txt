 URL : "https://github.com/thememachine/eleven/issues/162" TITLE : focus styling on toolbar BODY : the issue is: similar issue to 160, but on the very top level. on the toolbar manage, shortcuts, etc if you use your keyboard to tab, you will see no visible focus indicator. a quick code snippet shows that outline is set to none, which is something you want to remedy right away. this goes beyond just an accessibility issue, this should be considered a ux issue as well as it is difficult to tell where you are on the page. sample code in your project where outline is set to none: toolbar-bar nav a, toolbar-bar .menu a, toolbar-bar .toolbar-icon, toolbar-bar .toolbar-menu a { outline: none; } where url all admin level pages. todo you can easily reset all focus indicator styles to use the default browser styles: { outline: auto 2px highlight; // for non-webkit browsers outline: auto 5px -webkit-focus-ring-color; // for webkit browsers } or you can create a global focus style for all elements that matches your site theme a bit more. the key is to 1. have a visual focus indicator and 2. keep it as consistent as possible for all the different elements. see this component for more details: http://a11y-style-guide.com/style-guide/section-general.html kssref-general-link-focus
