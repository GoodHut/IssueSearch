 URL : "https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/4969" TITLE : standardize file naming BODY : file naming conventions in jest can be improved. a good example is the integration_tests folder. we have: dashed names: auto-clear-mocks underscored names: clear_cache camel case names: testnamepattern dash + camel case names: timer-resetmocks underscore + camel case names: stack_trace_no_capturestacktrace ? names: regex- char-in-path i understand that some of the camel cased ones reference actual method names, like capturestacktrace , but i think we could do it better. this is absolutely not top-priority, but i just wanted to add a task to it because it feels there's room for improvement.
