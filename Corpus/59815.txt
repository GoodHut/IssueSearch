 URL : "https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv/issues/404" TITLE : use sh instead of bash BODY : we've ran into an issue where using ajv with the alpine base in docker causes a crash that does not happen in the debian base see https://github.com/nodejs/docker-node/issues/288 . i have not been able to create a minimal reproducer, so i was hoping that running the tests against the alpine base would shed some light on the issue unfortunately it didn't . however, in order to get the tests to run, i had to switch the shell scripts from using bash to sh , and since there's not bash specific functionality in the scripts, they can be switched to sh without any issues. here's the dockerfile that i used to run the tests and if this were changed, then the sed would not be necessary: from node:6.9.4-alpine run mkdir -p /usr/src/app workdir /usr/src/app run apk add --no-cache git run git clone https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv.git . run npm install --quiet run git submodule update --init run for f in scripts/bundle scripts/prepare-tests; do sed -i s/bash/sh/ $f; done cmd npm , test i ran these commands to build the container and run the tests: docker build -t test_ajv . docker run --rm test_ajv it's probably also worth noting that the test-karma times out because phantomjs isn't working with alpine linux see https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/14186 .
