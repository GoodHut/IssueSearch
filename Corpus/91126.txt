 URL : "https://github.com/awslabs/landsat-on-aws/issues/12" TITLE : switching node.js runtime BODY : aws lambda recently accepts node v4.3. i am running serverless v0.5.0 with node v4.3 but i still get the following error: serverless: us-west-2 ------------------------ serverless: landsat-path: the runtime parameter of nodejs is no longer supported for creating or updating aws lambda functions. we recommend you use the new runtime nodejs4.3 while creating or updating functions. /usr/local/lib/node_modules/serverless/node_modules/bluebird/js/release/async.js:61 fn = function { throw arg; }; ^ i've gone through some of the package.json files in hopes that changing the node versions there would help.
