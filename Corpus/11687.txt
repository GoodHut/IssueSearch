BODY : hi, i'm wondering whether this project is dead. i needed to use rediscluster, but its implementation is far from being neat as it creates new actorsystem per connection. in case this project is still alive, i can send a pr some time later which reuses same actorsystem among connections to each node as well as allows pass client's owned actorsystem.
