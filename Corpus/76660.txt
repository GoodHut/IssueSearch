 URL : "https://github.com/waterlink/rack-reverse-proxy/issues/40" TITLE : location getting mangled BODY : my rails app is on example.com, my wordpress blog is hosted on blog.example.com, and i'm using rack-reverse-proxy to stream the blog through example.com/blog. i'm using force_ssl so i also have replace_response_host . most things are working pretty well, but on some wordpress actions the location afterward gets mangled. example: wordpress produces: users.php?update=add&id=16 rack-reverse-proxy rewrites it as: http://example.comusers.php?update=add&id=16 the full url should be: http://example.com/blog/wp-admin/users.php?update=add&id=16 backing up a bit: i'm actually not sure what standalone replace_response_host is useful for, or why it ever has to run other than when redirecting http -> https . let me know what you think and i'll try to contribute a pr, either to code or documentation. thanks for a ðŸŒˆsuper helpfulâœ¨ project!
