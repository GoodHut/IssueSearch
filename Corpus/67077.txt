 URL : "https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/issues/1386" TITLE : optimise session writes BODY : make it configurable to optimize session writes: currently sessions will always be written to persistent storage once the last simultaneous request exits, even if the only thing that changed on the session is the lastaccesstime/expiry time. a configurable mechanism that eg only writes the session if it is dirty, or if some amount of time has passed since the lastaccess time was updated would be desirable.
