BODY : is there a way to combine genlight objects? specifically, if i simulate multiple genlight objects under different ancestral conditions, can i combine these and have them identified as different @pop s? alternatively, could i create one genlight object but have different @pop s within this object that are simulated based on specific ancestral conditions? it seems like the latter could be achieved using the sort.pop command, but i have several populations that i want to combine each is simulated based on ancestral conditions , so this might be complicated. here is a simplified example: pop1_sim <- glsim 100, n.snp.nonstruc=200, ploidy=2 ; pop2_sim <- glsim 100, n.snp.nonstruc=300, ploidy=2 then i want to put these two simulated populations into one genlight object.
