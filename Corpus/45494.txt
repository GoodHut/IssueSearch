BODY : hi, ocornut! i was wondering if there was any possible method of accomplishing an image-button with dynamic/imgui text. the only real idea i had was overlapping a text widget and an imagebutton widget, but imgui doesn't seem to support overlapping very well. any ideas as to how i could go about accomplishing this?
