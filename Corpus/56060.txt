 URL : "https://github.com/tomnieuwland/clubhaus-php/issues/53" TITLE : mass multi-club events BODY : cse can create event. students can see event on calendar but don't need to register. execs should receive info on the event e.g. info, whats supplied, what they need to bring/do execs should register that they're club will participate. this info goes to cse and the reports page under approved events i guess???
