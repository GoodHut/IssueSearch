 URL : "https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/issues/516" TITLE : lemma of abbreviation BODY : spawned off of 513 and universaldependencies/ud_english 40. i proposed: > another issue relevant here is abbreviations. for uncommon abbreviations/shortened forms like w for with , btwn for btwn , thru for through , i'm inclined to say we should use the canonical spelling in the lemma and apply the feature abbr=yes . for common abbreviations like vs. for versus and etc. for et cetera , perhaps we should keep the surface form in the lemma. there has been further discussion about single-token abbreviations that would expand to multiple words, and whether to expand frequent single-word abbreviations.
