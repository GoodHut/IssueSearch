 URL : "https://github.com/oduwsdl/wsdlthesis/issues/19" TITLE : provide an index of todos BODY : akin to the figures, tables, etc. indices at the beginning of a document, it would be helpful to have an index of all of the todos in the document. as far as i can tell, they are not currently indexed using the current mechanism but maybe we could build this index into the todo command and provide this index as a sort of checklist to the writer.
