 URL : "https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-php-driver/issues/565" TITLE : sorting command options BODY : for now \mongodb\driver\command requires the command name to be the first key in options, passed to it. for example: php // will work $command = new \mongodb\driver\command 'aggregate' => 'my_collection_name', 'pipeline' => $pipeline, ; // will not work $command = new \mongodb\driver\command 'pipeline' => $pipeline, 'aggregate' => 'my_collection_name', ; this leads to some complexities when writing userland driver library. for example, in my library https://github.com/tequila/mongodb-php-lib i use modification of the symfony optionsresolver https://github.com/symfony/options-resolver component, but i cannot simply use it as is, since it may reorder options, and command name will not be the first key in resulting array. do you have plans to add support for unordered set in command options?
