 URL : "https://github.com/omeka/omeka-s/issues/870" TITLE : main and additional sites BODY : hi, currently, omeka s allows to define a main page, but not a main site. this may be useful in many cases where there is only one digital library for an institution, in particular the smaller ones, and when there are a main site and additional specific collections. the main issue is that it implies to remove the s/:siteslug , that is useless with a single or a main site, and to keep it only for additional sites. so i was wondering if such a feature is planned, or if it is possible to pull requests for it, or if it is preferable to create a module that adds some routes and override some other ones but because it is a core feature, i don't know if a module can do it . sincerely, daniel berthereau infodoc & knowledge management
