 URL : "https://github.com/nh13/TMAP/issues/1" TITLE : iupac ambiguity codes BODY : there's a paragrah describing how to handle abiguous dna bases, but i don't understand why r is converted to c, can you explain this? ambiguous iupac codes in the reference/target fasta will be converted to the lexico- graphically smallest dna base that is not compatible to the iupac code to ensure mini- mum reference bias. for example, an iupac base r, which represents an a or a g, will be converted to a c. all ns in the reference will be converted to as. furthermore, any non- iupac character will be treated as an n. the ambiguity codes will only be re-considered when calculating the nm and md sam record optional tags.
