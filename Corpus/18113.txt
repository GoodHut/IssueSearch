 URL : "https://github.com/facebookincubator/facebook-for-woocommerce/issues/18" TITLE : site speed issues BODY : i am using this plugin with paid campaign but i am facing a lot of site speed issues because my site requests increased. this plugin adds 10, 12 live requests due to these live requests my server response time increased as well as load time and page size increased. due to this, our clients complain us about our site speed in most countries site load time greater than 15sec. i have tested my site on different hosting server. we have vps only for this site but all in vain. currently, we have uploaded our site into cloud server but getting same results.
