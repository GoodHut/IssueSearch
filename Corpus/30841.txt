 URL : "https://github.com/01org/camera-streaming-daemon/issues/45" TITLE : reduce lag on video BODY : we've recently enabled the mp to be able to receive the video streams from csd. it can be tested using this: - install latest version of mp http://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-install-mission-planner.html - ensure you're using beta version - config/tuning >> planner >> beta updates checkbox - help >> check for beta updates - ensure the companion computer running csd and pc can reach each other on the network somehow - on mp, select udp and connect - open flight data screen, press ctrl-x. a video selection window should appear. select the format you'd like. this is quite beta so every available combination of format and resolution is displayed the issue is that the lag on the video stream is quite bad. at least 2 seconds. i suspect that the gstreamer pipeline isn't optimised. in apsync's simple video system we use a pipeline like this: gst-launch-1.0 -v v4l2src device=/dev/video0 ! video/x-raw,framerate=30/1 ! omxh264enc ! video/x-h264, stream-format= string byte-stream ! rtph264pay ! udpsink host=10.0.1.97 port=5600 there are probably better gstreamer pipelines but the above is at least an improvement i think.
