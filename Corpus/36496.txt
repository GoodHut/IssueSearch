 URL : "https://github.com/biesbjerg/ngx-translate-extract/issues/29" TITLE : how does clean work? BODY : hi, i'm currently trying out ngx-translate-extract by doing: ngx-translate-extract --input ./src --output ./src/assets/i18n/se.pot --clean --sort --format pot if i first have three strings in a .ts-file, and run the extractor, i see the three strings in my se.pot-file. so it all seems to be working fine. if i then remove one of the strings from my application and run the extractor again, is it supposed to remove the now not used string from the .pot-file, since it is no longer in use? i got that impression from reading the documentation about --clean : > remove obsolete strings when merging thanks!
