 URL : "https://github.com/s-panferov/awesome-typescript-loader/issues/482" TITLE : exclude file from checker BODY : i have a project that runs aot in production and jit in development, as any other aot project my main.aot.ts file reads the main module factory using import { appmodulengfactory } from '../aot/src/app/app.module.ngfactory'; this however generates an error during development, even if my aot file is included only in production build i don't see it in development's webpack module tree the checker plugin still tries to compile it throwing the error as the factory doesn't exists because i'm in development mode. is there a way to tell the checker to exclude a file?
