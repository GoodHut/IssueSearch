 URL : "https://github.com/siacs/Conversations/issues/2615" TITLE : x-oob opt out BODY : i am actually setting up my own home automation system. as per adding xep 0066 it is no longer possible for me sent pic to see inband as conversations needs this header. unfrtunately the author of the httpupload cli is inactive. so my last try here if it is possible having this security feature opt out. i would like having this deactivated.
