 URL : "https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/issues/2221" TITLE : add hv.html element? BODY : linked streams in holoviews make it feasible to make richly linked interactive apps, where hovering or clicking in one plot can control which information is shown in other plots. e.g. the tap http://holoviews.org/reference/streams/bokeh/tap.html example shows how a click on a heatmap can open an associated curve, and the landsat example https://bokeh.github.io/datashader-docs/topics/landsat.html shows how to do the same by just hovering. this functionality is really powerful, but it's limited by the scope of what can be contained in a holoviews element, and so what can be linked right now are just plots and tables. it could be very useful to be able to bring up arbitrary html information, if we add an hv element that can accept arbitrary html-renderable content as its .data. such content might include a textual description of a selected data point, a news article about that item, some web page links associated with it, and so on -- anything that can be put into a <div> and displayed along with the main plot. bokeh should be able to handle arbitrary html like this, but the matplotlib renderer would not have an html parser, in which case it could possibly show the .data characters as a plot with a text annotation, just to give it some value under mpl as well. it's not ideal, but exploiting the power of html for formatting and hyperlinking in the bokeh case seems to override the goal of having the backends have similar functionality.
