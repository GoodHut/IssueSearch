 URL : "https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-scrollpoint/issues/18" TITLE : problem in small screens BODY : hi, i have a fixed element inside a scrollable container, to make this work i had to put ui-scrollpoint-target in the container. this works great in a desktop. the problem is, when the page is in a mobile size screen, the container no longer controls the scroll, now the body is controlling the scroll and the fixed element doesn't work, probably because is listening to the ui-scrollpoint-target of the container that is no longer controlling the scroll. any advice on this? thanks!
