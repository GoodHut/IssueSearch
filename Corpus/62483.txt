 URL : "https://github.com/mvdan/unparam/issues/5" TITLE : common linter interface BODY : i propose that all go linters that work on vanilla x/tools/go/loader go/ast + go/types and x/tools/go/ssa implement an interface, to allow running multiple of them at once while sharing parsing, type-checking and ssa work. the interface could be something like: type checker interface{ check loader.program, ssa.program warning, error } type warning struct { pos token.pos msg string } each linter would have an importable package with a type satisfying this interface.
