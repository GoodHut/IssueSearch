 URL : "https://github.com/upper/db/issues/370" TITLE : postgres pk uuid type BODY : hi, issue upper.io/db.v3 panics after running insertreturning or updatereturning on a table/entity that has a pk of type uuid example code and ouput https://gist.github.com/jonnypillar/c0bd4a6af69ee0d8d25c74fd6b9dcde9 details - upper db version: 3.1.0 - go version: 1.8.1 the issue seems to come down to https://github.com/upper/db/blob/master/internal/sqladapter/sqladapter.go l36 after performing the insert/update it runs through col.find id .one newitem https://github.com/upper/db/blob/v3/internal/sqladapter/collection.go l166 . the id that is passed in here is of type uint8 . when upper goes to check that the key type is valid https://github.com/upper/db/blob/v3/internal/sqladapter/collection.go l90 , it returns false because it isn't in the list of accepted types. if add the uint8 to https://github.com/upper/db/blob/master/internal/sqladapter/sqladapter.go l36 then it all works fine and theres no panic. is there a specific reason why uuids are not supported or is just been missed out. if you need any more information or details let me know üëç thanks
