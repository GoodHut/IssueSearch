 URL : "https://github.com/spacetelescope/braindump/issues/23" TITLE : advanced git workflow BODY : i see this topic as distinct from github workflows, although there will probably be some overlap. i think it would be useful to talk about how git can be used locally to aid a development workflow, and some of the more 'advanced' git features that not all users may be aware of, including: - git gui - git grep - git reset - git rebase - git reflog - git rerere it might also be useful to talk about git integration with shell environments, including plugins that allow for tab completion of git commands and commits.
