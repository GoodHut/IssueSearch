 URL : "https://github.com/itdelatrisu/opsu/issues/291" TITLE : osz map can't load BODY : because of gfw and i'm in china, i don't have the right to use the online maps, so i download the maps from the official website of osu!, but many maps can't be imported to the software, just say failed. could you fix the bug? could you give me a more convenient way to get the maps?
