 URL : "https://github.com/jeremyletang/rust-sfml/issues/164" TITLE : creating fonts on the heap BODY : i'm using rust-sfml and i'd like to encapsulate all my rendering into a renderer struct that has methods like handle_events , draw , etc., so none of the rest of my code needs to worry about rendering. https://gist.github.com/dfannius/963d17ca466ceb00373dfbb680a862e1 shows a minimal example of the issue i'm running into. i'd like the renderer to do all its resource acquisition on construction, but if i create a font inside new , it doesn't live long enough. i'd like to create it on the heap and give text an rc<font>, but text as currently implemented doesn't support that. as it is, i can pass a &font into the constructor, but that just moves the problem up one level the renderer can't live outside of the enclosing function . anyway, i don't know what the best solution is, but that is my use case.
