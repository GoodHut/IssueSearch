 URL : "https://github.com/notnullxyz/arid-grazer/issues/6" TITLE : endpoint: update user BODY : the route: $app->put '/user/{uniq}', $apiversion.'\usercontroller@update' ; requires implementation on usercontroller and grazerredisservice it could be patch too, if this feels more correct, and maybe it is, since a patch would allow, patching of single fields. consider and implment this endpoint : do some homework, which http method suites this best, and implement whatever is needed to allow updating a user. at this point, the only updatable field, is probably email ? please check.
