 URL : "https://github.com/canidlogic/nelsc/issues/3" TITLE : improve readme file BODY : the project currently has only a minimal readme file that doesn't say anything useful. this needs to be updated to provide an explanation of the software, an overview of the calendar system, and some basic documentation. however, the overview of the calendar system should just be the basic rules. the readme file is not the place for a justification or rationale for the calendar system.
