BODY : description it seems like there isn't currently an easy to use, self-contained viterbi decoder package in python. am i wrong? did i miss something obvious? viterbi does seem to be in scope, if librosa is intended to be a library of useful things for audio analysis. it's certainly no further afield than, say, dtw. so, what do folks think about adding this in a future version? some desirable features from my point of view: - focus on the discriminative case ie., linear chain crf , not the generative case ie., hmm . this means that i would want something that consumes a matrix of state likelihoods over time not emission probabilities . - helper functions to construct simple transition matrix priors uniform, self-loop, clock, etc . - optional initial state distribution. - numerically stable. - numba-friendly. anything else? fwiw, i have a prototype that checks about half of these boxes, but i don't intend to get it polished in time to make it into 0.6. maybe 0.6.1 or 0.7.0.
