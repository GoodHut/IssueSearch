 URL : "https://github.com/dbrgn/RPLCD/issues/60" TITLE : defaults for gpio BODY : the default pins for gpio should be removed. its really dangerous. i have accidentially run code several times with default pins. and with sensors, motordrivers etc connected to the pi. im just lucky that nothing broke. the user should explicitly have to set these manually. these defaults seem obsolete from the beginning ofta the project with only one configuration. also. gpio mode gpio.board as defaults should be removed or changed to gpio.bcm that is way more used. cant actually remember to have seen a project with gpio.board as default.
