 URL : "https://github.com/alexbruy/processing-circuitscape/issues/6" TITLE : plugin doesn't show up BODY : hi alex, sorry to add a new issue on the unable to install plugin list but, after installing it, nothing appears in the 'processing options -> providers' menu. i saw that in the issues raised previously it was due to the processing version, but here i'm starting from a fresh installation of 2.18.14 on w10. any hint on where to look for the cause? thank you in advance
