 URL : "https://github.com/z-kit/z-input/issues/5" TITLE : travis + selenium error BODY : the regression tests of z-kit components have been flakey recently. need to investigate this further. the logs https://travis-ci.org/z-kit/z-input/builds/200455596 indicate an econnreset error in the selenium server. oddly, this only affects travis ci. tested on two computers locally and it's fine.
