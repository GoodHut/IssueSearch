 URL : "https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/2840" TITLE : double slash in swagger ui BODY : i think there is a regression: when i use swagger ui from the master, when i fetch json generated by annotations, i end up with paths having double slashes. ! screenshot from 2017-04-03 17 43 43 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1900121/24617744/261e1e7a-1895-11e7-8d06-e8e19478966e.png https://gist.github.com/mateuszkubuszok/e1d2eac07ecc2fab4b6b138992050e09 i assume that baseurl should be / rather than , as even if i set it to empty string it will be corrected to string ending with / . same with endpoints - even if i remove leading slash it will be restored, so i assume it should be there. ps. is there a reason why dist do not contain favicons nor oauth2-response.html ?
