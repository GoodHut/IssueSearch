 URL : "https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues/3205" TITLE : update docs for osx BODY : docker have made a lot of changes in docker for mac, and our documentation has not kept pace. first mention a user might find is in https://www.weave.works/docs/net/latest/install/installing-weave/, where it talks about docker machine, which is a couple of generations old. there is a link to https://www.weave.works/docs/tutorials/old-guides/docker-legacy/part-1/ which is old. the best doc currently is probably https://www.weave.works/blog/debugging-docker-mac-weave-net/, but that's over a year old too.
