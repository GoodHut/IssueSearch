 URL : "https://github.com/Gaufrette/extras/issues/4" TITLE : generic lazy adapter BODY : since lazyopencloud adapter has been deprecated, i think we should find a generic way of implementing lazy adapters. lazy adapters would be useful because currently any adapter, either it's used or not, need a valid connection at instantiation time and this might lead to connections opened but not used.
