 URL : "https://github.com/redhat-documentation/asciidoc-markup-conventions/issues/2" TITLE : unify & fix anchor ids BODY : @asteflova: looking at the table 1 , i noticed one thing. the mark-up for anchors is either anchor or anchor . i recommend adding id='anchor' . it's the only one that seems to work with attributes in appendices. to be more specific: an anchor like this in an appendix: {assembly}-section_header gives this error when building with ccutil: asciidoctor: error: master.adoc: line 67: invalid part, must have at least one section e.g., chapter, appendix, etc. but with an anchor like this: id='{assembly}-section_header' the book builds correctly. 1 https://redhat-documentation.github.io/asciidoc-markup-conventions/
