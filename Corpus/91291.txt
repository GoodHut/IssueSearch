 URL : "https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/issues/2281" TITLE : testing: timeout behavior BODY : when testing via meson test mytestcase on meson 0.42.0, i am seeing 2 issues: stdout does not appear to be included in build/meson-logs/testlog.txt if the test times out. if it passes or fails, it is included as expected, and stderr is included in both cases. i haven't found a convenient way to kill the test executable when running the meson test harness. ctrl-c kills the meson test parent process, but does not appear to kill the test binary.
