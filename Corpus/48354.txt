 URL : "https://github.com/viewflow/viewflow/issues/181" TITLE : role based permission BODY : sometimes there is a need to divide processes between cities, and then there is not enough object permission. for example, the call center operator receives calls from 36 cities, and it needs to distribute them between cities. naturally, managers from different cities should not see applications from other cities among their applications. how can this be realized?
