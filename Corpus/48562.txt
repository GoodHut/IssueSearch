 URL : "https://github.com/KSDaemon/sails-hook-sequelize/issues/41" TITLE : sequelize cli support BODY : i'm trying to use sequelize cli https://github.com/sequelize/cli with sails, and then i run sequelize db:drop - it gives me an error: > sequelize cli node: 8.7.0, cli: 3.0.0, orm: 4.13.6 > > warning: this version of sequelize cli is not fully compatible with sequelize v4. https://github.com/sequelize/cli sequelize-support > > loaded configuration file config/sequelize.js . > > error: dialect undefined does not support db:create / db:drop commands it happens because it doesn't understand that my database settings are defended in config/datastores.js and config/env/ .js files, under sails.config.connections || sails.config.datastores variables. sails itself does understand it, thanks to sails-hook-sequelize , but sequelize-cli doesn't. i can solve that problem with following hack: var path = require 'path' ; var config = require path.resolve 'config/env', process.env.node_env || 'development' ; module.exports = { url: config.datastores.default.url, dialect: config.datastores.default.dialect, }; however i believe, that it would be nice if sails-hook-sequelize supports sequelize-cli as well.
