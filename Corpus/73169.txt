BODY : hello there, i do not really understand what is this questions asking. i only understand that the question wants me to do an if else statement with the function return in it. however, i do not understand why there are two returns and there was no len to measure the length of a_string . i checked the solution but i still do not understand why can't i jsut do a simple if else statement to using len to determine the return.
