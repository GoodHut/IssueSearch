 URL : "https://github.com/MoMEMta/MoMEMta/issues/130" TITLE : typos in pool::put BODY : this function leaks if t 's constructor throws when a new std::shared_ptr<t> is created. the correct code should be auto ptr = std::make_shared<t> std::forward args ... ; furthermore, i think that the correct signature of this function should make use of forwarding references,i.e. template <typename t, typename... args> std::shared_ptr<t> pool::put const inputtag& tag, args&&... args ; observe the && added after args i would make a pull request, but have never collaborated in any project, so i don't even know how to do them!! how to properly test the program after having made the changes and so . if you could tell me how to collaborate i would not mind to check other parts of the code at all.
