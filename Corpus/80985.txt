 URL : "https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips/issues/809" TITLE : using regex in post_jump BODY : i have just shy of a hundred snippets that follow a very rigid pattern: post_jump snip.expand_anon get_dunder_method_snippet name='str' snippet def __str__ a generic dunder factory rb endsnippet post_jump snip.expand_anon get_dunder_method_snippet name='rmul' snippet def __rmul__ a generic dunder factory rb endsnippet the only part that varies in this case is the actual snippet definition, def __ .+ __ and in the area for post_jump, where name would ideally gets passed whatever was matched in the snippet definition. currently, i have every python dunder method defined like this and i'd love to just get it down to one regex-powered snippet to handle all of this. i'm sure the solution is simple but i just can't seem to figure it out. can you please point me in the right direction?
