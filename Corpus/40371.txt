this is to ensure that most players will die at least once and see that they can rewind.
- draw special attention to the purple past merky that is the most recent, hopefully the player will see it and click it.

- remove boulder rolling section boulder rolling is for the force wave level - add zoom out trigger to plinko maze so players can see they can manually activate the time rewind
