 URL : "https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/issues/1297" TITLE : federatedstore save graphs BODY : a federatedstore restart or re-initialisation would cause the federatedstore to loose all graphs added since the previous re-start/initialisation by users. this would require all graphs to be re-added all over again by users. federatedstore should be able to save all the graphs in scope and their auths. this could also provide an audit. ‚ùìthoughts required around using a cache to be storing internal details in the situation of crash, everything is automatically saved at all times.
