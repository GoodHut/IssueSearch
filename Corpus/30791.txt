 URL : "https://github.com/pseudonym117/Riot-Watcher/issues/82" TITLE : rate limiter issues BODY : i spawned 13 threads each with a single request and ran them all at once and hit a cant set attribute error. the problem is with the line below: limits.py ~~ rawlimit = namedtuple 'rawlimit', 'count', 'limit', 'time' namedtuples are not mutable, so line 100 of limits.py: raw_limit.counts = self._raw_limit.counts will not work. theres a mutable list implementation called namedlist which does the job, but has a default attribute called 'count' so just rename that to whatever. i'm testing this with a production key so im definitely not hitting any limit, but this gets logged: 'overwriting time limit, previously %s, now %s. ' + 'this may cause rate limitting issues.' can you elaborate how the limiter works and any edge cases you may be aware of, especially with these comments in the code: double check that we arent assigning a lower, non-1 value to our count. this may be screwy if a bunch of requests are sent as the rate limit is getting reset, but i dont think there is a more elegant solution.
