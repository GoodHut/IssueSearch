 URL : "https://github.com/ingve/ql-thumbnail/issues/2" TITLE : hang on emlx files BODY : i'm working on a directory catalogue application, and have thus far been using qlmanage to produce thumbs. as far as i can tell, qlmanage doesn't support defining image output type from the command line, and i need jpegs, not pngs. i could pipe the png to imagemagick but i'd rather not do that for performance reasons. i was happy to find this wrapper and have been using it quite a bit. i am sending lots of files of all types, and it works as expected. today i encountered an issue with .emlx files. these seem to be the only files that create this issue. qlmanage can generate a thumbnail instantly without issue, but ql-thumbnail hangs for a few seconds, then fails to create the thumbnail file. for example, qlmanage -t -f 4 -o . 22221.emlx produces a png, 22221.emlx.png, 512 pixels with the appropriate preview image the same operation with ql-thumbnail fails without any output ql-thumbnail 22221.emlx . public.png 512 512 i've tried public.png and public.jpeg without success. any help is much appreciated!
