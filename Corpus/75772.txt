BODY : right now i'm about to start changing the code structure a bit in order to match the psr loader so basically file names and namespaces . althoug i'm a bit afraid to not break stuff, i'm confident enough that will work. however, i was thinking: since the plugin grows nicely, how about we adding some automated tests? either unit tests, by mocking all wp like described here: https://carlalexander.ca/introduction-wordpress-unit-testing/ or functional tests, by using the wp lib, like described here: https://pippinsplugins.com/unit-tests-wordpress-plugins-setting-up-testing-suite/ i'm still new at this game and learning by doing, but i think it's a good thing to have some kind of automated testing for big ish features. so, what do you guys think? we should start doing this? ðŸ––
