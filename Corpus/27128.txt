 URL : "https://github.com/trvswgnr/codecademy-brackets-theme/issues/1" TITLE : conflict with emmet BODY : absolutely love the theme. but it seems to be causing conflict with other plugins on linux, especially emmet i think . with this theme as default, every time brackets is loaded one or the other extension does not work. have to reload with/without extensions several times to get things to come back. if i change the theme the extensions seem to load.
