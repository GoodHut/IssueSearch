 URL : "https://github.com/silne30/t-issues_chrome_extension/issues/5" TITLE : standard test case format BODY : overview this format to standardize test cases to use in the t-issues extension. it's an extension of the writing test cases for qa document https://githubber.com/article/crafts/engineering/qa/writing-qa-tests-in-github-flavoured-markdown . the original doc includes names and steps. example: - profiles - user profile http://github.com/ user name - change profile picture http://github.com/settings/profile - with drag and drop - drag in an image - tweak crop box and save - confirm that the profile picture changes - with the file selector dialog tweaks since test cases are just parsed from markdown, it would make sense to group the test cases by feature using typical markdown hierarchy. in the above listed example, the feature would be profiles . for the sake of clarity and readability, it would likely make a bit more sense to use headers for the features. profiles user profile - change profile picture - with drag and drop - drag in an image - tweak crop box and save - confirm that the profile picture changes - with the file selector dialog this tweak allows for the parser to have a starting point for generating the test plan whilst also allowing the test plan writer to have first and second level headers for documentation organization.
