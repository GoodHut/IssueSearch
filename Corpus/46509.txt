 URL : "https://github.com/mikeal/watch/issues/123" TITLE : mention windows usage BODY : in the cli part please specify/include some general examples for all platforms! because windows users may need to use double quotes rather than single quotes and if used in an npm script they need to escape the double quotes like this: scripts : { watch:osx : watch 'clear && npm run test -s' source watch:windows : watch \ clear && npm run test -s\ source , } it's really hard to find some proper documentation and it took me quites some time to figure out all this stuff, would be nice to include it here, you would save people alot of time!
