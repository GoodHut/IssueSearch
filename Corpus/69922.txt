 URL : "https://github.com/rakhimov/scram/issues/176" TITLE : units for failure rate? BODY : for the exponential distribution, parameter lambda has units of failures/unit time . however, how does one specify the time units? two main questions here: - in the configuration xml file, one can specify the mission time: <mission-time>8760</mission-time> however, what are the units? - in the input fault tree xml file, one can specify apprenty the unit for system-mission-time , but: - what is the system-mission-time tag for and why is it required for all the basic event probability distribution models? e.g. <exponential> <float value= 1e-4 /> <system-mission-time unit= hours /> </exponential> - if i understand correctly and it is up to the user to be consistent with units i.e. specify numerical values according to a consistent set of units, scram doesn't care about what units time is , then why does system-mission-time have the unit parameter? since mission-time in the configuration xml file does not... i could not find an answer to this in the open-psa documation, except that they never use the unit attribute of system-mission-time nor do they explain what it is for .
