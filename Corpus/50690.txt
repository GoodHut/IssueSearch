 URL : "https://github.com/forio/contour/issues/246" TITLE : ability for zero-plane BODY : currently when a graph contains negative numbers, the axis stays fixed to the origin. for example given var data = 10, -28, 21, 5, 18, 5, 13, 21, 25, 17, 26 ; the x & y axes meet at the start of each. there are times when we would want to have the y-axis be at the 0 point.
