 URL : "https://github.com/TryKickoff/statix/issues/8" TITLE : statix 'next' version BODY : just a general question, how do we organize versions for releases? current code and setup in 'next' branch will be v4 or v5? looking at v4 https://github.com/trykickoff/statix/issues/5 todo list, looks like most of it no longer relevant as we started to use gulp setup from latest kickoff version. i guess we need to set up a new 'update plan' for the next release of statix
