 URL : "https://github.com/etherkit/Si5351Arduino/issues/52" TITLE : output enable behavior BODY : in using the output enable function in the library i noticed that the si5351 output would be re-enabled by a subsequent.si5351_set_freq call after being disabled with si5351.output_enable si5351_clk0,0 . per pm this behavior is intentional, assuming that users would want the output turned on automatically when issuing set_freq commands. i understand the reason for this but it took some trial and error to determine that output.enable does not control the output the way i thought it would. so per pm i'm listing it here for future considereration, even though we agree there is merit in both approaches. bob
