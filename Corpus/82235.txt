 URL : "https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/issues/16180" TITLE : add note field to article BODY : articles lack note field. they only have version note, which does not function the same way. any reason this has not been added yet ? for my specific use-case, i export articles, menus etc to xliff format, and would like to have a note field that i can export as instructions to the translator xliff support the <note> tag . the fact that this field is present for menus and modules mod_custom makes no sense to me.
