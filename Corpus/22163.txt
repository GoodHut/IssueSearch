 URL : "https://github.com/Agile-IoT/agile-sdk/issues/12" TITLE : inclusion with npm BODY : hi @craig-mulligan i tried to include this project with npm by executing this. npm install --save git+https://github.com/agile-iot/agile-sdk.git afterwards, i created an index.js file that imports the dist file like this because i thought the issue was that npm was not recognizing the entry point or something... module.exports = require './dist/index.js' ; now, the require 'agile-sdk; inside the project including agile-sdk didn't fail, but once i actually try to instantiate the api, i get an error saying that ./dist/index.js is not there inside the agile-sdk . so, i was checking... _and even when i have installed agile-sdk, there is no src folder inside the module_ located in node_modules. maybe the package json needs to be updated so people can use it with npm transparently? as a workaround, i checkout agile-sdk, execute npm install inside and then use npm link.
