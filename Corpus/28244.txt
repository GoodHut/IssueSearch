 URL : "https://github.com/openai/cleverhans/issues/150" TITLE : fix generate_np bug BODY : when generate_np is called more than once with different arguments, it just replays the first graph. i think it would be best to fix this by just removing generate_np, because some keyword arguments need to trigger generation of new graphs and others don't. this seems like too subtle of a point for most attack implementers to handle.
