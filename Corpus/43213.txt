 URL : "https://github.com/rudaoshi/gpumatrix/issues/3" TITLE : compile without boost BODY : i just run into another compile issue: the library requires boost to compile. i checked the code. there is only one place where boost is used: in maparray.h, boost_static_assert is used to check the condition d == 1. i tried to replace it with static_assert, it then compiles. my suggestion is to remove header include <boost/static_assert.hpp> and replace boost_static_assert with static_assert to avoid unnecessary dependency.
