BODY : hi, thank you very much for posting your code. i've spent time reading it and learnt a lot. i have this question: https://github.com/colinmorris/instacart-basket-prediction/blob/4d62ff6c1304639751c305000cf647a85a2d4dac/vectorize.py l73 this sets the mask based on the maximum cart_index which i couldn't understand. that is not the literal meaning of first_occurences, is it? i thought the mask is to filter out ineligible products that are not ordered yet. if so, shouldn't it be: first_occurences = prev_ordered>0 .argmax axis=1 thank you very much.
