 URL : "https://github.com/typora/typora-issues/issues/835" TITLE : jumping all around on save BODY : something is still wrong with 0.9.9.10.3... when i'm in source mode and make a change and save, the window will jump to the bottom of the file and sometimes to the top of the file. also inexplicably it inserts characters that i don't want. in particular, i often - without difficulty until now - insert display math in a blockquote. i learned in typora to do this: >blah > >$$ e=mc^2 $$ > notice the careful placement of the > . now i'm finding that if i do this and even if i save the file immediately, when i go to the rendered version the equation will be wrongly formatted and when i go back to the source it will have transformed to: >blah > >$$ >e=mc^2 $$ >
