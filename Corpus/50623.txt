 URL : "https://github.com/cloudendpoints/endpoints-python/issues/127" TITLE : 3rd party auth - auth0 BODY : hello, i'm trying to use auth0 for authentication and following the documentation https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/frameworks/java/authenticating-users authenticating_with_auth0 , this simply doesn't work. i'm getting this error: id_token verification failed: invalid token signature debugging this thing, seems like the code are checking the url https://www.googleapis.com/service_accounts/v1/metadata/raw/federated-signon@system.gserviceaccount.com and not the auth0 jkws url. for reference, i'm not using local dev environment. thanks in advance
