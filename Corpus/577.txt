 URL : "https://github.com/tastejs/hacker-news-pwas/issues/20" TITLE : set up ci BODY : now that the site is deployed on app engine https://hnpwa-prod.appspot.com/ , we probably want to set up a ci. travis ci has some neat documentation https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/google-app-engine with app engine. moreover, here's a gem i used to generate all the app.yaml handlers with jekyll. can probably make things a lot simpler so i think it makes sense to attach it to this ticket.
