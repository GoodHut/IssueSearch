BODY : disposables are the aspect of c that i have the most trouble with, and an extension like this would be very helpful. unfortunately, i've switched to vs 2017, and this _only_ supports 2015. i don't know how drastically the apis have changed between the two, but unless it would require completely rewriting the code, it would be nice to extend support to the newer version -- and if it _is_ that different, a note in the readme saying that support isn't planned probably wouldn't go awry.
