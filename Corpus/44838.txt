 URL : "https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues/850" TITLE : force offline caching BODY : it would be nice if there was some way to force neomutt to always maintain a cache of all, or specific, imap folders. currently neomutt won't download all imap messages into its offline cache unless you give it a need to directly access them. at present the only workaround that i am aware of is to search a folder using the message body query with a search key that doesn't match anything e.g. ~b 123foo so that it caches everything.
