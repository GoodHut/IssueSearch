 URL : "https://github.com/Eelviny/nxt-python/issues/105" TITLE : programming from python BODY : hello, i would like to import on the nxt robot a python programm which would enable the nxt robot to take the shortest path to go from a point a to a point b in a room. so actually, i made a programm which gives me the path in a list. now, i guess i need to create another programm thanks to the fonctions i found in the nxt folder, isn't it? as a consequence i thought this: i could just use lego mindstorms education nxt programming and the robot would react as if i had used python-nxt... can you help me please? thank you.
