 URL : "https://github.com/openmicroscopy/design/issues/79" TITLE : iviewer multiple viewers BODY : current prototype is @waxenegger's https://github.com/waxenegger/omero-iviewer/tree/mdi main concerns: - buttons on the viewer canvas seem to take up a more significant portion of space when viewers are smaller. need to hide these by default in multi-view mode. show them with click on 'settings' button? - hiding other controls in the frame e.g. z/t controls & labels is probably not worth it, since we don't save much space and it's confusing to users for some controls to disappear. possible exception is the time-stamp label which could be hidden in multi-view mode. - when in multiviewer mode, single clicks on thumbnails current open a new viewer. not possible to browse through the thumbnails with a single click on each as you can in single viewer mode. i think that we should probably not have 2 modes, but multiple viewers can always be opened by double-clicking on thumbnails. various text editors sublime & visual studio code at least operate something like this with multiple tabs. more details to follow... - synchronisation of viewers - this needs to be bi-directional and is probably simplest to manage it via groups like icy, since using image names won't work duplicate viewers of same image . however, each group could be configured to sync z/t and/or view zoom, pan, rotation and/or channels. current screenshot.... <img width= 1375 alt= screen shot 2017-10-04 at 14 59 38 src= https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/900055/31179752-ba517f0a-a914-11e7-98fd-fd46388f501e.png > cc @jburel
