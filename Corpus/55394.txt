 URL : "https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/issues/14824" TITLE : intro box auto-dismiss BODY : currently, new users see the intro box at the top of reader. it includes a link to dismiss the box. if the user does not dismiss the box themselves, we should dismiss it for them after some period of time. i suggest two weeks after their signup date. or, if it's possible, two weeks after the first time they saw it. but if that's too complicated, we can just do two weeks past account creation. why? anything we put at the top of the stream causes engagement rates to go down. we should give the box a chance to do its thing, but if the user is ignoring it, we should remove it so that the posts have a better shot at wooing the user into engaging. cc @bluefuton
