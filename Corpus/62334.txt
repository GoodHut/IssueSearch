 URL : "https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/issues/1" TITLE : clarification of credit BODY : working my way through the document thanks! . it would be great to clarify the meaning of credit in the context of cosmos hub and token transfers. discussed this briefly with @adrianbrink and there seems to be a difference between source zone issuer of the token - perhaps issuer zone is a better term and other zones which can receive the token but never send back more then they received. might be explained better later in document, but would be helpful to clarify early on.
