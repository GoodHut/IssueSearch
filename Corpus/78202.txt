 URL : "https://github.com/Jongchan/tensorflow-vdsr/issues/19" TITLE : plot unexpected behavior BODY : if you run test on two different test datasets using two different checkpoints say, you run dataset 1 on checkpoints after 15 and 20 epochs and run dataset 2 on checkpoints after 0 and 30 epochs , then plot will correctly only append the relevant checkpoint results to each dataset. however, this leads to the behavior of the number which is played not matching up with the correct checkpoint. e.g. np.argmax vdsr_mean_2 would probably give 1, 1, 1 as the max for both dataset 1 and dataset 2 but it should give 1, 1, 1 and then 3, 3, 3 . any simple fixes?
