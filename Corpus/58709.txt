 URL : "https://github.com/Danielv123/factorioClusterio/issues/42" TITLE : stdio mode for linuxes BODY : the factorio server does not attach properly to stdio on windows. it does fortunately do this on linuxes, so we could use an os check and accept the proper interface if it works. should also look into windows 10 bash on ubuntu on windows wsl as it seems to be able to run and pipe from the factorio server properly. this could possibly be the best way to run clusterio on windows, but rcon should still be left in as a backup. std might solve 34 size issues 38 is also most likely an rcon related problem which would kindof be mitigated with this.
