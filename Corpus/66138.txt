 URL : "https://github.com/ocaml-doc/odoc/issues/61" TITLE : manuals written in odoc BODY : @trefis mentioned the new .mld syntax that allows to create a home page for a package, similarly to -index for ocamldoc. i would really like the ability to link together multiple .mld documents, with one generated web page per file and the ability to make links. this would effectively allow to write complete multi-page manuals in odoc.
