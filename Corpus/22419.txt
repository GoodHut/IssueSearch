 URL : "https://github.com/kode54/dumb/issues/51" TITLE : large file support BODY : i know that 2gb-mod-files are very unlikely to occur, but i am wondering whether it makes sense to support files >2gb. i propose the following define -d_file_offset_bits=64 during build so ftell returns a 64-bit-type on unix-platforms do the right thing on windows i think that would be defining ftell to a 64-bit equivalent change the interface of dumbfile_system to take dumb_off_t which resolves to a 64-bit-type can be checked at compile-time what do others think?
