 URL : "https://github.com/tgingold/ghdl/issues/390" TITLE : register simulation error BODY : testbench constant clk1_period : time:= 3.2 ns; clk1_process :process begin clk1 <= '1'; wait for clk1_period/2; clk1 <= '0'; wait for clk1_period/2; end process; write_proc :process begin wait for clk1_period 6 write_start <= '1'; wait for clk1_period 1; write_start <= '0'; end process; source code : process clk1 begin if clk1'event and clk1 = '1' then r0_write_start <= write_start; end if; end process; if you do this in a testbench compiled with ghdl then r0_write_start and write_start are in the same clock cycle, without any register between them, but if you add some delay to the wait for statement, like doing this wait for clk1_period 6.001 then they are at different clock cycle. i guess the problem is in the wait for statement, maybe it dont make syncronus the signal
