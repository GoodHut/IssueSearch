 URL : "https://github.com/Alexia/DynamicPageList/issues/34" TITLE : updaterules causes error BODY : when using updaterules i get several warnings one for each mw group : errorexception from line 4556 of includes/user/user.php: php warning: illegal offset type in isset or empty the result page shows: permission error you do not have permission to <action-array>, for the following reason: you are not allowed to execute the action you have requested. work around solution? was to remove the array brackets on line 781 and 785 in parametersdata.php. a non-sysop user now gets as expected : permission error you do not have permission to to use the parameter 'updaterules', for the following reason: the action you have requested is limited to users in the group: administrators. a sysop user works, however i am getting 'session error' and there seems to be a problem with your login session; this action has been canceled as a precaution against session hijacking. go back to the previous page, reload that page and then try again. for each selected page to be updated. using mw 1.27.1 and dynamicpagelist3 3.0.9
