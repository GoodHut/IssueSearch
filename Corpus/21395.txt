 URL : "https://github.com/LightsHope/server/issues/523" TITLE : fear on a boat bug BODY : normally, casting a fear type spell on a player causes them to run around in random directions at normal speed for the spell's duration. however, when used on a player that is on a boat, they move at seemingly 500% normal speed or thereabouts and will also move off the boat and into the water. this can result in the feared player being sent hundreds of yards away from the boat, out into the ocean, in mere seconds. i observed multiple horde players exploiting this bug while pvping on the boat. reporting it to gms multiple times got no appreciable replies, saying that they do not intervene with such issues.
