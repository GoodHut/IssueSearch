 URL : "https://github.com/BestMood-Tech/Hirefy-client/issues/18" TITLE : colors in the table BODY : answers in the results page are not being colour-coded where positive and negative scores have been applied. is it possible to get this done so that we're able to see it at a glance when reviewing results. this could be as simple as green for a positive score, red for a negative, and nothing for no score applied. what would be even better if possible is lighter and darker shades of red and green being applied for the score depending on how heavy it is.
