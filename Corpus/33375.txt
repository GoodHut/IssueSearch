 URL : "https://github.com/EvokeNet/humhub/issues/462" TITLE : add maintenance page BODY : ability to put up a maintenance page that let's players know the site is being worked on use case - we have a known issue on site that we are working on addressing and we don't want users to repeatedly experience the same error - allows us more time to address the issue - so if for example we have an issue on friday and cannot address until a monday.
