 URL : "https://github.com/ArduCAM/Arduino/issues/172" TITLE : ov5642 corrupt jpeg BODY : hello, i am using an arduino mega 2560 with an ov5642 mini rev b. i have uploaded the mini_video_streaming example to the arduino and when i open the host app, the camera is detected and spi is ok. i select single photo and 320x240 picture, but when i click capture i get about 7800 bytes of data, but only saves a file 1/5th of the time. when it does save the file, it is a corrupt jpeg. i did have to change one thing in the code. i changed serial.begin 921600 to serial.begin 115200 . if i don't i don't get anything displayed in the host app besides com open. i am using an arduino mega with a ch340g as the usb to serial converter because it is a cheap clone. does that have anything to do with the need to change the baud rate, or am i missing something else as well? thank you for the help!!
