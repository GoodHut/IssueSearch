 URL : "https://github.com/akvo/akvo-flow-mobile/issues/954" TITLE : reload all forms BODY : background currently the reload all forms starts a service which attempts to find new or outdated forms on the server and if any downloads them. if there are forms to download, a notification is displayed although in the future the updated or new forms will be displayed in bold in the list. if the download fails we display a notification error but if there are 2 cases which are not covered and where we do not notify the user: user is not connected to wifi and he did not allow mobile data usage user is not connected to the internet there are no new forms to download in all these cases, the user is not notified at all and may think the feature is broken. suggestion display a toast informing the user in these 3 cases
