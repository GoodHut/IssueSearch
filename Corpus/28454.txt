 URL : "https://github.com/greenbone/gsa/issues/20" TITLE : get rid of autobind BODY : in the early beginnings of i have implemented a autobind function to bind handler functions for react component automatically based on their name prefix. this violates the explicit is better the implicit rule and therefore autobind isn't used very much if at all now . therefore autobind should be removed completely from the ng code. it lives in gmp/utils.js at the moment.
