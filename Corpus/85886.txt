 URL : "https://github.com/McJty/MeeCreeps/issues/27" TITLE : ftb utilities fake player BODY : my issue is the fact that if i have a claim chunk meecreeps sits idle and does not do anything, unless i remove the claimed chunk. is it possible to add fake player or what not so meecreeps is usable while in my claimed chunk? or am i missing something completely here? i'm playing all the mods 3 in a mp server. thank you
