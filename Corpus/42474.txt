 URL : "https://github.com/octref/vetur/issues/130" TITLE : better css experience BODY : not sure if it is possible but here are a few suggestions for improvning the css experience: 1. intellisense for css classes and ids based on whats in the template. 2. the reverse for above, when adding a class to an html element, list the classes defined in the style section. 3. maybe some handling for external css, or not? 4. also, when using colors in css vs code usually has a little colorbox thats super helpful, but i don't see that in the style section, is it possible to add this? a bit rough perhaps, will be happy to elaborate on any of it!
