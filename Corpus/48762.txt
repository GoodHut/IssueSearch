 URL : "https://github.com/fac-12/nasa-daily/issues/29" TITLE : slightly confusing ui BODY : i found the app a bit unintuitive when i visited for the first time. when i select a date, my immediate expectation is that it's a picture from that date, so i'm momentarily confused by a historical fact and image. maybe some explanatory subtitle would be helpful. i also found the today button unintuitive, as i expect it to set the date to today, but it just pulls up today without resetting the date field. as an idea, since the pictures seem to be totally random, maybe you add a random button that selects a random date for me, as that is essentially what i am doing by selecting a date in the first place - getting a random picture and fact.
