 URL : "https://github.com/tomwalder/php-gds/issues/151" TITLE : development server error BODY : hi tom, i haven't touched any of my gae projects for quite a while, and recently updated the sdk and development environment for gae, and ever since can't use the development server. i keep getting a fatal error: uncaught exception 'google\appengine\runtime\applicationerror' with message 'illegal string &quot;dev~none&quot; in dataset id. after updating gcloud i was forced to remove the application id and version from my .yaml and wonder if this is causing issues with the development environment? i recall you assisted me in setting the applicationid using the $_server array for unit testing, but this doesn't seem to bring any joy for this issue. do you have any advice on how to resolve this? my current alternative is to continually deploy to gae, which makes development incredibly slow... any help would be great. cheers, matt
