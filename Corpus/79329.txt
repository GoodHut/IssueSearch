 URL : "https://github.com/dequis/purple-facebook/issues/374" TITLE : sent a message to myself BODY : dunno whether that was a bug nor how likely it's to happen again, but here's what happened. i was chatting with my bro yesterday or a day before via fb purple . it was a 1:1 conversation. and one of the messages i sent to him came to me as a new conversation, i.e. a new pidgin tab opened, there was a message i sent and the sender was my own fb account. i kind of had a chat with myself : however anything i wrote in that new chat was not echoed back. not sure whether this happened due to fb's fault or there was something overlooked in purple's code. i just felt i should report it.
