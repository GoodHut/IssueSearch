 URL : "https://github.com/tkindy/Courses/issues/2" TITLE : add degree audit parser BODY : this is the most critical feature i want to implement. students can get course requisite information from a few other sites; northeastern degree audit parsing isn't implemented anywhere to my knowledge. it'd be pretty cool to be able to submit your degree audit and get detailed information on the prerequisites you need/have completed for your degree. the audit's poorly formatted, a mess of html4 tags with almost no hierarchy. that being said, i'll try to keep it as dynamic as possible.
