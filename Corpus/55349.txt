 URL : "https://github.com/HardeepAsrani/hestia-pricing-extension/issues/2" TITLE : installation / license BODY : hello, thank you for this - i'm trying to install, but i'm not sure exactly where to place this. i followed the hestia tutorial and they recommend placing in a child theme under inc/sections/hestia-pricing-section.php , not sure if that's the intended location but i'm not seeing the extra pricing table show up yet. thanks! also a license file would be fantastic.
