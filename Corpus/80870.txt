 URL : "https://github.com/thangngoc89/react-howler/issues/39" TITLE : use fixed howler version BODY : after a quick look via commit history of howler.js. i can say that they don't follow semver. so i suggest we use a fixed version of howler to avoid weird bug like 37 . what do you think @stenerson ?
