BODY : hi, with this code: var express = require 'express' ; var router = express.router ; var reactcookie = require 'react-cookie' ; router.get '/', function req, res { reactcookie.plugtorequest req, res ; var cookie = reactcookie.load somecookie ; } ; if two people request this route at the same time, the cookie value will be the same for both users! and in a rather obvious way! because you store the rawcookies globally in your script, instead of using a different rawcookies for each request, the first request will write rawcookies , and the second one will overwrite it... and return the second cookie to the first user
