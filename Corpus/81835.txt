 URL : "https://github.com/kdotsee/teacozy/issues/4" TITLE : a few design suggestions. BODY : there were a few things that i thought would be a good idea to take a look at and try to improve. the first thing was to make the header section take up the full width of the screen. if you scroll down the page, the left side of the header is slightly moved to the right. instead, you might want to make it completely cover the left and right edges. the second thing was to change the 'our mission' section so that the padding or margin was reduced and the text was slightly more vertically aligned. this can improve the design of the page. finally, each location in the 'locations' section appears to have the same information. try to change this so that it matches the project specification.
