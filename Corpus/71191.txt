 URL : "https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/CRUD/issues/899" TITLE : action buttons sortable? BODY : hi, its not an issue but something i think is lacking here.. i have 6 buttons in my action column and the only option available is the 'beginning' and 'end' in order for the placement of the buttons.. how can i make sure the sequence of those buttons? like i want 1. view profile btn 2. edit profile btn 3. send a text 4. send an email 5. notes 6. delete user if the buttons are added throughout the projects' lifetime.. they wont be in order like the above example. so what if instead of having beginning and end options, we can have sortable option like some of the other platforms cms have? i hope im making some sense here ðŸ˜„ or may be i am the only one with such scenario? any comments/suggestions are welcome : thanks.
