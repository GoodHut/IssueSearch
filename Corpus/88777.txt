 URL : "https://github.com/alecthomas/kingpin/issues/214" TITLE : optionally required flags BODY : i may be missing it in the docs but is it possible to have a flag be required only if another flag was not passed? for example, i want to support loading a user defined config file or pass details in on the command line, so if the user passes --config they don't need to supply --host or other flags.
