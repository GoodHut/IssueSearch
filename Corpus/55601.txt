 URL : "https://github.com/TrueBitFoundation/webasm-solidity/issues/20" TITLE : json error with app.js BODY : was running through the readme and was able to run deploy-tasks.js with parity chain dev to create the config.json. but when i try to run app.js it gives a json error. this is because deploy-tasks.js is outputting two json objects, instead of one, like app.js expects. { interactive : 0x4d06047ed426e2a2f0bbe86cee268200d20b8d62 , tasks : 0xcfa55b9b5c1c05e81a7f306a841ae6f3b489d057 } { interactive : 0x7a0d30234e146a88cd65f0714ab7603b0568b16a , tasks : 0x6ec4905ff2bfbb1ee8f4c11006ef528df4d30b80 } i can go in the file and delete the second object and then the app works.
