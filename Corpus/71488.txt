 URL : "https://github.com/javaslang/javaslang/issues/1932" TITLE : add more collect methods BODY : with 1099 we got traversable.collect partialfunction . now we will add more collect methods to other value implementations. we are able to do it for 'univalent' values like option, future, try, ... because we are able to return an empty instance. it is not possible for 'bivalent' values like either, validation, ... because there is no constructor for the empty type which is generic .
