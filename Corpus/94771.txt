 URL : "https://github.com/pixelart/ansible-role-phpstorm/issues/14" TITLE : clean up old installations BODY : | q | a | --- | --- | bug? | no | new feature? | yes actual behavior currently every new version creates a new installation folder and the old one is still there. wastes spaces over time. expected behavior clean up old installation. maybe with an keep_releases count, so you don't delete the version before, which may be opened.
