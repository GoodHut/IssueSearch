 URL : "https://github.com/magento-engcom/import-export-improvements/issues/3" TITLE : importing empty attributes BODY : when you have products with a lot of attributes the column 'additional_attributes' can be huge. it would be better to create new column for each attribute and not combine them in one column. just like all other attributes. the problem when splitting by character is that you always have to check if your client will not be using that character.
