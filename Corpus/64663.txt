 URL : "https://github.com/Pictela/gulp-token-replace/issues/14" TITLE : have spaces into tokens BODY : hi pictela, first of all, thank for this plugin. it's simplistic and a real pleasure to use it. in my work case, i would like something like that : <link href= {{ destination.serverrelativeurl }}/folder/styles/css/app.css rel= stylesheet > have spaces after and before the prefix and suffix delimiters would be a bit more convenient to read. ps: i come here because i searched for several minutes where was my error with spaces because i didn't thinking it was not possible. i stay open if you want discuss about it.
