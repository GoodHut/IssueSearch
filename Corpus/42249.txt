 URL : "https://github.com/krakjoe/apcu/issues/264" TITLE : apcu from a cron job? BODY : i realize apc.enable_cli just makes apcu work from the cli. it doesn't give you access to the data used by your web server. i have a bunch of usage data i'm tracking with apcu from my rest api calls per minute, and similar metrics . i want to occasionally dump this data to the database on a schedule. i.e. the perfect candidate for a cron job. is there any sensible way to do this that i'm missing? is the only solution to run a localhost-only web server, and to make a call to a php script with something like curl?
