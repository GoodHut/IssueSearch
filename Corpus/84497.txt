 URL : "https://github.com/christoph-lucas/bifrost/issues/63" TITLE : datagram channel redesign BODY : address handling in the datagram layer. here's the channel handling i have in mind: - unidirectional datagram channels as there is no session, there is no reason to expect datagrams to be related - during creation of a sending channel, the receiver address and port are set - to send to different addresses, higher protocol layers create new datagram channel instances
