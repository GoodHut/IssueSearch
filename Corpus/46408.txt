 URL : "https://github.com/CS160-coolFolks/flask/issues/3" TITLE : make timeline dyanmic BODY : timeline is static in the way it is currently displayed by hour , and works poorly when the time frame indicated is small. possible solutions: - have zoom in/out interface - mathematically update timeline with a given set of points - maybe have the number of points desired changeable too?
