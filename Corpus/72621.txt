 URL : "https://github.com/openfl/lime/issues/958" TITLE : can't run lime on cloud9 BODY : hi, i got haxeflixel working on cloud9 last year, and documented the few caveats here https://ashes999.github.io/learnhaxe/haxeflixel-in-cloud9.html . i tried the same process today. haxeflixel installs with lime 2.9.1 by default. running haxelib run lime prints error: library lime version 2.9.1 does not have a run script . that's strange. so i installed lime separately with haxelib install lime and ended up with version 4.0.3. running haxelib run lime prints the same error. i assume this error is not a true indication of lime being broken, but something else in cloud9 muddling things. how can i get to the bottom of this error?
