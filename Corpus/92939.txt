 URL : "https://github.com/Vexal/WindowTetris/issues/1" TITLE : adapt to screen resolution BODY : hi, on my 4k screen, only the far top left screen edge is in use when playing this. as i see, you're very actively developing this game and thus, you should fix that. please help. also, there is no screen that says you lost, but you are punished for losing by the fact that exiting the game is quite hard. you need to kill it's main task. additionally, the code says purple red green and blue , but all tiles are actually white. thanks
