 URL : "https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/issues/2223" TITLE : reorganize the readme BODY : the readme is quite long and covers a wide variety of topics, making it quite intimidating for new users and hard to use even for experienced ones. it should be split up into separate markdown files that link together so it's easier to read as a readme. probably everything after the installation instructions can be moved into separate files, either by major section or topic.
