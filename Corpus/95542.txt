 URL : "https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/issues/1270" TITLE : decouple handlers from hub BODY : i was trying to write 1263 hubdispatcher , not on top of hub, but one of the tight coupling here is the request handler has a hub property and make a few uses of it. self.hub.base_url , self.hub.base_url , self.hub.cookie_name , self._set_user_cookie user, self.hub.server . as authenticator do inherit their handler from basehandler , then they are coupled to the existence of a hub thing. if we could transform the need for a hub to separate parameters that would make reusing handler in another context – like when you do not have a hub –  easier.
