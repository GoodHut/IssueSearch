BODY : issue description from this post https://pijul.org/2017/12/12/buildrustcrate/ i read that there is a thing called buildrustcrate in nixpkgs now. the post links this file https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/build-support/rust/build-rust-crate.nix as a resource. but i am not much more knowledgeable after reading it. how to use buildrustcrate ? there's documentation missing at least i did not find any on nixos.org . and, to include this somewhere: is this build on carnix ? because i just used carnix to create a build.nix file for my rust project and it errors with nix daemon out of memory after several seconds evaluating on a 16gb ram machine . technical details - system: x86_64-linux - host os: linux 4.14.2, nixos, 18.03pre122666.afe9649210c impala - multi-user?: yes - sandbox: yes - version: nix-env nix 1.11.16 - channels root : nixos-18.03pre122666.afe9649210c - channels m : - nixpkgs: /nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/root/channels/nixos/nixpkgs
