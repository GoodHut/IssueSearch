 URL : "https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/issues/990" TITLE : dynamic object support BODY : so i see that others jsut say to do a stringify on it but that kind of urks me a bit. to me it makes absolute sense that graphql should support dynamic objects in some way. personally i would like to see more of a marriage between graphql and flow in the way things are defined and work... it's possible they could even combine their overall syntax in many ways problem beign graphql meant to support multiple languages of course . in my case i have quite a few objects that define things dynamically with id's as the keys and a boolean as the value or something similar. perhaps some kind of maptype to support dynamic values ? these could still validate the general types, but the keys themselves would not be known. js { id-one : true, id-two : false } // or could really be considered as a js map id-one , true , id-two , false in this case, we can validate the key in the map is of string type and that the value is of boolean type. it's really a pain to deal with dynamic objects atm and i can see many others have struggled with this. any other ways of handling this i am missing?
