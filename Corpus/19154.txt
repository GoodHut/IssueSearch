 URL : "https://github.com/SChAth/ScAthiop/issues/333" TITLE : xml:id in witness BODY : it seems that there are several work records which have assigned a xml:id to the witnesses, as for example in lit2317senodo: xml <witness corresp= blorient481 ms_i3 xml:id= blorient481 /> i think that this might lead to errors on the app. if i see it correctly, the only place in which this xml:id has been used in the concerned records is to specify <bibl> - would it be possible here to use @corresp with the respective ms id? @eu-genia @massimovilla @pietroliuzzo
