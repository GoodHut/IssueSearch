 URL : "https://github.com/ifactorylab/rtmp-wrapper/issues/10" TITLE : memory leak problem BODY : i use this wrapper to download the packets from my rtmp server, though it is out of its original purpose this wrapper is to send/write data to rtmp servers . anyway, there is some memory leak in rtmp_clientpacket, rtmp_read. after i change rtmp.c with that in the 'rtmpdump', everythings are fixed. i think rtmp.c in rtmp-wrapper is not the same with rtmp.c in rtmpdump .
