 URL : "https://github.com/audiojs/contributing/issues/35" TITLE : repo style questions BODY : i have some questions for the style of the repos we could establish further here to clean up any inconsistencies - should we push yarn.lock https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/yarn-lock/ or should it be inside .gitignore ? - helpful when someone clones the repo and uses the lockfile to download the deps - more consistent installs between collaborators and travis ci https://blog.travis-ci.com/2016-11-21-travis-ci-now-supports-yarn , and other benefits of a lockfile - not helpful when published, so it should be npm ignored see below - should we use .npmignore or files ? - i personally prefer files option and less dotfiles in general - npmignore has a more safe mechanism by being opt-out, so you are more unlikely to accidentally publish with missing files unless there is a tool out there that checks for you? - how should files be cased? readme vs readme , license vs license , etc. - should we have one readme style across the board? possibly with a template scaffolding and/or tool e.g. yo https://npmjs.com/yo , generate https://npmjs.com/generate , or bp https://github.com/jamen/bp for simple stuff - should we more eagerly link back to some origin repository or page like audiojs.github.io https://audiojs.github.io or github.com/audiojs/audio https://github.com/audiojs/audio , etc. near the title area, to tie everything back together nicely. another method people seem to take is monorepos https://github.com/lerna/lerna , but that might deviate too far from the style we have established and i'm not sure about them myself yet. - how should we organize different clusters of packages with npm keywords, audiojs/docs , and so on. for example: pull-audio- packages can be categorized by a pull-audio keyword, and cli packages by audio-cli , etc.
