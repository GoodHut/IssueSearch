 URL : "https://github.com/steelbrain/linter-ui-default/issues/329" TITLE : statusbar style changed? BODY : at first i thought it was maybe a bug, but now i am wondering whether it's intentional. at any rate, the previous indicator for linter issues as seen on the current readme for this project were really slick! the new ones get the job done, but they seem to take up more space and look messier. ! image https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/354741/26331879/3c36e496-3f08-11e7-95e5-cf5ae0ad22e9.png
