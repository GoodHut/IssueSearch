 URL : "https://github.com/jetwitaussi/PHT/issues/7" TITLE : incompatibility with php7 BODY : under php7 environment, the pht\cache\void and pht\log\void are not valid class names. > fatal error: cannot use 'void' as class name as it is reserved in pht/log/void.php on line 16 what i would suggest here is that we rename the classes to something like voidcache and voidlogger , although we will introduce a naming inconsistency in the cache and log classes. another suggestion would be to rename all of the classes, i.e. voidlogger , filelogger .
