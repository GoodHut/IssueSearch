 URL : "https://github.com/humanmade/backupwordpress/issues/1170" TITLE : minor security issue BODY : this came from a plugin review done by a security company. the one issue we noticed relates to your inclusion of testing files for a couple of libraries included with the plugin. when one of those files /vendor/ifsnop/mysqldump-php/tests/test.php is requested it will cause a fatal error and display the full path of the file. the file overrides the error reporting settings of the server due to the line error_reporting e_all ; so even if a server's error reporting settings would not normally show a fatal error message's content, it would with this file. while a full path disclosure vulnerability, like this, isn't a major issue, it doesn't look like the testing files are something that needs to ship with the plugin. the testing directories we noticed are at /vendor/ifsnop/mysqldump-php/tests/ and /vendor/symfony/process/tests/.
