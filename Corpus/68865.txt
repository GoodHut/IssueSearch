 URL : "https://github.com/cgiffard/node-simplecrawler/issues/392" TITLE : sitemap parsing example BODY : hi, this is more a question rather than an issue: does this crawler supports sitemaps referenced in robots.txt-files? looking up the code i'd say no, but there is a pr that indicates that sitemaps are somewhat supported. would anybody be able to link to an example of simplecrawler using a sitemap?
