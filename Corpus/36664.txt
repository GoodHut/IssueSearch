 URL : "https://github.com/piwik/piwik-log-analytics/issues/166" TITLE : iis 6.0 imports fail BODY : hi, i've beaten my head on this for a while now, but as best i can tell iis 6.0 log format is not supported? when i set the format as iis i run into various failures, the closest i get is eventually all log lines failing as invalid lines. i've been digging through the python code, and it seems like there is nothing in the regexes code that handles comma delimited log lines which iis 6.0 logging format produces can you clarify is iis 6.0 log format is expected to work? is the iis setting only support to work with w3c format iis logs? specifically time in milliseconds? note my log files, to make things worse, don't have any headers daily roll overs
