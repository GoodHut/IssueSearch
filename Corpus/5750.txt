 URL : "https://github.com/HonzaKral/django-threadedcomments/issues/92" TITLE : sort on newest BODY : i'm sorry for taking this approach but i wanted to sort the comments so the most recent would be first. i've forked this, made a couple of amendments and it seems to work using {% render_comment_list for object newest %} but i don't know how to offer it back to the community so you can review and make part of master.
