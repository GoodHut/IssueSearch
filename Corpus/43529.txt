 URL : "https://github.com/TakeTenGaming/Aeonix/issues/7" TITLE : create update checker BODY : an update checker should be simple enough to achieve, and i feel like it's more than worth adding. - add a version.json file to the repository - create class updatechecker - checkforupdates will load the specified file and return a bool on whether there's a newer version available - setfile sets the file to load for checking versions possibly default to the version.json in this repo?
