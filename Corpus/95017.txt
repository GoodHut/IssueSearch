 URL : "https://github.com/eclipse/hono/issues/344" TITLE : consistent api definitions BODY : from users perspective it, would be nice, if both device registration api and credentials api are defined in the same manner. after a first analysation of both apis, it turned out that the biggest difference between them is the return code of update and delete operations. for example: device registration api: updatedevice ... https://github.com/eclipse/hono/blob/master/service-base/src/main/java/org/eclipse/hono/service/registration/registrationservice.java operation returns status code 200 ok and the old registration value value to be updated . credentials api: updatecredentials ... https://github.com/eclipse/hono/blob/master/service-base/src/main/java/org/eclipse/hono/service/credentials/credentialsservice.java operation returns status code 204 created . same difference exists when deleting device registrations and device credentials. when thinking about equalizing both apis, the simplest approach would be to let the device registration return 204 analog to credentials api on update and delete operation. that raises two questions, we would like to address in this issue: - is there any reason not to equalize both apis? - is there any reason not to change the current device registration api as proposed above?
