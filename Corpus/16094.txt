 URL : "https://github.com/matt57225/bovada-hand-history-converter/issues/1" TITLE : hh not being read BODY : i've followed the steps outlined for installing the hh converter and was able to get the program to run see attached image , but i can't seem to get any hands actually converted. - the input directory i'm using is c:\program files x86 \betonline\history\ , which is where my betonline history.db file is stored. - as an output directory i'm using a folder that i created on my desktop - as a move processed directory i'm using a subfolder in the output directory. i've tried it with and without this option by un-/checking the checkbox. i've tried this with the betonline application running and without and neither has worked. i also checked the box to save errors to file, but nothing comes up. is there something i'm doing wrong? thank you, arcenis <img width= 252 alt= hhconverter src= https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8401281/31525717-5f2e2218-af90-11e7-8be3-4543d3524d1f.png >
