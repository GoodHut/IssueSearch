 URL : "https://github.com/feren-OS/feren-OS-Bug-Reporting/issues/11" TITLE : a few issues BODY : please check the blog, i mentioned there something in the rc thread , but i'll remove my posts as soon as you'll confirm you did read what's there. i didn't intend to create a new account for the feren-os-bug-reporting page, but since you have had no reaction on blog.... about the language/locales problem, which affects the update manager with some specific languages , the menu any menu containing shortcuts to the folders within home , and even the settings manager though this seems to be solved in the rc, but it deserves to be double-checked i suggest talking with our common friend. i told him something about this issue in feren.
