 URL : "https://github.com/nextcloud/nextcloudpi/issues/53" TITLE : continuing tar.bz2 issue BODY : i'm at a loss... the reason i checked the md5sum is because after i downloaded and untarred the tar.bz2, i burnt the image on a fresh sandisk ultra 32g card using the; sudo dd bs=4m if=nextcloudpi_06-28-17.img of=/dev/sda1 inserting into a new pi3 and applying power... no boot sequence or flashing light on board :- ... had monitor and keyboard attached. thought maybe had a bad card so repeated process with a fresh sd same spec ... still no boot? then repeated download, untar, burn onto reformatted sd 2 ... again the same. i have another fresh pi3 but don't think that is the issue... any help appreciated.
