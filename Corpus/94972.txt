 URL : "https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL/issues/408" TITLE : concept of collidablegroup BODY : using collidablecomponent we can provide further information about groups. use case: the player and enemies can shoot the same bullet type. however, we don't want the enemy bullet to hit any other enemies, so by providing group information, we can prevent a particular bullet instance from colliding with enemies / player, etc. the implementation of this should also provide a bridge to box2d collidable groups, so that the high-level api is same for both.
