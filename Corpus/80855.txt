 URL : "https://github.com/braidchat/planning/issues/330" TITLE : use a different database BODY : reasons to consider an alternative to datomic: - it's not open source, and so, is a chink in the 'braid is an open-source system' angle - high resource usage, even for small set-ups minimum of ~4gb of ram - not making much use of datomic's key advantages history, immutability - vertical scaling will cost $ - potential contributors may have more exposure with other dbs reasons to keep datomic - closely tied to clojure ecosystem - datalog is awesome - not worth effort of rewriting existing code - very flexible data model potential alternatives: postgres - tried and true, well known - lots of managed hosting available rethinkdb - mongo but better - change feed api although other dbs have that too - built in scale / shard / replication management ui couchdb http://couchdb.apache.org/ - change feed - replication - still active? given couchbase using a different core? cassandra?
http://cassandra.apache.org/ h2
http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html - could be bundled as a java dependency other? factors to consider: - ease of set-up for contributors - overhead for small set-ups think: 1 team of 5 people - performance / ability to scale - ease of developing for how well does api match our needs - ease of on-boarding new contributors - change feed support - full-text search performance or perhaps just use lucene - managed hosting availability
