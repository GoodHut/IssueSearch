 URL : "https://github.com/jaagr/polybar/issues/694" TITLE : only update systemtray BODY : hello, this isn't really an issue, but more of a question. i set up my i3 config so that i can quickly restart my polybar. but i was also wondering if there is a command where i can also quickly restart just my systemtray, because the only main reason i restart my polybar is so that i can align the items on my systemtray.
