 URL : "https://github.com/choojs/choo/issues/547" TITLE : namespace for choo events BODY : from the discussion in nanocomponent 45 https://github.com/choojs/nanocomponent/issues/45 , what do you say about a namespace for events. i can see two benefits, 1 it would prevent dumb errors like mine in the nanocomponent issue thread, and 2 it would be consistent with, for instance, choo-log, and any other namespaced choo plugin.
