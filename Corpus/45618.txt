 URL : "https://github.com/Cxbx-Reloaded/Cxbx-Reloaded/issues/223" TITLE : improve fiber support BODY : our current method of implementing fibers is very poor. rather than switch to a specific requested fiber, when a title calls switchtofiber, we currently run all registered fibers, then reset the fiber counter to 0. the 'right' way would be to remove our fiber patches and let the kernel handle it, but this is not possible until we implement our own thread context switching rather than relying on windows, until then, we require patches. these patches need to be modified to perform closer to the xbox implementation.
