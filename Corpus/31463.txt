 URL : "https://github.com/KentorIT/authservices/issues/692" TITLE : single logout issue BODY : i'm facing some issues with single logout action using kentor authservice. i have implemented this way let me know if i'm missing any configurations to achieve single logout. from the application we kill all session and cookies and redirect to kentor api ~/authservices/logout. so when i test logout it doesn't really send saml logout request to idp still user is active on idp side. when we set different certificate file in <servicecertificates> section single sign on is getting disturbed. but my understanding is this <servicecertificates> section is only for single logout. please let me know if i'm missing anything.
