 URL : "https://github.com/Automattic/simplenote-ios/issues/124" TITLE : spotlight security issue BODY : hey, the new spotlight search works great but there is a security issue. when searching with spotlight the search results reveal the full content of notes even when touchid is enabled. that means that the security feature of simplenote is not secure anymore. further more, when tapping on the spotlight search result, simplenote opens the full note and asks for touchid confirmation while the content of the note is shown. ! img_2433 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4397364/22019463/61080682-dcbc-11e6-9c01-5afa80e22c8b.png ! img_2434 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4397364/22019464/610eb48c-dcbc-11e6-95e0-429cc15908a9.png a possible fix would be for spotlight to search only for titles or tags instead of the full content of the notes. when tapping on the results simplenote should be protecting the content of the note until touchid is used.
