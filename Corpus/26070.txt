 URL : "https://github.com/ncw/rclone/issues/1314" TITLE : add relative option BODY : it would be handy to allow to recreate the entire directory branch relative to some given root this is possible using rsync . currently you can get that in linux using something like $ realpath --relative-to $base_path $path as rclone argument. for example, if pwd = a/b , copying c/d/e relative to a should create b/c/d/e at the target fs, not only c/d/e .
