 URL : "https://github.com/singularityhub/singularityhub.github.io/issues/74" TITLE : usage page not complete BODY : usage is not clear enough on how do download a specific container e.g. https://www.singularity-hub.org/collections/114/usage for instance, container may be from different releases branch / master but i do not see how to retrieve the specific develop version right now. similarly, i believe that in the previous hub version, there was a way to download a container thanks to its identifier, but i do not see that option in the usage page anymore. thanks
