 URL : "https://github.com/moretea/yarn2nix/issues/9" TITLE : very slow nix fetches BODY : nix is very slow to fetch npm dependencies compared to yarn. something like 100 times slower . and based on my local sample set, node projects tend to have a lot of dependencies. here are some stats of local repos: frontend: 79 direct dependencies, 1166 dependencies frontend-marketing: 8 direct dependencies, 579 dependencies yarn2nix: 1 direct dependency, 179 dependencies i believe the main issue to be that nix doesn't reuse tcp or tls session between fetches. the fetch parallelism is also currently constrained to the max-jobs setting. here is just a benchmark to illustrate my point: bash $ cd path/to/yarn2nix $ nix-collect-garbage -d $ time nix-build . -a yarn2nix real	2m35.543s user	0m27.199s sys	0m12.954s $ rm -rf $ yarn cache dir node_modules $ time yarn real	0m5.179s user	0m4.843s sys	0m2.454s
