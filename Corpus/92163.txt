 URL : "https://github.com/Didel/HomeKitCam/issues/4" TITLE : video stream not working? BODY : this might be a duplicate of 3, but i'm having a slightly different issue. the snapshots work fine with the camera, but the stream does not load at all. i can wait as long as i want, but the camera will still keep trying and the script will still keep printing the command over and over again. has anybody gotten this to work?
