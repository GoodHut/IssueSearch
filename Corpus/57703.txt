 URL : "https://github.com/KevCJones/angularx-bootstrap-modal/issues/4" TITLE : refactor and document. BODY : a quick code review has found some obvious undocumented todo's e.g. dialogoptions having a file but the exported interface still lives inside dialog.service.ts . the comments are sometimes a bit redundant, i'd like to generate some documentation, which will feed from the comments. this should help me get a firmer grasp on the code base so i can take on community issues and requests. i will pull from the original repo for issues when the ones here have been handled
