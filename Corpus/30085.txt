 URL : "https://github.com/MaartenBaert/ssr/issues/556" TITLE : no video or preview BODY : hello thanks for building a simple but feature complete screen recorder! unfortunately i cannot get the video capture to work. i have tried all different video formats, and my audio is recorded and plays back, but the playback screen is just black. the preview is also black. i have tried using different screen sizes, same problem. the mouse pointer gets recorded, but everything behind it is black. i have tried playback with vlc and mediaplayer. have you got any tips on how to work out what is wrong? cheers ant
