 URL : "https://github.com/chirpradio/chirpradio/issues/19" TITLE : expose dj user id in api BODY : the expression engine website http://chirpradio.org uses the api https://code.google.com/archive/p/chirpradio/wikis/thechirpapi.wiki to synchronize user data. to help it synchronize data more efficiently, the api should expose the user id of the dj. this will address bugs like ones where non-ascii characters such as dashes cause data synchronization errors. however, utilizing the new id requires changes on the expression engine website. here is an example of what the current api returns: $ curl 'https://chirpradio.appspot.com/api/current_playlist' | jq .now_playing { played_at_local_ts : 1510334958, dj : dj stevo , artist : jc brooks , track : o.n.o. , ... } two fields should be added to this as well as the recently_played array: dj_id_for_chirpradio_org -- this would be the id of the user from the expression engine db. this already gets stored in app engine as external_id https://github.com/chirpradio/chirpradio/blob/427ec60a0a9ebde05766119b1c4aa491323bdf45/auth/tasks.py l43 . dj_id -- this would be the internal app engine datastore id of the user. this won't solve any immediate problem it just seems like it could be useful.
