 URL : "https://github.com/grafana/simple-json-datasource/issues/48" TITLE : install docs feedback BODY : i just installed this plugin and it wasn't clear to me what to install. i figured out by looking at the other plugins and a process of trial and error that i needed to install the content of the dist dir to public/app/plugins/datasource/<id> and that <id> is defined in plugin.json in this case grafana-simple-json-datasource . am i understanding this correctly? if so, you might like to update the docs? thanks! r.
