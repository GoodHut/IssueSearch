 URL : "https://github.com/bpampuch/pdfmake/issues/1196" TITLE : rounded table borders? BODY : i'm evaluating pdfmake for a very specific use case, and the client needs to have table borders that are rounded and colored. in some cases, the entire table has four rounded corners, in most cases its just the tl and tr corners that are rounded. every other thing we do is covered by pdfmake except this. looking at the code, it doesn't look like this would be possible with tables themselves, but is there some way to layer a table without an outer border over the top of a canvas? knowing that the tables might be variable height, and might cross pages? i'm guessing no, but i wanted to double check to see if i was missing something. i'd be willing to work on a pr to add this feature, but looking at the table rendering code, this might not even be easy without rewriting a lot of the border code to use rects instead of lines, or to do something tricky to make lines bend corners. any ideas on what it would take to add this?
