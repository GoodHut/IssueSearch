 URL : "https://github.com/Cxbx-Reloaded/Cxbx-Reloaded/issues/268" TITLE : oovpa guidelines needed BODY : as there are now multiple people contributing to the oovpa hle database, we need a set of guidelines to follow when creating oovpas to reduce the risk of regressions. library functions are relocatable, so portions can differ between titles, even those that use the same xdk version. because of this, the offsets used have to be carefully chosen so that they will be the same even after relocation. good candidates to use are: - opcodes that use segement registers these very rarely change - constants not memory offsets - relative conditional jumps absolute jump addresses may differ
