 URL : "https://github.com/SirCmpwn/sway/issues/1365" TITLE : get duplicate workspaces BODY : i'm seeing the workspace 2 appear twice in my right monitor in i3 manage bar screen below . i assume there are actually two 2 workspaces and this is not an issue with the bar. i couldn't find an existing issue like this. i think this happened after i moved a workspace from one monitor to the other. i cannot access the second 2 in any logical way. somehow i wind up on one versus the other but i can't see a pattern. i can move the first 2 workspace around but there are always 2 of them. please let me know if you want conf lines etc. btw - swaygrab requires imagemagick got a convert not found error but sway/swaygrab installs without it. i guess most people have it already? added output of swaymsg -rt get_workspaces ! 2017-09-22-114222_swaygrab https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7500216/30753439-49936598-9f8d-11e7-9ff8-a3c682cb292e.png wokspace-dump.txt https://github.com/sircmpwn/sway/files/1325091/wokspace-dump.txt
