 URL : "https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python/issues/527" TITLE : notebooks on a server BODY : i have been thinking how to combat the current issue of notebooks unable to run code in github, execute javascript and do stuff in general . i believe a good solution is to host the notebooks on an external server. a friend of mine used heroku https://www.heroku.com/ for something similar and i think we could get the notebooks to work on there or similar services . i have not looked into this yet. if this is an option we want to explore, i will give it a look.
