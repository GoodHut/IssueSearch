 URL : "https://github.com/debops/ansible-libvirtd/issues/21" TITLE : ignore not working BODY : hi im trying debops.libvirtd and run into a problem: i do get an error thrown in generate libvirt configuration files - variable parameters is undefined. if i change change ignore to comment in the variable libvirtd__default_configuration , then it works. i also have to comment out the unix_sock_group stuff. i think there is something with the template - but i cant figure it out. br, /////bj√∂rne
