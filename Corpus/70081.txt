 URL : "https://github.com/Warped2713/OmniSim/issues/28" TITLE : update to unity 5.6 api BODY : - re-import standard assets image effects
- update shaders using unity_matrix_mv - for better performance, always prefer unityobjecttoclippos and unityobjecttoviewpos if you are transforming vertices into clip space and view space respectively. https://unity3d.com/unity/beta/unity5.6.0b3
- use unloadsceneasync instead of unloadscene
