BODY : hello g810-led community, awesome work you have done already! : so the idea for naming, i was thinking about the name logiled . unless the software should be able to control multiple vendors their keyboards i think logiled will suffice for this piece of software. since people are already trying to add their mouse to the software and stuff, i think we should leave out any model number out of the name. thanks for reading, and happy coding! p.s.: this is my first time trying to 'contribute' somehow to something. so i hope this will work and is done properly. if not, let me know!
