 URL : "https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/issues/9" TITLE : centos and apache 2.2.15 BODY : have a user using centos and apache 2.2.15. had problems getting the bot blocker working. i setup a test bench and can confirm the bot blocker version_2 works 100% perfectly with centos and apache 2.2. i will be pushing out a centos specific version with configuration instructions within the next day or two. for now here's a temporary workaround https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/issues/8 until the centos specific version of the bot blocker is released, possibly in the morning.
