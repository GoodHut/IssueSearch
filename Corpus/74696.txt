 URL : "https://github.com/pry/pry/issues/1600" TITLE : feature request: apropos BODY : in lisp, you can type apropos substring , and you'll get a list of every interned symbol that matches the substring, with information on what package it's in, whether it's a function, macro, or special variable, and more. it would be useful to be able to do this in pry. which methods in what classes match create_ ? which class has an instance variable called @frobs ? etc. it would be even better if this facility could produce references to instances of a class. i'd love to be able to fetch an existing instance of goodluckinstantiatingthisactiverecordthingybyhand .
