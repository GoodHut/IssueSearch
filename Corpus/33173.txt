 URL : "https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/stackstorm-puppet/issues/4" TITLE : add actions for bolt BODY : not sure if this should be in here, or a separate pack, but i at least wanted to write it down. puppet released a new open source project called bolt that can do remote execution: - docs: https://puppet.com/docs/bolt/0.x/bolt.html - repo: https://github.com/puppetlabs/bolt would be great to have the ability to trigger this via stackstorm similar to ansible playbook . i'm willing to work on this unless someone beats me to it.
