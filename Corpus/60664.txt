 URL : "https://github.com/kuuurt13/ng-block-ui/issues/6" TITLE : add angular 4.x support BODY : issue currently there is no support for 4.0, see 1. at the moment, angular is on 4.0.0-rc.1 and 4.0.0 final is scheduled to officially release on 2017-03-22 https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/docs/release_schedule.md . unfortunately, building ng-block-ui for 4.x is not backwards with 2.x. proposal since the official release is a few weeks off and it will take a while for everyone to upgrade to 4.0. i think it would be best if a next tag was create in npm this is what the angular team currently uses for future releases . i will be starting at 1.0.0-beta.0 and support 4.x. any features/fixes added to the current version 0.3.0 will be added into this version. once i feel like angular 4.0 is being widely adopted i will point the npm latest tag to 1.0.0 so that will be the default when installing from npm.
