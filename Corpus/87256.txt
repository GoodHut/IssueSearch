 URL : "https://github.com/Wikifab/mediawiki-extension-VEForPageForm/issues/1" TITLE : js scripts are not loaded BODY : i tried this extension, but cannot make it working without modification. here is my analysis. i installed veforpageform 7ffb5bb on a mediawiki 1.28.2 rel1_28 - 01d41df + pageforms 4.0 rel1_28 - 08ca024 + visualeditor rel1_28 - 93528b7 , added in a form a field with {{{field|texteve|input type=textarea|class=form-textarea}}} and nothing happened the form was loaded as usual, with a classical textarea on this field . then i dived in the extension and found the hook formedit::showeditform:initial was non-existant in my installation. i searched some hook in pageforms, found for instance pfhtmlbeforeform , and registered in veforpageform/extension.json the function veforpageform\hooks::start in this hook, and the ve was then loaded in the form as expected. iâ€™m not sure the hook pfhtmlbeforeform is appropriate, i did this as a quick hack.
