 URL : "https://github.com/roikku/swift-explorer/issues/70" TITLE : no resume for download BODY : i've uploaded a huge backup set ~300gb to hubic via synology hyper backup. now i want to perform a desktop restore of the full data set simulating a loss of my synology nas but this can hardly be done in one go, due to network connection lossess, isp reset every 24h, etc. whenever i restart the download the swift explorer starts from the scratch without considering the files i already downloaded. please advise or fix, otherwise this toll is useless for me. thanks, s
