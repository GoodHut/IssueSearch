 URL : "https://github.com/elysium-project/server/issues/3028" TITLE : disconnected after loading BODY : for the past week or so every time i log in it loads all the way but after a few seconds in game i get disconnected from server. i have tried running in admin, double and triple checking my relamlist, and config file, i have changed the dns setup, and made sure it has a firewall exemption. i am at a loss.
