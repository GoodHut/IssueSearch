 URL : "https://github.com/zalando-incubator/solution-center-login/issues/82" TITLE : user agent mismatch BODY : we removed the user agent check in version 3.0.0. however, since we are no longer sending the user agent in the post to /tokens , it does not appear in the token. this causes library versions below 3.0.0 to reject the token since the user agent does not match. the result is that tokens issued by services using the new version 3.0.0+ are not accepted by services using the old version <3.0.0 , thereby breaking sso during migration. we should restore the code that sends the user agent in the new version the user agent check does not need to be restored and remove it in a future version only once everyone is up to 3.0.0+.
