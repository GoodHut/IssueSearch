 URL : "https://github.com/NicolasPetton/Indium/issues/45" TITLE : breakpoints not hit BODY : indium : 20170504.117 gnu emacs: 25.1.1 chrome : 58.0.3029.96 64-bit app uses oracle jet 3.0.0 which uses require.js and knockout. the top index file has <script data-main= ui/js/main src= jet-v3.0.0/js/libs/require/require.js ></script> i start up chrome via: open -n /applications/google chrome.app --args --user-data-dir=/tmp/hcchromedebuguserdatadir/ --remote-debugging-port=9222 http://localhost:8080/ui/ i then do indium-connect-to-chrome it asks for host/port/tab i reload the page and it hits a breakpoint that i did not set. chrome says paused in emacs debugger emacs shows the code it is stopped at in a buffer named js debugger i press s and see: returnfromlogin <http://localhost:8080/ui/ui/js/utils.js> closure <http://localhost:8080/ui/ui/js/main.js> everything seems to work at this breakpoint e.g., locals, following links, etc . problem: if i visit either of those files or any other javascript file in the project and explicitly set a breakpoint, the app never stops at the breakpoint.
