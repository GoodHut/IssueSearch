BODY : i am now trying to build a lstm encoder decoder framework using sonnet and tensorflow. i understand sonnet have the lstm module involved. i was trying to build encoder decoder with tf.contrib.seq2seq.decoder. however, i am not sure if this one builds encoder implicitly, and the decoder_inputs are encoder_input? since in my case, i do not have any input for decoder but the output from previous step... is there any warpper in sonnet for this kind of issue? can you suggest some proper way to do this?
