 URL : "https://github.com/IdentityModel/oidc-client-js/issues/375" TITLE : managing user profile BODY : hi all, in instances where you have multiple clients and a central identityserver 4 instance which handles user auth/n, how would you go about managing user profiles from individual clients? current scenario: 1. user clicks on manage profile 2. user is redirected to a custom manage claims page on identityserver which a loads all claims in a form, b allows user to mod such claims and c updates them with new values 3. user is redirected to the referrer url which then retrieves these fresh claims via a token refresh which includes the profile scope - although a redirect is not always possible, or is frowned upon from a design perspective users' experience is broken since they are taken to a different location with a different design . desired scenario: 1. user clicks on manage profile 2. user is redirected to a profile page on the client itself e.g. spa or desktop , populated with info from the _profile scope_ 3. user updates profile data, and client then makes an api call to identityserver to update the users' claims centrally 4. local claims are refreshed to reflect claims sent to identity server _main concern:_ is this a sound approach architecturally speaking? should user profiles e.g. first/last name, gender, dob, etc... be managed by identityserver via an api or own pages or should these be stored centrally and used/managed by both identityserver loaded as claims and individual client apps? how would you go about tackling the desired scenario? the closest info i got was in _method 3_ discussed here http://bitoftech.net/2015/03/31/asp-net-web-api-claims-authorization-with-asp-net-identity-2-1/ . ... however it's a 3+ year old doc, and am not sure what is recommended by oidc-client/identityserver 4 devs today. any insights would be highly appreciated. chris
