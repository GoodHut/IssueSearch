 URL : "https://github.com/MeerkatLabs/autology/issues/14" TITLE : configure storage engine BODY : need to remove assumptions in the storage engine: - git initialize - command that will initialize the storage plugin that has been configured if it has not been initialized already - cannot be done during the initialization command because the configuration file has not been modified yet - remote named origin - allow configuration to name the remote that should be used by default. - all work done in the master branch - allow configuration to name the remote refspec that should be used when pushing and pulling content - provide a none storage engine that will be used by default
