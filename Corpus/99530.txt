 URL : "https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/issues/132" TITLE : more detail on api version BODY : it would be useful if there were a little more detail in the spec around api versioning. how is versioning defined here and for what intention? what behaviour is expected of a client and server e.g. if their versions don't match ? examples: - you might want to state that x-broker-api-version header is required e.g. client must include it in requests; server must include it in responses, etc. - you might want to declare semantic versioning / or behaviour like must deny requests with invalid api versions as follows, etc.
