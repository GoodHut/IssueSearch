 URL : "https://github.com/benefitcloud/ember-uploader/issues/149" TITLE : modifying request headers BODY : i need to add a custom header required for authorization when doing the sign request prior to an s3 upload. you mentioned here https://github.com/benefitcloud/ember-uploader modifying-the-request that it's possible to add additional headers by extending emberuploader.uploader like so: import emberuploader from 'ember-uploader'; export default emberuploader.uploader.extend { ajaxsettings: { headers: { 'x-application-name': 'uploader test' } } } ; however it's not obvious to me where i should add this, in which file and in which folder? so far i've setup a component called s3-upload which extends emberuploader.filefield and within it i've defined my filesdidchange method. this is all working as expected but just trying to figure out how to go about overriding the ajaxsettings.headers object.
