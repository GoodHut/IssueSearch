 URL : "https://github.com/18F/concourse-compliance-testing/issues/128" TITLE : shrink the pipeline BODY : short of concourse having additional features to handle what i'm calling multi-object builds https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/292 , having the large number of groups in a single pipeline is no longer working; for starters, the group names no longer wrap, so the ones off to the right are no longer clickable. ! screen shot 2017-01-12 at 6 06 30 pm https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/86842/21912108/f5f05566-d8f1-11e6-827b-2cfb54bd9fd8.png since concourse now supports teams and https://github.com/18f/concourse-compliance-testing/pull/127 will recommend having a dedicated team for these scans , i suggest we instead generate one pipeline per site, rather than one group per site. there are tradeoffs like not being able to easily pause all at once , but i think it's worthwhile.
