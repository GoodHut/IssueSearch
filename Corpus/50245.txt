 URL : "https://github.com/hmil/topside/issues/15" TITLE : why use source-maps ? BODY : hi, why do you use source-maps and hence compressed/obfuscated main source when going from template.top.html to {template.top.ts, template.top.ts.map} ? the result is that template.top.ts is a bit cryptic to understand. similarly, when one makes mistakes in assigning the parameters, the compiler yields: main.ts 5,5 : argument of type '{ name: string; name3: string; }' is not assignable to parameter of type '__params'. without source-maps, __params could be nameoffile_toptemplate_params , or something that is more informative.
