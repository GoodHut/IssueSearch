 URL : "https://github.com/status-im/status-go/issues/383" TITLE : implement rinkeby faucet BODY : problem there's no way to request test rinkeby ether for our users. implementation 1. implement a separate application which collects ether from public rinkeby faucets and send it to 0xadaf150b905cf5e6a778e553e15a139b6618bbb7 for further distribution to our users. 2. fix github.com/status-im/faucet to be able to send ether to rinkeby addresses without losing backward-compatibility. acceptance criteria 1. there's an application github.com/status-im/rinkebyminer which collects rinkeby ether from various public sources the name is negotiable . 2. rinkebyminer regularly steals ether but doesn't steal too much. say, 10 ether a day is fine. notes note that there will be more test networks and it's better to lay proper foundation for those additions. future steps contact @tiabc to deploy the new rinkebyminer and re-deploy faucet.
