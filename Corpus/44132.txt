 URL : "https://github.com/urbit/urbit/issues/818" TITLE : egz.hope is corrupt j BODY : i managed to corrupt my event log by running a planet under tmux then attempting to start the same planet from a different console. while starting this second instance i remembered the first and attempted to halt the process through many repleated ^cs and ^ds. when i attempted to start the planet again i saw that my logfile had been corrupted. i'm happy to supply my logfile or key as there is nothing of consequence on my planet. let me know if this is an issue you intend to look into.
