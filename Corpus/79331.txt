 URL : "https://github.com/NeuroML/jNeuroML/issues/53" TITLE : separate -run and -build BODY : currently -neuron -run will both compile the model files and run the model. however, in some cases i would only like to compile the model files i.e. produce the entire generated x86_64 directory but not run the model. without -run i get a python script and some .mod files, but this appears insufficient to actually run the model. in pyneuroml, pynml.py line 110 says: -run ' ' compile nmodl files and run the main neuron ' ' hoc file linux only currently ' suggesting that -run is in fact doing both the compilation and the running. if i understand this correctly, i would like to request that compilation and running be separated via a -build flag, so that i could compile but not run.
