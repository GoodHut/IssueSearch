the carrying capacity of a pack animal is 1600 stones, horses and llamas both require one follower slot. attach=full 9160 /attach attach=full 9161 /attach so i get a page from a player wondering why yesterday their pack horse could hold 3k items but at times it will not let it go above 1600 items, the following conversation took place which you can read. in short though - if a pack horses is being auto fed the same type of ore it will go above the 1600 limit. it will not let you add new items above the 1600 cap but if you are adding to a pile of already existing ore it will go on forever. my guess is this happens to all stackables. not sure the last time this was edited but now it is bugged. reported by: tasanar report thread: http://servuo.com/threads/pack-animal-bug-on-servuo.7625/
