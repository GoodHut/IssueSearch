 URL : "https://github.com/Thoughtscript/example-spring-starter/issues/1" TITLE : reviewing and finising up BODY : ok. so some conflicting resources here and there. may be wrong. the app starters are not standalone .jars though the documentation says the can be used as such . so, they need to embedded into a larger app. i was thinking of using kafka, but have decided to see if i can stripe it down one dependency further. so, reviewing and finishing up.
