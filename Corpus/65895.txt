 URL : "https://github.com/benjamn/reify/issues/180" TITLE : live binding incomplete BODY : in adding a unit test for modifying a constant value i noticed a gap. const.js js export const value = 1 test.js js import { value } from ./const.js value = 2 // should throw since value is a const. it should throw since value is a const but currently reify doesn't track import values, wrapping them in a setter call, and defines value with either var or let .
