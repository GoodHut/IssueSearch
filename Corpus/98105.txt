BODY : hi, i know unitystudio wasn't conceived to import meshes into a unity game but i would like to hear your opinion about this approach: - i exported a mesh from a game using unitystudio with everything from materials to bones exported . i got an fbx file i can open without any issues in 3dsmax. - i created an empty project/scene in unity personal the exact same version as the one used to make the game , imported my fbx and built a bogus .exe. - from the sharedassets0 coming with the exe i just built, i used uabe to export my mesh as a raw unity file .dat - using uabe i imported my raw unity mesh into the original game and replaced the original mesh - in theory the mesh shouldn't have been modified in the process, right? - i got a mesh with only the skeleton showing and apparently materials and textures somehow applied on the bones... the result i got https://s1.postimg.org/1vmq5h2wdb/mesh.jpg my question is: what could possibly go wrong? before trying to import modified meshes, i'd like to understand what step i'm missing thanks
