BODY : the authentication subsection of the overview part of the spec says when you sign up for an account, you are given your first api key. ok, great! i want one, how do i get one? some place near the top of the document should tell me this. and how does api key authorisation work what can any given api key holder do with their keys ? maybe there should be comments about this in the documentation of relevant methods.
