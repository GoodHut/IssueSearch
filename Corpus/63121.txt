 URL : "https://github.com/serverless-heaven/serverless-webpack/issues/223" TITLE : dependencies not packed BODY : hi, as i understand, dependencies are packed if : - they are listed under dependencies in package.json and - they are part of webpack compilation chunks i.e. are imported in user's code what's the use of the second condition ? a dependency can be in package.json and not directly used in code : in the case of a peer-dependency of other dependencies... however if not packed these dependencies will crash... cheers ! ps : the solution i use for this is to import the peer-dependency in my handler.js without actually doing anything with it.
