 URL : "https://github.com/anjdreas/roslyn-analyzers/issues/1" TITLE : enable for types BODY : it would be really nice to be able to enable this on a single type similar to this // object_assignall enable class public class mysillyclass { public guid foo { get; set; } public string bar { get; set; } } and then in all other places in the code where i am using this class i could get this analysis for just this class. i think this would be a super-useful feature although i admit that i have zero experience in roslyn analyzers and maybe doing this is really hard .
