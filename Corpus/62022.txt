 URL : "https://github.com/llSourcell/How_to_make_a_text_summarizer/issues/6" TITLE : can't get past training BODY : siraj, i forked this repo and added a parser for the signal dataset; also a frozen list of working packages. can you let me know if this model trains successfully for you? has anyone been able to get this working? i'm not sure what a 'typical' training time is on the signal dataset and/or if there's any subtle bugs in the code/parser written. any review appreciated. dlnd student lrparser
