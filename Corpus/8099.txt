 URL : "https://github.com/AppFolioOnboarding/image-sharer-RitamBanerjee/issues/14" TITLE : modify tag list BODY : as a user i want to edit the tag list for an image. __story__: image tags are awesome -- our user's love them! tags help us make sense of the
plethora of images added to our system. but how annoying is it when our users
make spelling mistakes in their image tags? super annoying! how awesome, and
useful would it be to allow for tags to be edited after an image is added?
super awesome, and useful! __acceptance criteria__:
- there is a link to edit the tags for an image.
- the image whose tags are to be modified is displayed on the edit page.
- on the edit page, i can change the tags to any valid tag list.
- after saving the edit page with valid tags, my changes are visible throughout the rest of the application. __discussion__:
- should an image's url be editable? __dependencies__:
- image tags
- refactor flow tests to use page objects
