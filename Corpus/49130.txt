 URL : "https://github.com/faceyspacey/react-universal-component/issues/38" TITLE : support with electron BODY : hello @faceyspacey i was messing around with electron and especially electron-react-boilerplate for trying to make an electron app. i succeeded to adapt my code to electron-react-boilerplate but i have an issue when the code use universal-component. to expose the issue, i forked the electron-react-boilerplate and added a loadable universal component as you can see here : https://github.com/guillaumecisco/electron-react-boilerplate/tree/gcisco-universal-component-support careful about the selected branch you can see the changes here : https://github.com/guillaumecisco/electron-react-boilerplate/pull/1/files if you try the command npm run start from the electron-react-boilerplate project without modifying it, it works great. but at the moment i insert the universal-component module, it breaks like that: ! screenshot_2017-09-04_15-26-10 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1155244/30028777-b2cb89b0-9186-11e7-9c23-af657f291921.png it wants to load file:///home/<username>/projects/electron-react-boilerplate/dist/0.renderer.prod.js . but this file is in the same directory of renderer.prod.js : file:///home/<username>/projects/electron-react-boilerplate/app/dist/renderer.prod.js note the missing app . i'm sure this is a little issue with publicpath configuration or flushchunks missing, but i absolutely don't know where to start with. do you have any idea? thank you in advance : don't hesitate to ask for more information. i know this is not really an issue with react-universal-component, but clearly don't know how to integrate it here :/
