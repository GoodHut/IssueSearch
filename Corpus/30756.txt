 URL : "https://github.com/pelagios/recogito2/issues/376" TITLE : quick mode for tags BODY : i've been playing with recogito2 on a local deployment for a couple of days and think it could be incredibly useful. thanks for all your work. i'd be interested in using tags in quick mode, which iiuc was one of the unimplemented ui features referenced in 40. is this still planned? my goal is actually to annotate text for entities other than people and places. so defining custom annotation types would of course be ideal. but if using tags + types together instead, having quick mode for tags would greatly reduce friction.
