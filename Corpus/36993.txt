 URL : "https://github.com/refinery-platform/vis-demo-utils/issues/3" TITLE : is this good enough? BODY : @scottx611x : so i'm imagining that most of this would be incorporated into refinery, with the exception of demo.js https://github.com/refinery-platform/vis-demo-utils/blob/master/src/demo.js which is the simplest possible amd which could be plugged into this framework. - is the interface sufficient? maybe there need to be tighter conventions about what is passed to the js, or maybe we want to be more explicit about the apis that the js can use to request data? - do we need a clearer deployment strategy? right now, i'm thinking that the unit that needs to be provided to refinery is the js itself... but i could also imagine just configuring it with an npm package name though i think that would make things unnecessarily complicated.
