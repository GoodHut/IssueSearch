 URL : "https://github.com/shepherdjay/pan-os-scripts/issues/25" TITLE : refractor rules as class BODY : it seems that the well defined structure of a palo alto firewall rule would fit better as its own class that could be passed around and more easily referenced then the current way i'm doing it. however i don't have much experience with classes so this is more of a shout out issue to anyone with better programming experience than myself whether using a class at this point is more trouble than its worth.
