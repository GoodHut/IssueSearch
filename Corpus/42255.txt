 URL : "https://github.com/PagerDuty/pagerduty-api-python-client/issues/14" TITLE : api feedback - create BODY : it might be nice to have a modelled-in-python version of objects. e.g. rather than passing a free form dict to create , pass in an escalationschedule object, which would allow things like 'help ' to work locally rather than having to dig up the v2 api docs from online and then translating that to python - having to guess what needs to be supplied, and whats mandatory etc.
