 URL : "https://github.com/penkavmr/Algebras/issues/2" TITLE : refactor python code BODY : once the code is converted/mostly converted, a separate version of the project in its own branch should be made in which the python code will be refactored to follow software engineering principles. imo, we should use object-oriented design patterns, and try to write the code in a way that's easy to refactor/extend.
