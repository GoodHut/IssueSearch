 URL : "https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/32119" TITLE : ansible tower api BODY : issue type - feature idea component name tower_job_list https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/lib/ansible/modules/web_infrastructure/ansible_tower/tower_job_list.py summary i would like sync configuration for ansible tower in my external database with multiple ansible tower servers. something like replication between related systems. i save my external system id and date_modified of projects/job templates/etc. to description fields of same object types inside ansible towers something like 123@1234567 . and every several minutes i run job on tower, get all id and description fields of local server, compress them and send to my external system to verify, is it okay or need create/update or delete something... so i create way to configure ansible tower via external system... so i would like to: - run tower_project_list, tower_inventory_list, tower_anything_else_list - get only id and description fields in result somehow tell ansible tower api do not return any other fields, do not spend time for that it's easy to fix first problem. we can add more files like tower_job_list.py, is it correct way or better ask user to provide option, which resources he/she would like request... really this files will be very common, except several lines job = tower_cli.get_resource 'job' so we can add more files and copy-paste most of content or rename tower_job_list.py to tower_resource_list.py add new argument to argument_spec and use it, let's say, resource_type=dict choices= 'job', 'project', 'inventory',... , what is preferred way in your opinion?.. i do not know how to fix second trouble with request only id and description fields , often its can be fixed by adding ?fields=id,description but not in case of ansible tower api... any ideas?..
