 URL : "https://github.com/CruiseDevice/twweet-cli/issues/21" TITLE : add stream listener BODY : hi guys i took a look at your project and it's pretty interesting, i would like to help as well. i was thinking why dont we add a stream listener so the user can get a constant stream of the latest tweets like on the twitter website or app without worrying about rate limits or downloading the same data over and over again. i have started adding the stream listener to the project in my forked version, please take a look at it.
