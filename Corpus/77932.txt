 URL : "https://github.com/catdog2/mpy_bme280_esp8266/issues/5" TITLE : oserror: errno 19 enodev BODY : i'm using this driver as documented in the readme file, but i keep getting the following error: bme = bme280.bme280 i2c=i2c traceback most recent call last : file <stdin> , line 1, in <module> file micropython_bme280.py , line 74, in __init__ oserror: errno 19 enodev i am also having some issues where the call to import the driver does not run the import statements in the driver; e.g. import bme280 does not run bme280_i2caddr = 0x77. regardless, then i run all of those imports and setup manually, i still get this error. for reference: - the board is an adafruit feather huzzah - firmware version 1.9 - i have not tried other firmware versions - no other devices on the bus but i confirmed that other devices work with this board and firmware config - there are no pull-up/down resistors on the pins - i2c.scan successfully returns 119 - as noted above, i changed the address to 0x77 in the driver since that's the default address per the datasheet and the i2c.scan results. also, i ran through some of the steps manually. i set up the device and registers and ran the readfrom_mem command. i was able to get the values from the register, so i know that the device works at least partially. if any additional information is needed for troubleshooting, please let me know.
