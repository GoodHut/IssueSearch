BODY : if i'm not misunderstanding the purpose of this paper, it is dealing with is issue: in intervention projects/programs, there may be heterogeneity in the effect of the tested projects/programs among sites that are receiving the treatments, which may negatively influence the effect of causal inference. why mediation mechanisms? there might be the same problem in analyses of direct impacts of projects/programs. what's special about mediation mechanisms? and if we could not treat the randomized trials as they are truly random, why the assumption of the feasibility of natural experiment is still valid?
