 URL : "https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/8356" TITLE : default max memory BODY : i've seen a lot of advice for increasing electron's max memory limit by using command-line flags. however, i don't see any advice on how to increase the limit for a distributed electron application. is it possible to increase the default max memory limit when re-branding the application for distribution? is it possible to change the default max memory limit while building electron from source?
