 URL : "https://github.com/marvinroger/homie/issues/17" TITLE : extra device properties BODY : the convention now states a limited list of device properties. i would however want to add a few more: a device could have a battery level, cpu load, free memory, temperature,... for not to break the convention, i now create a device-node with the node properties as above, which i find not entirely correct. it is working however, so if the community -and off course you marvin- doesn't agree with me, i'll stick to my current solution.
