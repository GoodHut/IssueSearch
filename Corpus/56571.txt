 URL : "https://github.com/lprhodes/homebridge-broadlink-rm/issues/211" TITLE : no buttons in home app BODY : hello, i own a braodlink rm pro 2017, which works flawlessly so far. after updating node.js from version 6.12 to 8.9.1, i installed the homebridge-broadlink-rm plugin under raspian stretch. in my config.json i added the following lines: platforms : { platform : broadlinkrm , name : broadlink rm , hidescanfrequencybutton : false, hidelearnbutton : false, accessories : }, my homebridge starts without any problem and shows that the broadling-rm plugin has found the rm pro under ipv4 adress 192.168.0.46. in addition, the log shows that there is no accesorie for the broadlinkrm platform. i now would expect a learn and a scanfrequency button within my home app under ios 11. however, i can not found such buttons. what do i have to do, in order to overcome this problem? best regards, thorsten
