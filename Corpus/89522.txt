 URL : "https://github.com/kuleshov/architect/issues/3" TITLE : question regarding format BODY : hi, i am trying to compare this tool with other similar scaffolding tools for 10 chromium data. i have a a draft genome assembled with discovar using 2x250 pcr-free pe reads and i recently got a set of 10x chromium barcoded cloud reads. i mapped it using the links-arcs approach, briefly extracting the read barcodes from the r1 and appending it to the end of the read names, then mapping with bwa using standard conditions. i can see that i need to modify the script bam2containment.py to parse the names correctly, i just wanted to know if there is any constrain int the way the barcode/well information needs to be stored i.e. does it need to be a numeric value or is it ok to use the barcode sequence? thank you!
