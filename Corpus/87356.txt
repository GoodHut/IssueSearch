 URL : "https://github.com/exelearning/iteexe/issues/250" TITLE : language code split on js BODY : there are a lot of places where language code is split and only the first half of it is used. this generates a problem with certains languages like traditional chinese as it selects the default one instead of the specific one the user has selected. we have introduced a fix for this specific problem 205 , but it is really necessary to do this split? you can see an example of this in: https://github.com/exelearning/iteexe/blob/defa8ad9acbd70881170a091573a6beb5a09d53c/exe/jsui/mainpage.py l235 seems that was @pedropena who introduced this change in 6e8a10320feb0a3923b13045081237c73b925fc8 5 years ago , do you remember why?
