 URL : "https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/issues/320" TITLE : navigation actions doc BODY : the docs for navigation actions are hard to find. there is currently an incomplete list of actions under the dispatch section of the navigation prop doc https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigators/navigation-prop . we should remove the list from that page and instead link to a new page for the actions, that can provide more thorough documentation for navigationactions . its not clear exactly where in the sidebar this doc should go, but probably in the navigators section.
