 URL : "https://github.com/uspgamedev/backdoor/issues/451" TITLE : ability belt hud? BODY : this is a hud proposal, which is creating an ability belt that is navigatable via shoulder buttons l & r in console controllers . it is basically a list of available activatable abilities . this is a list of the signature ability + all widget abilities you can perform in a turn. this basically sets a state of the current ability to point towards the ability of the list. and as such, this makes selecting a widget to activate much more user friendly. it would be somewhat like mieu ring in tales of the abyss, or item selection in zelda tp wii version . we'd have to design some cool interface for it though
