 URL : "https://github.com/chef-cft/bjc/issues/634" TITLE : speed up dca launch BODY : dca launch is currently quite slow. propose some changes to speed things up and require less lead time for demos. - make initial test kitchen warm opt-in. right now dca automatically spins up a tk instance that's not used in the vanilla demo. commenting out so that time is only spent if an sa requires tk - make use of powershell workflows to parallelize a lot of the foreach blocks. the script configures ecomacceptance on build nodes, and re-bootstraps the fleet. parallelizing this should cut down launch time significantly.
