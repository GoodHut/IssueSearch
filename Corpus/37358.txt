 URL : "https://github.com/hsluv/hsluv/issues/39" TITLE : lua 0-indexed arrays BODY : hello. i tried to use the lib in a simple lua project but i quickly went against a design issue with the current api : lua's table indexes start at 1, whereas almost the rest of the world, including haxe, starts at 0. so a classic haxe array will be a bit weird to access from lua as it might induce code such as manually setting the 0th element instead of directly using an array. this is almost an edge case, so i was wondering if wrapping or conditionnal compilation would allow us to offer to lua users a module easily useable without a weird interface.
