 URL : "https://github.com/LifeAlgorithm/VitalSourcePrinter/issues/11" TITLE : captcha of death BODY : so, i'm not sure if this is a case of virtualsource bookshelf, or of my specific ebook, but after the script prints out the first set of pages, it comes up with a captcha the second time around. of course, the halts the script right in it's tracks. there's no way that you could script around the captcha... if this is dependent on the client, is there a version of the older client floating around somewhere that i could download? if anyone else has any ideas, i'd love to hear them. i need to have this textbook in a week, and i'm trying my hardest to get it to work. frankly, i'm in over my head, so if you can help, i'd really appreciate it.
