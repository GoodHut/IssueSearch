 URL : "https://github.com/PredixDev/px-rangepicker/issues/47" TITLE : light/dark theme problem BODY : hello. on the demo page, there are 2 theme supported. lighttheme and darktheme. the same can be set on px-rangefield via --px-datetime-range-field-to-color and on px-datetime-range-panel via --px-range-panel-background-color and other styling properties. is there a way, we can set styling on px-rangepicker as well directly. currently, the documentation states nothing on it, and asks to refer to child components. i tried <style is= custom-style > px-rangepicker { px-rangepicker.px-range-panel { --px-range-panel-background-color: ff0000 ; --px-range-panel-z-index: 1000; } --px-datetime-range-field-to-color: ff0000 ; } </style> but this doesn't work. can someone help..
