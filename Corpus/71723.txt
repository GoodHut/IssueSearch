 URL : "https://github.com/kayler-renslow/arma-intellij-plugin/issues/48" TITLE : add/fix pycharms support BODY : plugin version 1.0.7 pycharms version community edition 2017.1 summary the plugin does not seem to be compatible with jetbrains pycharms detail i always thought that you could use plugins in all the editors interchangeably, yet it seems to not be the case here. after installing the plugin directly from the disk, the plugin seems to install fine. settings->plugins show arma intellij plugin with a checked checkbox, which would suggest the installation was a success and the plugin should be working. however, sqf syntax does not seem to work the sqf files look like regular text files nor the sqf templates are present settings->editor->file and code templates .
