 URL : "https://github.com/ska-sa/katdal/issues/93" TITLE : uvw sign convention issue BODY : we've converted deep2 data using h5toms.py , which seems to produce data which has a 180-degree rotation due to uvw sign convention issues. now -- we are using katdal version 0.7.1. as built from kern-2, and as released in january 2017. i see that @bmerry committed an change in april 2017 to fix upside-down meerkat images . does this mean that our version of h5toms.py does/does-not make the appropriate correction?
