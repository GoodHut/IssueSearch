 URL : "https://github.com/sindresorhus/decompress-response/issues/12" TITLE : support br encoding BODY : brotli is the arguably the best http compression algorithm available. compared to gzip, it's faster and produces smaller artifacts. there are two modules i'd consider for decompressing br responses: https://github.com/mayhemydg/iltorb https://github.com/devongovett/brotli.js the first is a native module, but from my experience runs pretty well cross-platform. cc @kevva
