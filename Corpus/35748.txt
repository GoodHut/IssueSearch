 URL : "https://github.com/nicolasbeauvais/vue-social-sharing/issues/24" TITLE : facebook send button BODY : facebook being the main social media outlet has many ways to share. one of the many is via a send button - https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/send-button this way a link can be shared directly with a friend. would be nice if this came out of the box with the plugin. good work with this so far btw, very useful.
