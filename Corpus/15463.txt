 URL : "https://github.com/HackedByChinese/ng-idle/issues/189" TITLE : dynamic timeout ? BODY : is there a way to have dynamic timeout setting ? scenario is that i have a service that fetches the timeout from backend and i want to be able to set it but i can not inject that fetcher service in config phase of the app and idle.settimeout x in run phase does not actually set my timeout properly. if i have hardcoded values like in the base example everything of course works but i think that dynamic setting would be a nice feature
