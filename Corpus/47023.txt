 URL : "https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix/issues/426" TITLE : no image-min for mix? BODY : not really an issue, but moving to laravel 5.4/mix from 5.3/elixir seems to have killed my image min functionality as it relies on gulp. trying to stick with a web pack/mix work flow what are options for automatic image min? previously i would copy images to resources/images and they would be optimised and copied to public/images. thanks
