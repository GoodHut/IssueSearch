 URL : "https://github.com/dominictarr/JSONStream/issues/135" TITLE : pipe parse and stringify BODY : hello there, thank you very much for this module. i found it was unclear how to pipe read and write altogether â€“ a type error _first argument must be a string, buffer, arraybuffer, array, or array-like object._ is reported when i try to achieve the following snippet: js fs.createreadstream file .pipe jsonstream.parse ' ' .pipe eventstream.mapsync { idvisit, actiondetails, serverdate } => { // .. var visitclean = { idvisit, actions, date: serverdate, }; return visitclean; } .pipe writer .pipe jsonstream.stringify .pipe fs.createwritestream target_dir + path.basename file any idea how to emit each object in an array in a streaming way? thanks a bunch :-
