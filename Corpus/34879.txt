 URL : "https://github.com/babel/babylon/issues/651" TITLE : create espree plugin BODY : hey! :wave: i'm just digging around babel-eslint , babylon and eslint . trying to set up some config for eslint . i always wonder why even babel-eslint exist. okey, there are reasons, but behind the scenes most of it's code base is that babylon-to-espree , so today i'm thinking why not just include it here? so then we can freely add eslint parser option to babylon , e.g. parser : babylon . currently there are three problems: 1 babel-eslint has some bugs and don't have full support and configuration of the babylon , 2 eslint can't use babylon only because ranges which thing is exactly the idea behind babylon-to-espree in the babel-eslint , 3 if eslint use babel-eslint it don't get all of the power of babylon . or okey, it _should_, but there some problems, which i don't want to report, because it may be better to do the effort to pr such plugin. do you want prs here and there for such thing? sorry if something isn't clear, i'm a bit tired. ;
