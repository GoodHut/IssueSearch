 URL : "https://github.com/district0x/name-bazaar/issues/116" TITLE : migration to css grid BODY : explore possibility to move from semantic grid into css grid. if this proves to be feasible on nb, we'll use that for all other districts. the end goal is to separate components code from visual layouting as much as possible. that means, moving layouting into css. i'm not sure how smooth can migration be, but would be great if it can be applied continuously without breaking current layout. so, if you migrate some components, commit it, we'll take a look and test in different browsers and if all good, you'll continue. namebazaar should look exactly same after migration. there seems to be multiple ways of doing css grid, like via grid-template-areas or grid-template-rows, etc. i don't know i'm no expert, so play around it and find best way ;
