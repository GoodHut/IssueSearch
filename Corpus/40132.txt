 URL : "https://github.com/springfox/springfox-grails-integration/issues/6" TITLE : test run fine but... BODY : now that i've taken a look at the test application btw: great approach! , i notice that you test against teh perfect json but don't test that the springfox-grails-integration doesn not produce too much. everything output in addition to your test json is imho garbage and should be avoided.
