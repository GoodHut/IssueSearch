 URL : "https://github.com/yuvipanda/kube-image-puller/issues/2" TITLE : strange behavior on azure BODY : yuvi, i've run into a strange behavior on azure with the prepuller. it just hangs. i was stuck for a few days figuring it out. when i set the prepuller to false all is working again. after i run helm install, it times out and doesn't finish. the proxy pod or the hub pod aren't running, put the puller is running and stuck in this infinite loop. pulling jupyterhub/k8s-singleuser-sample:v0.4 on 0 nodes job pull-k8s-singleuser-sample-v0-4-1509221770 created sh: 0: unknown operand pulled of 0 nodes pulled of 0 nodes sh: 0: unknown operand pulled of 0 nodes sh: 0: unknown operand this is fixed by setting this in the config.yaml. prepuller: enabled: false i haven't experienced this issue on gcp. jason
