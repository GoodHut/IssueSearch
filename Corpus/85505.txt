 URL : "https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install/issues/245" TITLE : feature request - tcp/443 BODY : hi nyr - i’ve been using your script for the last 2 years to spin up multiple vpn servers in minutes that just work. i've also read through and mostly agree with your stance re. the ill-advisability of using tcp on openvpn. however, as the 40+ issues opened on this topic might suggest to you, this is a common use scenario when the only open ports available in a restrictive workplace are http and https and even udp port 53 is blocked as dns is resolved internally. as such, i strongly recommend that you consider at least consider offering the option of using either tcp/443 or udp/1194 with a disclaimer in your script for server/client configurations. that would, at one stroke, make your script “universally useful” for the vast majority of use cases, especially for rookie users who can’t figure out how to modify the configs with proto tcp themselves, and are currently being directed by shills to use the forked “advanced” installs pushing laughable options antivirus!!! besides being remarkably unstable and woefully out of date. just saying... :-
