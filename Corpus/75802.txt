 URL : "https://github.com/quasar/QuasarRAT/issues/614" TITLE : illegal usage of quasar. BODY : hej, i love working on quasar and i would love it too even work more on it but we need something to prevent scriptkiddos to use quasar illegally. don't want potentially go to jail because i contributed to a project i love. we need to start a discussion about this matter. my ideas: . remove the password and keylogger feature and put them in some kind of plugin that doesn't relate to quasar. . show a warning to the user when establishing a connection. don't get me wrong but there are so many people out there that harm other people. software should help people not rob them. if those steps are taken more people would contribute.
