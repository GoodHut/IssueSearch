 URL : "https://github.com/waylan/Python-Markdown/issues/548" TITLE : subclassing an extension? BODY : i'd like to extend an existing python-markdown extension. specifically, i want to create a custom extension which does the same processing as pymdownx.mark https://github.com/facelessuser/pymdown-extensions/blob/master/pymdownx/mark.py but in addition to performing the transformation, it should do some logging. most specifically, i want to write out to an external file all content portions matched by the extension i.e. in this case all ==such text== . could anyone kindly provide a minimal example how i could subclass/inherit from an existing extension and add functionality to it but keeping the original functionality?
