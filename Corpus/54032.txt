 URL : "https://github.com/nielsenramon/chalk/issues/46" TITLE : feature: post previews BODY : howdy, thanks for building this pretty little theme : it would be neat if you could set a number of lines for chalk to preview of a post. in the past i've used the excerpt_separator http://wesleytsai.io/2015/07/06/create-post-previews-for-jekyll-blogs/ on my posts with other themes. do you think this would that be something you could easily add in into the theme? thanks,
