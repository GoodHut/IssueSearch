watsat - h2osoi areas masked where h2osoi stays below saturation we are observing in our regional clm 4.5 model setup, using a custom surface dataset and forcings, that over our simulation period h2osoi often surpasses watsat significantly ~8% in areas with high organic matter and precipitation. we assume that, independently of our inputs, soil moisture should be constrained by watsat at all times. the modeled catchment is the murrumbidgee basin in australia.
