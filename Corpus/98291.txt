 URL : "https://github.com/stanford-ppl/spatial-lang/issues/164" TITLE : init interval optimization BODY : if we have foreach n by 1 { i => a i = a i + 3 } the ii of this loop is going to be 2 because of the sramread and fixadd. but i think it should recognize that there are no iteration dependencies and squash the ii down to 1 since it can issue one body per cycle without a problem
