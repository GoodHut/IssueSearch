 URL : "https://github.com/jbush001/NyuziProcessor/issues/127" TITLE : verilog unit test support BODY : currently, the build structure only creates one verilator executable that simulates the whole design. it might be nice to be able to verilog run unit tests against individual modules. building a verilog simulator is not lightweight. it requires a top level c++ file that runs the simulation, which has a hardcoded name of the top level module. it also generates a bunch of source and object files, which go into an intermediate directory. ideally, there would be some scripts to abstracts this away so it's easy to add new tests for example, it automatically generates the test runner and does everything in a temp directory . it might be desirable to put unit tests in the module files they validate, with an ifdef so they aren't compiled during normal synthesis or simulation.
