BODY : do we need to add epic games and twitch? this lancache has them: https://blog.yolocation.pro/index.php/2016/02/03/how-to-install-lancache-on-debian/ i believe with twitch, if more than a few people are watching the same stream, it will become one download from the internet. however, if i remember when i tried this, it broke being a streamer upload . so we might have to research if we can fix that.
