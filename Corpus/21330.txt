 URL : "https://github.com/dotnet-state-machine/stateless/issues/197" TITLE : expose state graph BODY : hi, we use todotgraph for debugging purposes, but we'd like to get the list of states between two states programmatically and parsing the output of todotgraph seems a bit overkill . would it make sense to have a method that exposes the graph in a code-friendly manner ? if so we'd happily make a pr for it . thanks, k√©vin
