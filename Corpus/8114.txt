 URL : "https://github.com/bachvudao/tadpole-catcher/issues/2" TITLE : move to windows BODY : move the code to be windows compatible. this change will enable the synergy with google photo backup as that is strictly just windows right now. the app can download to a single folder and google photo will handle the backup of that folder. a few issues pop up: 1. python 3: not strictly required but might as well. 1. the use of xfvb is no longer valid. this means the browser window will show up when the script runs. 1. the use of magic lib is difficult to resolve. while it is entirely possible to use the magic library in windows, a far easier solution is to rely on the content type back from the http response.
