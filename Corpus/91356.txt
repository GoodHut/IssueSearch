 URL : "https://github.com/sacmwg/draft-ietf-sacm-terminology/issues/53" TITLE : thoughts on sacm function BODY : i'm struggling with this term because by my read it's attempting to narrow a common definition of function in computer science terms to something that reads more like the description of capability . a capability is the extent of something's ability, and, for example, the following reads more like the description of a capability than a function: for example, a sacm function with interfaces on the control plane can provide a brokering function to other sacm components. would we be better off striking this term and relying on capability instead?
