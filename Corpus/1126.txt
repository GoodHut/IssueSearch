 URL : "https://github.com/msruback/MoNet2/issues/31" TITLE : gear id bug BODY : currently users are notified of gear they did not request to be notified of. this is due to gear of different kinds sharing ids. this issue reaches beyond just the notifications, as gear is not currently being stored, and this will cause issues in displaying gear in battle info and storing gear in the closet. the solution is pretty simple, split the gear table into three separate tables, head , clothes , and gear . this will require edits to the closet table to hold a reference to the kind of gear in the table, as well as minimal changes to the battlemanager. the impact to data already stored in the database is non-existent. there will be temporary issues of gear seen in battles not being present in the related table, but that should resolve itself quickly, as battles and the shop inserts gear that was missing.
