 URL : "https://github.com/abhijithanilkumar/ns-3-AppStore/issues/32" TITLE : ordering of ns-releases BODY : i added a couple of past releases 3.22 and then 3.26 and now the pull-down menu shows '3.27' followed by '3.22' followed by '3.26'; can these be reordered? can the default be to insert a new ns-3 release at the top of the menu bar? similarly, i have a question about how we organize tags as the tag list grows; we may want to reorder.
