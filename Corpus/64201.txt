 URL : "https://github.com/Pterodactyl/Panel/issues/358" TITLE : flaw in password resets BODY : when going to reset a password, if you enter an email address that doesn't exist, it will tell you straight up that there is no record of the account. in my opinion, this is a security flaw since a malicious user can continue to enter email addresses until they find one that actually resets. if they're determined enough, they can then go after that email address to try and hack into it and obtain access. i know it sounds ridiculous, especially for a small project like this, but i think the panel should simply say something like if this user account exists, password reset instructions will be emailed to this address. instead. this way, the user has no idea whether the account exists or not.
