 URL : "https://github.com/marcguetg/h5particle/issues/1" TITLE : one standard or two? BODY : my thought is that there should be one standard which is a modification of the existing openpmd standard. this new standard would be version 2 to keep things backwards compatible. i think this is preferable to having two standards which would put more work on program maintainers. thoughts?
