 URL : "https://github.com/AlessandroYorba/Alduin/issues/23" TITLE : black and white BODY : hi, excellent colorscheme. i've been trying to get it installed and i'm having some trouble. i have installed many other colorschemes before successfully. i placed the alduin.vim file in my .vim/colors directory, but when i select it as the default theme, i get white text on my dark background. i've used other 256 colorschemes before, and i tested my terminal color output just to be sure. does alduin.vim have a dependency on another file, by chance? is this something that you've dealt with before?
