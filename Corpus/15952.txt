 URL : "https://github.com/coffeescript6/discuss/issues/82" TITLE : getters / setters BODY : i have been following the discussions on getters/setters and i totally understand and concur with the reasoning behind not allowing the standard es6 syntax in cs2. however, the solution given in the draft manual is, imo, both unclear and against the general philosophy of cs which is to make things less verbose and easier to use. i am constantly pushing cs as a more concise way of writing js and having to write the following is simply counter-intuitive. coffeescript class screen width: 1200 ratio: 16/9 object.defineproperty @, 'height', get: -> this.width / this.ratio set: val -> this.width = val / this.ratio what about introducing a new syntax? something on the lines of: coffeescript class screen width: 1200 ratio: 16/9 |get| width: -> this.width / this.ratio |set| width: val -> this.width = val / this.ratio thoughts?
