 URL : "https://github.com/NucleusPowered/Nucleus/issues/683" TITLE : invsee slot count BODY : i'm not sure this is something you can fix on your end, but i'd like to ask. i'm getting an ugly invalid slot count of 41 for container net.minecraft.inventory.containerchest@3b15214e with inventory net.minecraft.entity.player.inventoryplayer@1269ec0a - most api inventory methods will not be supported with /invsee on most of my players with skyfactory 3. i wasn't able to hone in on what's causing the issue, but my suspicion is baubles, or something similar. any ideas how to get around this?
