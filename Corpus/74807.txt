 URL : "https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi/issues/1720" TITLE : finer control of gpu use BODY : continuing here from https://groups.google.com/d/topic/kaldi-help/pjs9itjiszc/discussion. basically, scripts like steps/nnet3/train_rnn.py which involve computing posteriors and updating priors use the same run_opts as the training steps. i do not know how beneficial gpu would be in general for this step, but on a single gpu machine it just does not work--perhaps due to the cuda 8 bug see 1487 ? i see a few options: 1. do nothing. nvidia will fix it if that's what i think it is . 2. disable gpu for the prior update step entirely. 3. add an option to the nnet3/train_ .py scripts, --use_gpu.prior overriding --use_gpu for this step what should i do with this?
