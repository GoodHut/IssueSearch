 URL : "https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-nano/issues/550" TITLE : issues with logging in BODY : expected behaviour we should be able to login with any account, no matter if it's a delegate or not, new or without the history of transactions. actual behaviour if the account belongs to a delegate or has no history the login fails. apparently it's a race condition issue. steps to reproduce try logging in with different account.
