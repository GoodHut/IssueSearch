 URL : "https://github.com/sntran/ueberauth_auth0/issues/13" TITLE : nil value for uid_field BODY : i tried implementing the module as part of an overall ueberauth, guardian & canary implementation. but i was getting an error on the callback indicating: nil given for :uid. comparison with nil is forbidden as it is unsafe. instead write a query with is_nil/1, for example: is_nil s.uid the error appears to be arising due to the fact that line 21 of ueberauth_auth0/lib/ueberauth/strategy/auth0.ex is set as follows: uid_field: :user_id . however, i don't think that user_id is set anywhere in the strategy or a value available from auth0. i've set it as follows instead: uid_field: :email , which seems to resolve this issue. how did you work around this @sntran? has anyone else encountered the issue? i'll submit a pr for the above in case it's of use. btw, i'm running elixir 1.5 and phoenix 1.3.
