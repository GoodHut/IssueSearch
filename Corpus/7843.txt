 URL : "https://github.com/engram-design/FeedMe/issues/260" TITLE : json import bug BODY : yo josh ðŸ˜Ž converting a little side project to craft and ran across this bug ? ... json: { items : { title : entry 1 }, { title : entry 2 } } if i don't specify items as the primary element when setting up the feed, the feed import task will fail with no errors logged. however, if i turn on dev mode and run the debug mode, i'll get craft exception: >{ title : title is invalid. } i think this refers to fm's field mapping, which is saved as: >{ title : items\\/title , ... for whatever reason, it doesn't seem to like the escaped /. setting the primary element means fm saves the mapping as just: > { title : title , ... and that works. cheers! :
