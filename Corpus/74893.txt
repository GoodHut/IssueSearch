 URL : "https://github.com/iconnect/regex/issues/145" TITLE : fix pcre with utf-8 data BODY : regex-pcre has never worked with utf8 data due to 141 and it was never guaranteed http://hackage.haskell.org/package/regex-pcre-0.94.4/docs/text-regex-pcre.html . currently it is not working on windows at least on appveyor and the windows utf-8/pcre tests have been suspended. the current method of fixing up the offsets in regex is hacky and inefficient.
