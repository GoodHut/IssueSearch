 URL : "https://github.com/mcamara/laravel-localization/issues/481" TITLE : post request redirection BODY : if it's a post request and without a locale in the url, it's redirected with a locale in the url, but as it will be converted into a get request, it causes method not allowed exception. i think there is no point in redirecting post request so it is better to check and redirect only if it's a get request, isn't it?
