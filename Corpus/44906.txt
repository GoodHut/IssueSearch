 URL : "https://github.com/Bionus/imgbrd-grabber/issues/1157" TITLE : gelbooru - no results BODY : what steps will reproduce the problem? when ever i try doing anything with the source gelbooru i automatically get back no result , yet other sources work fine. i think this started happening after the recent update. i tried tweaking the infos on the login tab but it didn't help, maybe i'm an idiot and just don't know how to put it back to default within this tab. what is the expected behavior? what do you get instead? how often does this problem occur? on which sources? happens all the time, with gelbooru source. what version of the program are you using? on what operating system? i'm using version 5.5.2, on windows 10. please provide any additional information below
