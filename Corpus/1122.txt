 URL : "https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/VitaShell/issues/226" TITLE : ftp on vita BODY : whenever i connect my psvita to power but it is already charged so it does not except power and than i turn on ftp through vitashell but instead of the usual message it says usb connected and when i hit cancel it comes up with an error and all data is then corrupted : . this is very annoying because i have to reset system and re-transfer all my stuff. also in the settings i have it set to start ftp when select is pressed.
