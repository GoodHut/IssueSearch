 URL : "https://github.com/este/este/issues/1411" TITLE : css in js reloaded BODY : just an idea, but i think we can use inline styles where they are supported, and custom components for stuff like media queries. because este is using own set of components, we can - use mouseenter and mouseleave for anchor where we need underline - custom placeholder for textinput component - etc. almost nothing needs to be prefixed http://shouldiprefix.com/ but because inline styles can't have multiple values, we need isomorphic browser detection and have useragentprovider based on client and server user agent string. let's see.
