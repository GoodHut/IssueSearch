 URL : "https://github.com/kanryu/quickviewer/issues/57" TITLE : may be a random qt bug? BODY : while testing with only fit to window on i can crash qv by simply dragging the right side and shaking it left and right quickly several times like a dog with a stick, agreed that's not normal for a grown-up user but it is a constant fail windows 7x64 running 32bit o r64bit qv 1.06 with a standard jpeg many other files in directory so may be a background file loading but if i don't shake the border the application stays stable
