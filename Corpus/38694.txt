 URL : "https://github.com/pugjs/pug/issues/2686" TITLE : pug linker - plugins BODY : i'm not that confident what a plugin api for the linker should look like, but my current thinking is to have the following hooks: 1. pre-link gets given asts that are about to be linked 2. pre-extend gets given the parent ast and the child ast before any blocks have been resolved 3. extend gets given the parent ast and child ast before any blocks have been resolved, but then skips built in block resolving 4. post-extend gets given the parent ast and the child ast after blocks have been resolved 5. pre-include gets include node before yield has been applied 6. include gets include node before yield has been applied, but skips applying yield 7. post-include gets include after yield has been applied 8. post-link gets given asts after all other linking is done we should handle raw/filtered includes somewhere else so they don't feature in this proposed plugin api.
