 URL : "https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/3867" TITLE : missing potion hocks BODY : we have currently no events firing on adding/changing potion effect to a living entity, i think this should be changed. i suggest a event for: - entitylivingbase.onnewpotioneffect - entitylivingbase.onchangedpotioneffect - entitylivingbase.ispotionapplicable - entitylivingbase.onfinishedpotioneffect bacause i want to manipulate the effects of the player and a tickhandler whould be a bit overkill.
