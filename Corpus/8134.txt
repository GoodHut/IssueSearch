 URL : "https://github.com/mapleforest/HaploMerger2/issues/2" TITLE : n50 of assembly BODY : hi, as mentioned in the manual, haplomerger2 is not suitable to work on the assemblies with a scaffold n50 size <50kb; it barely works when the scaffold 100kb>n50>50kb; it works better when the scaffold n50>100kb; and it works much better when scaffold n50>150kb. . i want to know how do you lead to this conclusion? as far as i know, n50 is just one aspect of assembly quality and when comparing n50, genome size is also important. an assembly with n50=50kb of a larger genome e.g. 3gb will be more fragmented than the assembly with n50=50kb of a smaller genome e.g. 300mb . so for different genome sizes, n50=50kb means different qualities and are those not a fair standard. best, danshu
