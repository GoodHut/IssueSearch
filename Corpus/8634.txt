 URL : "https://github.com/michellab/Sire/issues/140" TITLE : push for 2017.1 BODY : notionally friday is the close of pull requests deadline for the 2017.1 release although i am willing to be a little fuzzy with this deadline if needed - i.e. pushing back to the middle of next week . so far, 2017.1 will include: bug fixes in compilation to enable code to compile on os x bug fixes in the shared memory system so that sire will scale to large number of cores. 2016.3 and less all contain serious race conditions that cause crashes or memory corruption when the code is run in parallel. this is fixed in new_parser, and will cause a full rebuild when this is merged back into devel. new parallel parser framework, with a new parallel amber parser. this is much faster, and gives more control over parsing, and will support full reading and writing of files in lots of different file formats. this is also in new_parser. exposure of the moleculeinfodata class to users via the new moleculeinfo class. this will make it easier to write code that queries and works with the underlying molecule/atom layout. this is also in new_parser. bugfixes in the calculation of free energy components for waterswap, ligandswap and proteinswap general bug fixes and performance optimisations, e.g. fix for compile_sire.sh --install xxx is there anything else that is likely to be merged?
