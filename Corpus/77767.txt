 URL : "https://github.com/BoxFactura/pulltorefresh.js/issues/21" TITLE : npm module has no export BODY : it looks like in the upgrade to 0.14 the npm module no longer has an export in it, but instead just defines a variable: https://github.com/boxfactura/pulltorefresh.js/commit/bc3adb3febbb611862bcddf7c9edb34fc1227a78 diff-43757bd0eb07f11dd4e8e579643e30eb consequently if i attempt to import the module doing something like this: let ptrjs = require 'pulltorefreshjs' ; ptrjs will be undefined.
