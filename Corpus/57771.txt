 URL : "https://github.com/valllabh/jquery.currency.converter/issues/1" TITLE : remember user's option BODY : this isn't so much an issue as a request, i like your plugin and i am currently using it on my client's website but i am just wondering would you be able to make it that instead of resetting to the first option when the page is reloaded, is there a way to make it remember the user's selection and keep it on their selection when the page is reloaded or when you leave the page and come back to it. i tried to do this by using localstorage and i was only able to make it work for the select and it's options, but i was unable to make it work for the target tag where it appends the converted currency html. any help would be greatly appreciated. thank you
