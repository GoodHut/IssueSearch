 URL : "https://github.com/jasonrohrer/OneLife/issues/4" TITLE : segfault on local system BODY : when the client uses echo 1 > autologin.ini pointed at a local server with no saved credentials , the client segfaults. when autologin is disabled and you enter some fake email/key the game loads without issue. - tested on ubuntu linux - test on other os - are we reading a file that doesn't exist? - are we reading a 0-length buffer where the credentials should be? - are we writing to an uninitialized buffer?
