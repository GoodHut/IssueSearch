 URL : "https://github.com/pluf/spa/issues/11" TITLE : new resource negotiation BODY : change resource negotiation to following method: we assume first part of path in request is spa name and remain parts determine a state or resource of that spa. if path ends with an extension a dot and a word after that we assume request path is a file resource and else it is an internal state. if no file found we return a not found error. for all internal state we return main file for example index.html or main.html of spa. if no spa found with first part of path we assume requested resource is belong to default spa. so above scenario will be repeat for default tenant.
