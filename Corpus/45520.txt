 URL : "https://github.com/msmead/SieveOfEratosthenes/issues/1" TITLE : implement basic sieve BODY : there a couple of different solutions here. i am going to make the assumption that responsible memory consumption is okay and that the problem can fit in memory. given this, keeping an array mask that tracks if a number is prime or not would meet our requirements. - figure out how we want to store the mask. - figure out efficient way to iterate and check if a number is prime. - abstract some of the lower level operations. since i am making the assumption that the problem can fit in memory, readability is a high priority.
