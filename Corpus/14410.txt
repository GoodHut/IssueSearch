 URL : "https://github.com/osTicket/osTicket/issues/3595" TITLE : agent ticket view BODY : is it possible to allow staff search and view tickets but they should not be able to see all their department tickets in open tickets following are the things what i propose to do when limit access to assigned tickets is checked for the agent - staff should be able to see tickets assigned to them only. - staff should be able to search ticket by number, organisation or email id or other parameter for search. - reason: when client call, they may ask to talk to some other agent but to buy time they may ask their ticket id or other details to search their ticket and reply if required after claiming the ticket. - staff should not be able to reply on the ticket unless they claim the ticket. - locked tickets must not be transferred to claiming staff
