 URL : "https://github.com/nathanmac/Parser/issues/43" TITLE : parsing xml example BODY : is it possible to just get a complete example of parsing xml for a specific key using the facade? currently i'm able to convert the whole xml structure into an array using $xml = parser::xml $response ; however is there a way to specific pull keys? using the documentation it would be something like parser::get 'key', 'default value' ; but i don't know how to tie it all together. thanks
