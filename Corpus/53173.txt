 URL : "https://github.com/bruderstein/npppm3/issues/3" TITLE : dependencies component BODY : a plugin can have dependencies on other plugins. in the plugin editor there is a dependenciesinput component, but it just renders a todo marker currently. this should be a react-select https://github.com/jedwatson/react-select multi-tag mode component, populated with the list of plugins available with the pluginlist reducer/selector . we may need to fetch the list if it's not available, so check for a null and call the fetchpluginlist action if it's null in the contructor of the dependenciesinput component. the resulting shape in the reducer should be a list of plugin ids and names. immutable.list immutable.map { id: '5008b4c4-8998-4dd0-ac1e-fa4233f38fd0 , name: npptidy } it is probably set with just a install_step_field_changed action, setting the dependencies to the new immutable list.
