 URL : "https://github.com/JuliaParallel/Dagger.jl/issues/50" TITLE : get rid of partitions BODY : as development has progressed it is no longer clear why partition is needed as an abstraction. one can just create different domainsplit structures and pass it to a single distribute generic function to do the distribution. the only use however seemed to be dispatching on base function like rand zeros etc. we can switch to dispatching on chunks 10, 10 or something like that.
