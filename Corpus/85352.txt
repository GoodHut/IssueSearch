 URL : "https://github.com/idaholab/moose/issues/9128" TITLE : exodusreader can segfault BODY : this seems to be caused when the chigger exodusreader is reading a file while moose is writing to the file. the internals of vtk gets confused and seg faults. this seems to primarily happen when adaptivity is used. an example is modules/phase_field/examples/grain_growth/grain_growth_2d_graintracker.i run with something like mpirun -n 20 ../../../combined/combined-opt -i grain_growth_2d_graintracker.i and then run this script in a seperate terminal provided by @aeslaughter !/usr/bin/env python import chigger filename = 'grain_growth_2d_graintracker_out.e' reader = chigger.exodus.exodusreader filename result = chigger.exodus.exodusresult reader, edges=true window = chigger.renderwindow result window.start timer=chigger.base.chiggertimer window, duration=100 it will eventually seg fault.
