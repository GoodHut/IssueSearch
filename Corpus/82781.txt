 URL : "https://github.com/kyamagu/mexopencv/issues/359" TITLE : aruco and ximgproc errors BODY : hi it appears that aruco is not in opencv 3.3.0 world version. therefore, i encountered an error: aruco.hpp no such file or directoy. to resolve this, i had to delete aruco from include and src folders in opencv_contrib.3.3.0. once again at: fasthoughtransform.cpp path_to_root_folder\mexopencv-master\opencv_contrib\src\+cv\fasthoughtransform.cpp 9 : fatal error c1083: cannot open include file: 'opencv2/ximgproc.hpp': no such file or directory don't know how to solve this. perhaps some path issue somewhere
