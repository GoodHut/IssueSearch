 URL : "https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools/issues/907" TITLE : command line aliases BODY : there is a new debug command which launches binaries under a debugger in an automated fashion, including those of foreign architectures. it's really neat! we ship a pwn binary which is the entry point for all of these tools, as of 3.0 or so. we should support aliases so that one can not only invoke pwn debug but also pwn dbg , which is a cheeky reference to my other project, pwndbg.
