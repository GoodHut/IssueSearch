 URL : "https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneyeos/issues/742" TITLE : feature request - audio BODY : would it be possible to add the capability to select, and listen to, an audio source from the web interface? it would be nice to listen in on either a microphone embedded in a camera, such as a cheap play station eye, or from a stand alone microphone. thanks for your help.
