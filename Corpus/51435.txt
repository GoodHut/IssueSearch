 URL : "https://github.com/bubkoo/hexo-toc/issues/16" TITLE : anchor symbol problems BODY : double quotes are added to anchor symbol, and i think it is not intended. while html bookmark on the symbol is not working properly, for a missing hashtag in the href. say, > heading becomes > heading and, click on the anchor symbol, link href becomes /heading , which is supposed to be / heading , making browser goes to 404 page. after rolling back to v1.0.4, everything works fine. thanks!
