 URL : "https://github.com/letscontrolit/ESPEasy/issues/558" TITLE : wpa krack vulnerability BODY : according to this forum post https://www.letscontrolit.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=3673 , it should be quite easy to update to apply a patch for the wpa krack vulnerability. see also: https://github.com/esp8266/arduino/issues/3725 given that these boards should not be connected to the internet, it may be less of an issue?????? is it too much of an issue to release it with 2.0.0? i will also look into it, to see how much impact it may have and perhaps create a pull request.
