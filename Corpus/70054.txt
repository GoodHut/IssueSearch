 URL : "https://github.com/yarnpkg/website/issues/339" TITLE : update self-update page BODY : given this issue here https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/1139 and in particular this comment https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/1139 issuecomment-268229087 it'd be nice to have some kind of hint that self-update is gone until further notice. not being aware of its removal, it was not trivial to track down what was going wrong i assumed i had botched something up myself , and it's actively misleading that the website currently shows the presence of the command - https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/self-update. even a note, this is in active development, see <github issue> or something providing any information would go a long way.
