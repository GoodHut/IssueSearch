 URL : "https://github.com/IdentityModel/oidc-client-js/issues/316" TITLE : pre init oidc-client BODY : hi guys i have a small question. actually i have two services on www.service.com and id.service.com. on id identityserver4 is running. the website on www is spa. when loading the www page at the very beginning i am initializing oidc-client which gets me user authorization state. this of course takes some time which i want to avoid to boost inital time to interactive. i was now thinking about setting the idsrv / cookie auth cookie domain to .service.com so that i can, without roundtrip, on initial page load determine if the user has valid authentication. a do i forget some serious security or other issue where and b if not, how can i then initially set up oidc-client using the already known data so that it can start working seamlessly without having to do that initial roundtrip? thanks for any hints! best regards, reinhard
