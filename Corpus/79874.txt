 URL : "https://github.com/yamboo-efi/plugin.video.flix2kodi/issues/1" TITLE : suggestions doesn't work BODY : first of all, i wanna thanks yamboo-efi for keeping this plugin alive. so far the plugin works o.k. for me play the movies even using custom playback.sh but i cannot make it to read my list . i can access the movies and tv menus and in both of them check the viewing activity. since there i can see the movies i watched recently i can conclude it is not a login/ credentials problem. but when i click in the suggestion menu the my list menu is inside it i get the following error: 10:16:14.436 t:140410445772544 error: exception thrown pythontocppexception : -->python callback/script returned the following error<-- - note: ignoring this can lead to memory leaks! error type: <type 'exceptions.valueerror'> error contents: lolomos not found in: {} traceback most recent call last : file /home/xbmc/.kodi/addons/plugin.video.flix2kodi/addon.py , line 95, in <module> handle_request file /home/xbmc/.kodi/addons/plugin.video.flix2kodi/addon.py , line 37, in handle_request general.main video_type file /home/xbmc/.kodi/addons/plugin.video.flix2kodi/resources/general.py , line 46, in main add_dynamic_lists file /home/xbmc/.kodi/addons/plugin.video.flix2kodi/resources/general.py , line 67, in add_dynamic_lists mylist_id, lists = lolomos.read_lists ret, root_list file /home/xbmc/.kodi/addons/plugin.video.flix2kodi/resources/path_evaluator/types/lolomos.py , line 16, in read_lists llms = child 'lolomos', jsn file /home/xbmc/.kodi/addons/plugin.video.flix2kodi/resources/path_evaluator/__init__.py , line 130, in child raise valueerror str chld +' not found in: '+str jsn valueerror: lolomos not found in: {} -->end of python script error report<-- and the suggestions menu is not opened. i'm using kodibuntu ubuntu 14.04.5 lts, trusty and kodi 17.1. is there any way to solve this problem or to reach the my list menu? many thanks.
