 URL : "https://github.com/hylang/hy/issues/1357" TITLE : improving irc experience BODY : two ideas here. first, our readme points to the hy channel on freenode. i see new users on there asking for help pretty frequently. but i've occasionally been frustrated when someone asks an easy question and then logs off before i see it. i can't realistically answer everything instantly, even if i enable alerts. sometimes i'm busy with other things. sometimes they're in a distant timezone and i'm asleep. we could mention in the readme that if nobody's talking on the channel that you should wait in the channel about a day for a response. better yet, we could set up a server message in the channel itself explaining this. but i don't know who the admin for the channel is. second, it would be nice if we could evaluate code snippets to demonstrate things to the new users. this could be done with a bot. i noticed we have one of those https://github.com/hylang/hygdrop, but nobody's touched it in years, and we don't seem to have any active bots watching the channel. just omghy that occasionally pops in and out. once we demonstrate this, users could private message the bot and try things for themselves. it would be nice if the bot could optionally use both the latest master or the latest stable, depending on so we could demonstrate appropriate code depending on which version the user is asking about. i don't know if github has a way to push updates like that, but it might have to be set up here in this repo. otherwise, the bot could check for updates once a day or something. we'd naturally want to sandbox it and set output length limits to prevent abuse, and timeouts to deal with infinite loops. and there should be a command to reset it. i propose naming the new bot cuddles . ðŸ¦‘
