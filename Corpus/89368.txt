 URL : "https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/issues/741" TITLE : proportional font support BODY : when rendered with a proportional/variable-pitch font, lines in the company completion display do not align because they're dependent on the font width being consistent monospace . in proportional fonts break company overlays https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/35891/proportional-font-breaks-company-overlays , it is suggested that ad-hoc frames should be used for popups, which may need to be an internal change in emacs. would a feature like this be possible, and if not, what can we do to help get this in emacs core?
