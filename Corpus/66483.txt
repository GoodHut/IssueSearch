 URL : "https://github.com/dino/dino/issues/235" TITLE : move to gnetworkmonitor BODY : dino currently talk to networkmanager over dbus to know the state of the network. that doesn't work in a flatpak sandbox by default though, because flatpak filters dbus communications and only allows a very small set of things to pass which are known to be safe . gio provides an api to know the state of the network and be notified of changes via a signal : gnetworkmonitor https://developer.gnome.org/gio/stable/gnetworkmonitor.html . and gnetworkmonitor works both inside a flatpak sandbox, and in traditional builds. in flatpak it uses what we call a portal , which are the clean, safe way to let apps exit their sandbox
