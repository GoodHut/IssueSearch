 URL : "https://github.com/bavc/qctools/issues/365" TITLE : qcli -h output BODY : the qcli -h is currently quite ugly on a standard terminal window. i suggest e.g. qcli 0.8.1, 2017-04-20 17:15:11, copyright c 2013-2017 bavc usage: qcli -i <qctools-input> -o <qctools-output> -i <input file> specifies absolute path of input file, including extension. -o <output file> specifies output file path, including extension. if no output file is declared, qctools will create an output named after the input file, suffixed with .qctools.xml.gz . -f the filters used in qcli may be declared via the qctools-gui see the preferences panel . available filters: signalstats cropdetect psnr ebur128 aphasemeter astats ssim idet -y force creation of <qctools-report> even if it already exists. signal server flags: -u upload to signal server if <qctools-report> not exists here -uf force upload <qctools-report> to signalserver even if file already exists -c <qctools-report> check if uploaded to signal server usage example: qcli -i file.mkv generates qctools file in same directory named file.mkv.qctools.xml.gz qcli -i file.mkv -o report.xml.gz generates qctools file in same directory named report.xml.gz qcli -i file.mkv -u generate stats from file.mkv and upload to signal server if stats wasn't uploaded previously qcli -i file.mkv -uf generate stats from file.mkv and upload to signal server unconditionally qcli -i file.mkv.qctools.xml.gzip -u upload stats to signal server if stats wasn't uploaded qcli -i file.mkv.qctools.xml.gzip -uf upload stats to signal server unconditionally qcli -c file.mkv.qctools.xml.gzip checks if such a file exists on signal server i.e. line breaks at 80 chars and indent 4 or 2 .
