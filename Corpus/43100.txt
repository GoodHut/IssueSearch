 URL : "https://github.com/chabermacher/traveller-project/issues/43" TITLE : cleanup app structure BODY : while i don't think we will be 'graded' on this, we should coordinate a way to organize the app's code in a logical way that is consistent across modules. i like the class approach because they're clean and easier to read than object literals. event listeners i think should be moved to the main app.js file, which should all be wrapped in jquery's document.ready so nothing can or will happen until the page is fully loaded.
