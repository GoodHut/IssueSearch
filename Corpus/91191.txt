 URL : "https://github.com/w3c/input-events/issues/55" TITLE : tag review for inputevent BODY : blink's shipping process requires a tag review https://github.com/w3ctag/spec-reviews/issues for the spec and it seems that inputevent doesn't already have one. i'm not so sure about the process but 1. should i go ahead and file a request, or 2. the spec author @johanneswilm should be the person to file the request?
