 URL : "https://github.com/bugsnag/depercolator/issues/11" TITLE : use local eslint BODY : would be good if it could first check for eslint in the current project. the problem with global eslint is that when you'll call depercolator from a project's folder that has an eslint configuration it will complain about missing eslint plugins. i could try making a pr if you think it's useful.
