 URL : "https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-spell-latex/issues/23" TITLE : ignore some files BODY : thanks for this fantastic package! is it possible to ignore spell check on some certain files. i don't want spell check on my .bib file since this is huge and has many strange names which are highlighted. it could also be nice to remove spell check for preamble.tex if such a file is used, but this is not a main concern.
