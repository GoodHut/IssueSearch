 URL : "https://github.com/viebel/klipse/issues/300" TITLE : c++ typing error BODY : i was attempting to demonstrate c++ type errors that happen at compile time in a demonstration post using klipse, however the typing error seemed to happen at run-time instead of parsing/compilation time as prior lines of code were run and output information before the typing error was hit, which completely destroyed my argument for c++ that catching type errors at compile-time prior to run-time helped prevent classes of errors before the code is executed. ^.^;
