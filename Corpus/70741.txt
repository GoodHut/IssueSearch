 URL : "https://github.com/statedecoded/statedecoded/issues/690" TITLE : xml output is incorrect BODY : it looks like sections are being garbled pretty bad. this is since the export refactor and replacing simplexml, so there's lots here to look at. i think the old method of just assuming that the law will nicely structure itself into well-formatted xml is no longer ideal, i think a more manual approach would be useful here to account for all the changes recently.
