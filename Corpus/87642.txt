 URL : "https://github.com/boto/botocore/issues/1128" TITLE : lower dateutil dependency BODY : on some systems, such as el7, dateutil 2.1 is not present, but dateutil 1.4 is present. we have botocore running on such systems by patching the requirement http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/python-botocore.git/tree/botocore-1.4.52-fix_dateutil_version.patch . this has no side effects, as far as we saw, so i think it should be done in the upstream version as well.
