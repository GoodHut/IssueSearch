 URL : "https://github.com/savonarola/smppsend/issues/6" TITLE : show application version BODY : i would like to be able to get app version from a compiled binary because there are a lot of hosts in our production environment and i'm never sure if the script i'm running is up to date. i could try making a pr for this feature if you don't mind. is smppsend --version elixir-ish enough way of implementing this?
