BODY : recently twitch updated it's layout.. and now there's a purple bar at the top.. is it possible to get a way to set it to a desired color? it should be split in 3 different sections. i was able to edit the color via inspect mode and changing the hex to whatever color i wanted. so i thought this should be doable.
