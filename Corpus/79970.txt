 URL : "https://github.com/kenperkins/winston-papertrail/issues/74" TITLE : support for winston 3.0? BODY : winston 3.0 is going to be released soon. it has some breaking changes for transports which makes winston-papertrail incompatible. for example, log is now called with a single info object containing message, level instead of a few separate variables. @kenperkins or @troy would you be so kind to adjust the plugin for the new winston version?
