 URL : "https://github.com/OpenRoberta/robertalab/issues/550" TITLE : sim world editor BODY : my first question was how to generate an obstacle on my own sim ground for ev3 or nxt. the answer was: up to now there is no posibility. that s the background why i start this issue. my idea is a complete sim world development environment. the start is a background image. the size should be presetted and the scale to a wallpaper should be defined. under these conditions parallel to the simulation the background image can be printed or painted to build a real mindstorms world. the environment shoud have: - obstacel block 3 dimension size on which the ultrasonic sensor and the touch sensor can react. if wanted a block should be movable perhaps by a fork lifter - sound block on which the microfon can react as well related to the loudness as to a sound frequencies or melody detection - light block on which the light- and color-sensors can react for example: fires at the port of a habour or the flags at ski slalom . etc. ...... this sounds like a lot of work, but if it is possible to combine roberta-lab with greenfoot it might be possible to do this with students. iÂ´m awaiting your comments. yogibaer2
