 URL : "https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-pc/issues/1236" TITLE : legacy error handling BODY : mostly editorial issue https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/archives/20170515/webrtc.html error-handling talks about legacy extension error handling. this is somewhat separate from https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/archives/20170515/webrtc.html legacy-interface-extensions and should probably be moved there. it also says > legacy-methods may only throw exceptions but the legacy description of the legacy method never mentions they throw.
