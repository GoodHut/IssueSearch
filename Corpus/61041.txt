 URL : "https://github.com/paulovap/qtpdfium/issues/4" TITLE : add text extraction api BODY : hi this project is great for rendering so far, but it would be really nice to be able to access some text extraction api. for instance, being able to extract the text at a specific location, or every text element of a page. nb: if i find enough spare time, i'll try to work on this, but i can't promise anything
