 URL : "https://github.com/linuxmint/nemo/issues/1586" TITLE : ambiance theme broken BODY : nemo version: 3.4.7 is issue with desktop or windowed nemo? windowed nemo distribution - ubuntu 16.04.3 nvidia gtx-1070 using nvidia drivers v384.59 from ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa 64 bit issue the sidebar is displaying blank sections on the top or bottom. depending on where the scroll bar is, this can be made more obvious when scrolling. this gif shows the blank section, both at the top and/or bottom, depending on the scrolling. i've also added a gif that shows when you try to keep scrolling past the end. ! nemo_error_2 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1280530/29477458-84026dfe-8436-11e7-96f2-82ea7545ad02.gif ! nemo_error https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1280530/29477320-f471b9ec-8435-11e7-9490-53bbd579b50b.gif on previous versions, there was no blank square. steps to reproduce it should be visible immediately, but scrolling makes it more obvious here's a gif of how it looks when scrolling. expected behaviour the blank areas shouldn't be there other information i think something similar is happening with other themes, as reported in issue 1582 but that issue was closed since the blame was passed to the arc theme instead of nemo itself. the default ambiance theme hasn't been updated, only nemo, so nemo is the one that broke it.
