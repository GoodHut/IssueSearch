 URL : "https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-codegen/issues/154" TITLE : generating flow types BODY : following the examples laid out in the docs, the best practice it seems to put the query with the component, which makes sense to me. at the same time, if i want to generate flow types, it asks for .graphql files, which means i have to separate out the query to its own files and name them .graphql. my question is, how do i put the query with the react component and then generate the flow types? thank you
