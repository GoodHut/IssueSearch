 URL : "https://github.com/dwyl/github-backup/issues/1" TITLE : why? what? how? BODY : this repo was born out of the need identified in: https://github.com/dwyl/github-reference/issues/15 why? as a person who uses github as their _single-sourc-of-truth_ i need a backup of github issues so that i can work offline . _either when i have no network or gh is down _ what? backup github issues. + a script that lets you login to github using oauth + use github rest api to retrieve all issues + store issues as flat files in subdirectories corresponding to the github url e.g: if the issue is dwyl/github-reference/issues/15 store it as dwyl/github-reference/issues/15.json + it does not need to scale it just needs to work. read: http://paulgraham.com/ds.html note: initially we do not need a web-ui to let people backup their issues, but later we could build ui to make it more useable. how? i have a _strong_ preference for using elixir for this because we are transitioning _all_ our projects to elixir, but given that this script does not require parallelism/concurrency it's ok to write it in which ever language you are most comfortable using.
