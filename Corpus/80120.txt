 URL : "https://github.com/vatlab/SOS/issues/363" TITLE : target with signature... BODY : right now the rule for auxiliary step is to ignore the step as long as the target exists. i am wondering if we should be more advanced than this, for example, 1. if no step is generating the target, assuming ok. 2. if a step is generating the target, check the signature and see if the step or input files have been changed, if so, rerun the auxiliary step to regenerate the target.
