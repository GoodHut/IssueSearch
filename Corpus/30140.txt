 URL : "https://github.com/jomo/tld_checker/issues/1" TITLE : not working anymore BODY : hi, thanks for sharing the script. unfortunately, it's not working, tried on ubuntu 17.10 and debian 9. seem's it's something in this part: workers=32 for i in $ seq $ workers-1 0 ; do for tld in $ echo $tlds | awk nr+$i % $workers == 0 ; do check_tld ${1}.${tld} done & done i replaced this function with the one in the previous commit and it worked without color in output and there's a strange suffix ^ b^ m after every line. i'm trying to figure out why, but i don't know much of bash.
