 URL : "https://github.com/timgit/pg-boss/issues/44" TITLE : clearer assertion message BODY : right now the assert function is widely used in the code to validate execution results. this is very nice but sometimes the assertion message is not very clear because the assertion is written in a compact form. example in the manager.setstateforjob https://github.com/timgit/pg-boss/blob/master/src/manager.js l252 , an assertion is used to determine whether the update is successful: assert result.rowcount === 1, ${actionname} : job ${id} could not be updated. ; if it fails, it will print something likes actual: true, actual: false . this is not very clear since the result.rowcount could be zero or larger than one in this case. if such assertion could be rewritten using assert.equal to provide more precise error message, it would be very helpful for debugging.
