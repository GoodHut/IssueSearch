 URL : "https://github.com/mattgodbolt/compiler-explorer/issues/444" TITLE : ghc backend for haskell BODY : hey @mattgodbolt - i'm having a blast with your compiler explorer winning arguments on the internet about generated c++ code ; it looks like by now you also provide backends for d, rust and go. i asked around in the haskell community and nothing like your compiler explorer is available for the several intermediate representations ghc compiles haskell code down to. what's your take on having a ghc backend for compiling haskell code down to core and maybe all the way down to assembly? here's a high-level ghc overview: https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/commentary/compiler/generatedcode what's your take on this? what needs to be done to make this happen? the haskell community badly needs a tool like your compiler explorer for situations where haskell's high level abstractions need to be opened up to have a look what's actually going on.
