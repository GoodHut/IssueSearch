 URL : "https://github.com/Agadar/DankTimesBot/issues/42" TITLE : dynamically set bot name BODY : currently, the bot checks for commands meant for it using a regex. it checks for a command e.g. /start , or a command followed by the hard-coded name 'danktimesbot e.g. /start@danktimesbot . this obviously works well for the official bot, which carries that exact name, but if a third party were to host the bot himself then it would have a different name, maybe something like 'thedankestbot'. however, the regex would still only be passing commands targeted towards 'danktimesbot', i.e. /start@thedankestbot would not work for thedankestbot, while /start@danktimesbot would, even though that is now not the bot's name. hence, the bot should on launch find out what its name is, and dynamically set the regex accordingly. the bot name could be set in the settings file data/settings.json , though preferably it would be retrieved from the telegram api, if at all possible.
