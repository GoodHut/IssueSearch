BODY : a number of the icons pdf https://github.com/edent/supertinysocialicons/blob/master/tiny/pdf.svg , rss https://github.com/edent/supertinysocialicons/blob/master/tiny/rss.svg , wire https://github.com/edent/supertinysocialicons/blob/master/tiny/wire.svg , etc could be represented in fewer bytes by applying a stroke to a path, instead of it being an outlined and enclosed shape. any particular reason why this hasn't been done?
