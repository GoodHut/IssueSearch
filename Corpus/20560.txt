 URL : "https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr/issues/14" TITLE : commit rmd vs html BODY : as i'm working i realize there is a point of potential confusion. currently wflow_commit commits an rmd file, then renders it, then commits html. in some cases i might want to just commit the rmd file without rendering. eg when it is not yet ready one possibility of course would be to directly commit that via git on command line. but it might be nice to be able to do this via wflow, eg by having a render=false option to wflow_commit
