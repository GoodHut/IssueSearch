 URL : "https://github.com/nuxsmin/sysPass/issues/528" TITLE : result as cards BODY : hello rubÃ©n, great application, testing it for personal use right now. when application admin sets the config parameter: accounts -> results as cards -> true, a user still has the preference setting to view the account results as cards. in the code i saw that the config overrules the user-preference. if the user-preference has no effect, maybe it could be deactived, or perhaps not shown at all in the user preference? bug: version 2.1 2.1.5.17040401 accountsearch.class.php line 652 array is string i get a server error because in pickaccountcolor , accountcolor is set as string, but the return value should be an array. i changed it in my local source to make it work. rikkirt
