 URL : "https://github.com/erdewit/tws_async/issues/6" TITLE : throttling async requests BODY : i'm struggling to keep under the 100/req per second on reqmktdata snapshots. i have tried from pyqt5 import qtcore ... class tws twsclient : def requestbulkmktdata self, contracts: contract : for contract in contracts: nap = self.reqbucket.consume 1 reqid = self.getreqid qtcore.qtimer.singleshot nap, lambda: self.reqmktdata reqid, contract, '', true, false, this is using a token bucket to throttle. using time.sleep between will definitely not work with any of the event loops. i am using the qt implementation on ubuntu 16.04, using both a jupyter notebook and a plain execution.
