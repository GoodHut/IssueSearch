 URL : "https://github.com/neteoc/neteoc-server/issues/7" TITLE : get organization users BODY : ideally i'd like an option on the get organization endpoint that lets me specify that i want a bunch of information on it rather than making multiple calls . specifically, a member list that includes admins, members, and owner. with limited information given for each user such as display name.
