 URL : "https://github.com/Jiiks/BetterDiscordApp/issues/593" TITLE : dp3 minor inconveniences BODY : this issue is only related to the dp3 branch - closing settings on any of the bd tabs and re-opening settings results with split between settings and bd tab that active last before closing not sure whether its an actual bug since it is actually quite useful for quick-reloading plugins visual https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/119918741516451840/366896066072674314/unknown.png - bd settings also appear in server settings visual https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/119918741516451840/368418579667877889/unknown.png - clicking appearance crashes discord error https://puu.sh/y5xaf/54ff92a0bd.png - i guess rewritten path doesn't account for the relative paths. - styles in css editor don't persist after discord reloads - plugins have to be switched on each time after discord reloads - events class' .on function set s event into the map, rather than creating an array where multiple callbacks could be added, similar situation with .off where it just removes whatever entry there is from the map _personally, i'd prefer to do const { events } = window rather than having to define my own mutation observer and then proxy that to the eventemitter for my purposes_ - this middleware approach is great to make bd work between updates, but if update is significant enough to move folders e.g. from app-0.0.166 to app-0.0.167 , then bd doesn't move over, although this is an inconvenience since all it takes is to copy-paste a folder, it'd be nice if updates like that would be considered aswell oh, and i should mention that this is all happening on canary, not sure about other releases, but i could check it on ptb and stable, if needed. other than that, i've been trying to write emote plugin based on the existing bd plugin and using es6 classes seems pretty neat. _please excuse any grammatical or spelling errors i did not have enough rest lately i will be happy to elaborate on anything that i didnt explain properly or was confusing to understand_
