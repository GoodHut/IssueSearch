 URL : "https://github.com/gemini-testing/gemini/issues/816" TITLE : expose console messages BODY : we are working with react components and now and then developers tend to forget updating proptypes. react then in runtime would console.error about that, but with gemini there is no access to read console messages back to the tests. there are many other cases when browsers emit warnings and i think it's in scope of gemini to provide api for reading that. is there any workaround for that? just for reference here for example how it could be done with direct access to webdriver for chrome: js const webdriver = require 'selenium-webdriver' , logging = require 'selenium-webdriver/lib/logging' , chrome = require 'selenium-webdriver/chrome' const opts = new chrome.options opts.addarguments 'no-sandbox' const prefs = new logging.preferences prefs.setlevel logging.type.browser, logging.level.error const caps = webdriver.capabilities.chrome caps.setloggingprefs prefs const webdriver = new webdriver .builder .forbrowser 'chrome' .setchromeoptions opts .withcapabilities caps .build webdriver .then browser => browser.get 'http://localhost:8080' .then => driver.manage .logs .get logging.type.browser .then logs => { if logs.length throw new error 'console.error messages found' }
