 URL : "https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/7722" TITLE : builds marked as failing BODY : since a couple of days, builds which used to be successful are now marked as failing, even if there's no trace of failures in the logs. examples: https://travis-ci.org/bluescarni/mppp/jobs/229661221 https://travis-ci.org/esa/pagmo2/jobs/229444427 i don't know if it matters, but they are both documentation builds both involving sphinx and doxygen. how could i help to debug such an issue?
