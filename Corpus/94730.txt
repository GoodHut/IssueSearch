 URL : "https://github.com/keratin/authn-server/issues/9" TITLE : clarification on licensing BODY : this looks like a cool project, nice work! ✨ i was reading the readme and noticed it's mentioned as being gpl, though it looks like there's and lgpl license in the project root. might be good to clarify which license it is, i can open a pr for that if you want 💁‍♂️
