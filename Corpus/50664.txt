 URL : "https://github.com/arangodb/arangodb/issues/2477" TITLE : == null evaluates true BODY : my environment running arangodb i'm using the latest arangodb of the respective release series: - 2.8 - 3.0 - x 3.1 - 3.2 pre-releases: ___ - self-compiled devel branch on this operating system: - x linux - debian .deb - x ubuntu .deb - suse .rpm - redhat .rpm - fedora .rpm the aql query in question is: javascript return == null this returns true . instead i would be expecting it to return false , simply because the two lists/arrays are not equal. i checked this out in two other languages - javascript and python - and both of them return false . see the discussion https://arangodb-community.slack.com/archives/c07nv9nah/p1494400411397913 on slack for more. although as a workaround, to check if two arrays are the same, i can first check if their lengths are equal or not before doing the exact match.
