 URL : "https://github.com/JuliaData/CSV.jl/issues/122" TITLE : allow comments in csv.read BODY : i liked the option in dataframes.jl to allow comments through: df = readtable filename, allowcomments=true so i could write in my .csv files comments, such as: atom,epsilon,sigma c,12.0,3.1 from ref. 1 o,3.2,3.2 from ref. 2 see url xxx h,3.1,323.0 and this allowed the reader to skip a variable number of lines in the header as long as the line started with . is this possible in csv.read ?
