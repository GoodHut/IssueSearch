 URL : "https://github.com/kryptxy/torrench/issues/63" TITLE : re-writing nyaa module BODY : @datafanatic i am in process of introducing cross-site search in torrench. however integrating the nyaa module is becoming a little difficult, as it shares a completely different structure than other modules. it would have to be re-written in same format as the other modules tpb/kat... to integrate it. since you authored the nyaa module, i thought to run it by you before i proceed. i hope its fine by you?
