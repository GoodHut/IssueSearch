BODY : nicholas: please check the repo for the leal building to make sure we've got the readme text right should be fine , and more importantly... should the sketchup model be colored? it's all-white currently, but your text notes suggest that you did some research on the building colors. i can update the colors if you have a reference i can use. - ted
