 URL : "https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics/issues/1217" TITLE : actorreporter for akka BODY : i have a need for dw metrics to publish/report custom metrics to an akka actorsystem so that actors can handle them intelligently. my idea is to have simple/similar functionality as consolereporter , except instead of writing metrics to the console i'd be sending them to some metrics actor e.g. metricsactor.tell new metrictickupdate ... , null ; . i'm gonna go forward with this actorreporter concept for my project but would be willing to contribute if this community feels it would be a welcomed & useful addition.
