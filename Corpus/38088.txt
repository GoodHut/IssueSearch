 URL : "https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/19069" TITLE : node pipe<t> methods BODY : due to new strict generic checks, we are now getting errors for attempted implementations of the pipe method in various interfaces in node/index.d.ts . the signature is: ts pipe<t extends nodejs.writablestream> destination: t, options?: { end?: boolean; } : t; typescript now interprets this as saying that a pipe method must itself be generic on t . however, many implementations use a particular subtype of nodejs.writablestream in place of t . should we fix those implementations to be generic?
