 URL : "https://github.com/matthiasn/systems-toolbox/issues/44" TITLE : figwheel in project.clj BODY : i have tried both the example projects where dependencies to figwheel fails and does not build on cljsbuild. adding the following to dependencies solves the problem. figwheel 0.5.10 seems systems-toolbox-ui is deprecated. but both the example projects seems to have references to that and so naturally does not build. adding the following resolves that problem to dependencies matthiasn/systems-toolbox-ui 0.6.1-alpha11 how did you build these projects without systems-toolbox-ui if it was deprecated? what about figwheel as a dependency? i understand you have lein-figwheel as a plugin. but for whatever reason, the projects don't build without figwheel as a dependency. am i missing something. some notes as i am going through the book, some typos, grammar: 1. page 15 - well, that might indeed problematic ... should read well, that might indeed be problematic... i think. 2. page 17 - then, in the init-fn, we set ontouchmove and ontouchmove event.... should read then, in the init-fn, we set onmousemove and ontouchmove event.... i think. you missed the onmousemove function instead repeated ontouchmove. thanks, -vijay
