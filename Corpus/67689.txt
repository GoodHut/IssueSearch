 URL : "https://github.com/lhc70000/iina/issues/461" TITLE : proxy icon in title bar BODY : i think this app is very promising. thanks a lot for the effort. there is one feature i miss besides support for the apple remote : please have a proxy icon in the title bar when a video is open. a right click on it or the file name next to it should show a popup menu with the path to the file. i think this is standard in macos: https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/osxhiguidelines/windowappearancebehavior.html after watching a video i want to move the file to another folder. the proxy icon makes it very easy to do that: either drag the proxy icon to folder or right click on the proxy icon and open the folder that contains the file with a click. i'm not sure if there is another good way to find the file that is currently played in the finder. mplayerx doesn't have this feature which is a pain vlc has it, by the way .
