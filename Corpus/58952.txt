 URL : "https://github.com/dylanede/rusttype/issues/45" TITLE : support unscaled fonts BODY : currently, you cannot get a fonts ascender / descender without scaling the font. freetype as a ft_no_scale , which just gives you the raw metrics for the font. there is a glyph::unscaled thing, but it doesn't help, really. the font itself has to be unscaled to get the ascender and descender correctly. the function font::v_metrics &self, scale: scale -> vmetrics should accept a noscale or similar as the scale parameter.
