 URL : "https://github.com/certego/fw1-loggrabber/issues/25" TITLE : logs lagging behind BODY : since upgrading to v2 and not being able to set what fields to pull down, i am seeing lags in our logs. i checked resource usage on the server cpu, memory, and network that runs fw1-loggrabber and there's nothing alarming. is this an issue of the binary not being able to process logs fast enough or on the checkpoint server side?
