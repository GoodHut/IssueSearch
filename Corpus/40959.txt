 URL : "https://github.com/pnut-api/api-spec/issues/14" TITLE : way to look up pm id BODY : the way pms are handled, i can't look up the id of a pm between me and other people unless i know the id of the channel if it exists . if it's not in the first 20 or first 200 channels i'm subscribed to, or something similar, it can be hard to find out if a channel exists already. it would be convenient to be able to look that up. submit a list of user_ids/@-usernames and return the existing pm channel_id if it exists.
