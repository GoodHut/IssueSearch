 URL : "https://github.com/igvteam/igv/issues/391" TITLE : sashimi plot export BODY : --hi, sashimi plot is a very usefull function that allow to visualize splicing events, but it will be valuable to add an option to export the number of inclusions/depletions that occur. at this time we can only display those numbers in the graphics but it's not possible to save in a text file or other format the computed numbers. thank you -- laurent --
