 URL : "https://github.com/usgs-bcb/bcb-dm/issues/10" TITLE : forking and branching BODY : this will be my first time using github in this way. can someone clarify how i would contribute to the repository if i had code or comments to add? would i fork the bcb-dm repository, clone it to my computer, create a new branch that i edit, and then make a pull request to incorporate that new code? or is there a more direct way to do all that. nathan
