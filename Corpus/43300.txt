 URL : "https://github.com/cursive-ide/cursive/issues/1784" TITLE : control flow analysis BODY : intellij 2017.2 has a cool feature for control flow analysis: https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2017/06/intellij-idea-2017-2-public-preview/ which can understand methods on collections. not sure how much of this is possible in cursive, although maybe some annotations, type hints, and spec could help?
