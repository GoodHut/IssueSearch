BODY : your program is great, and i know it's focus is on image engraving. i like that it's a one stop shop app. i use my laser for cutting laser board to make small model parts. i tried your program today to do cutting and it worked, but i had to make the overall image file larger to cut the small parts. i used your vectorization mode which kind of worked, but because it traces a cut on both sides of a line the cut size was off. maybe in the future you could add a cut-mode where you make one cut path based on finding the middle of the existing two trace paths. and allow smaller image sizes. just a thought, good job!
