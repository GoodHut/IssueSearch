 URL : "https://github.com/JuliaReach/Reachability.jl/issues/21" TITLE : revisit inputstate BODY : i noticed that we might want to change the way the inputstate iterator works. we create a new instance for each time step for timevaryingnondeterministicinput only, but still . what about instead changing this wrapper such that it keeps the whole array updates its index internally i.e., it is a mutable type always returns the respective set corresponding to its current index additionally, instead of calling input_state.set , i propose to have a function, say, get input_state . for the array-backed iterator we could even consider just returning a view.
