 URL : "https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-jvm-sdk/issues/1627" TITLE : provide a fat/shadow jar BODY : some tools e.g. the etl tool from talend can't use a maven repository to fetch all transitive dependencies of our sdk. for these cases it would be nice if we could provide a fat/shadow jar of our sdk which contains all dependencies including our standard hhtp client and provide it as an additional artifact that we deploy to maven central.
