 URL : "https://github.com/clibs/clib/issues/140" TITLE : clib binary size BODY : compiled clib.exe size is about 600kb static. it seems to be blown by including all deps, when i change makefile to use something like: clib: src/clib.c deps/trim/trim.o deps/asprintf/asprintf.o deps/which/which.o deps/str-flatten/str-flatten.o deps/strdup/strdup.o deps/debug/debug.o deps/wildcardcmp/wildcardcmp.o $ cc $ cflags -o $@ $^ $ ldflags i get 20kb clib instead of 600kb. so maybe list each deps separately. i guess same would benefit clib-install and clib-search but probably to a lesser degree. p.s. compiled on windows 10 x64, with gcc and static libcurl
