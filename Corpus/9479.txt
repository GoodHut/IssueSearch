 URL : "https://github.com/wtfuii/TSOBot/issues/3" TITLE : write in groups BODY : first of all, i'm sorry if this is not the right place to write this. i wanted to request a feature: let the bot write into groups. right now if you write /subscribeall into a group, only the person that writes gets subscribed. it would be really nice if the bot could write into a group if people join a teamspeak server.
