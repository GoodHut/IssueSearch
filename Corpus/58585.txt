 URL : "https://github.com/chrmarti/testissues/issues/8244" TITLE : spacebar stops working BODY : spacebar and copy shortcut command+c just randomly stop working. copy only works with a right-click dropdown option select. both work fine in other running apps. i'm running into this issue on macos sierra. latest version of vs code 1.17.2 - but has happened with previous releases as well. read in another issue thread that a workaround for a similar issue was to shut down and restart which works here too , but a little frustrating to have that as the only solution. with a few projects open, integrated terminal tasks running in my workflow, on restart - vs code only remembers one of the projects i had open.
