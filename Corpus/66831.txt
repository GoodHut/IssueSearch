 URL : "https://github.com/grycap/scar/issues/204" TITLE : no space left on device BODY : i'm working with a custom image -- it's not particularly large -- it's based on the same ffmpeg image used in the example with a few additional packages. it shows up as 237mb when i run docker images . my container is running a bash script that runs some ffmpeg + imagemagick commands, and it's failing with error like below: > convert: anerrorhasoccurredwritingtofile /tmp/diascope/out_tmp/path-i001.png': no space left on device i didn't think i was hitting the 500mb /tmp restriction -- and i double checked my available diskspace with a df -h : > filesystem size used avail use% mounted on /dev/xvda1 526m 383m 132m 75% / /dev/xvda1 30g 4.8g 25g 17% /dev it seems to hit this disk space warning almost instantly after my script runs, so that eliminates the possibility of the disk space suddenly hitting capacity mid-script. not sure how to proceed on this, does anybody have any ideas?
