 URL : "https://github.com/Holocracy/Mixed-Reality-Hangout/issues/38" TITLE : create beta-testing plan BODY : 1. we have decided to have two test periods, to best accommodate all time zones. 2. tests will be documented ahead of time. 3. we could monitor the slack test channel for only the first 10-15 minutes of the test period, if there are problems they will have names for specific people to ping. 4. some tests can be performed individually, others synchronized with the group. 5. we need to give people time to acclimate to the environment before the start time first 15 minutes . 6. we need to tell people what we'd like them to do if they exit the app unexpectedly. 7. we need to let people know we will be recording the sessions, if we are. 8. link to survey will be posted directly after the test session. other items to consider for the tests themselves: - which person will lead the tests and what the rest of the team will do? - does the leader have a bell or other noisemaker to get people's attention? - shall we congregate in a particular place so people know where we are? do we need more disks different colours, in each floor corner ? - shall we have different colour avatars for ourselves so when we speak, people know which avatar we are? - who will the pingable contacts be for slack during the tests? - which things to test individually and which things to test as a group? - what do we want people to do if the app stops working? - could we ask people ahead of time to be prepared to write down details when unexpected things happen? for instance, if they are using a device, if they are on battery, was there an audio indicator before the crash, what was the crash experience etc. - shall we provide the list of tests to testers ahead of time like a meeting agenda ? - do we need one survey for each test group?
