 URL : "https://github.com/Sheights/StarboundSimpleVoreMod/issues/111" TITLE : stuck in an eaten state BODY : my friend had eaten me and i died from digestion right at the same time he switched to the healing mode. i respawn in my ship to find that i am still invisible and to find that i am unable to move, also i have unlimited regeneration that won't time out, i tried dieing again via /suicide and restarting the game. i seem to be stuck in some sort of mode to where it still thinks i am eaten by someone else. not sure if there is some sort of debug command to clear the effect or not. ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33545031/32655550-a339e5e2-c5d3-11e7-9528-3ae37e9fbd7f.png ~joshtiger 11/10/2017 4:56 am texas
