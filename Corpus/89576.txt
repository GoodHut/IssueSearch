 URL : "https://github.com/djesmond/csci4511w/issues/2" TITLE : randomise move in minimax BODY : currently the evaluate function returns the last best move from the action list. this means that up 0 will rarely be picked if it is just as good as other moves. we should change the algorithm to randomly select between all equally good moves or have the algorithm look on more state ahead and determine the best move.
