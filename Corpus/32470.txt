 URL : "https://github.com/NodeOS/NodeOS/issues/344" TITLE : use scoped packages BODY : now that we have a npm organization https://www.npmjs.com/org/nodeos and hope we move there soon all the nodeos packages, we'll need to rewrite all the require s to use scoped packages and also remove the nodeos- prefix from them, using @nodeos/ instead. this would help us to organice better and have a clear corporate identity by knowing what are the oficial nodeos packages and not just only nodeos related.
