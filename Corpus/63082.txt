 URL : "https://github.com/private-octopus/ithitools/issues/12" TITLE : define initial patterns BODY : the first document defined patterns for m4.3 now m3.3.3 by just their length. this does not seem sufficient. there are well defined classifiers for random text, hexa text, full numeric text. may want to add something about java script looking text. need to consider whether the pattern definition should be table driven, or maybe compiled from a syntax description.
