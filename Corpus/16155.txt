 URL : "https://github.com/db48x/emularity/issues/9" TITLE : how to implement? BODY : it always results in failed to download game data! , there is no working example anywhere i could find nor a guide how to implement - for example what should i put in the locateadditionalfiles function? it would be great to even have a minimal explanation to the different emulators because without a working example in which i could at least inspect the code its unusable to anyone who doesnt understand it already.
