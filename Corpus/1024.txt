 URL : "https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/8192" TITLE : ecl lib geo BODY : geo functionality is used in the firmware as well as in ecl. i am wondering if it is not worth the effort to combine them and make a separated lib or at least just use the one from ecl and whatever after closing the diff between ecl -geo and firmware-geo. i prefer to create a separated lib such that it can be used by other projects as well.
