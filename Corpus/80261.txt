 URL : "https://github.com/evaera/RbxSync/issues/17" TITLE : the plugin stops syncing BODY : sometimes after i hit play, the plugin detects that it needs to update, update the files, and after that it stops syncing. i think that is not a good ideia update the files while the game is playing, 'cause for every player joined in the game it will detect a new script , but nothing is really new there, is a copy made by roblox, that every player needs to have, and not only this is the problem, while the game is runnig, many things may change, but the plugin is detecting it as a project change, well, the project structure may change, but it doesn't mean that the project has changed. a simple fix, i guess, just do not update while the game is playing. i really love the plugin, but i can't use it while this is happenig
