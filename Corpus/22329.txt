 URL : "https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/768" TITLE : jazz up the readme BODY : the .readme.md for this repo is kind of sad. ðŸ˜¢ i would like to see the readme more focused on explaining what cypress is, why you would use cypress, simple install instructions , etc - for our users and have contributing the secondary focus. ideas to jazz up - add header from old readme branch. - embed 'why cypress' video directly into readme. - have simple 'npm install' instructions. - add some cool badges. gitter, npm package - don't make it too long - refer to the docs when necessary.
