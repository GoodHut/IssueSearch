 URL : "https://github.com/knowmetools/web-app-proxy/issues/35" TITLE : test randomly fails BODY : occasionally, the test_post_empty test in parse_auth/tests/views/test_registration_view.py fails. this is most likely due to the serializer's errors being an ordereddict subclass, so sometimes the order of response.data doesn't match up. since we don't actually care about the order, we can just cast both of them to dictionaries to do the comparison.
