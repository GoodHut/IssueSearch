 URL : "https://github.com/pg-irc/pathways-backend/issues/93" TITLE : implement a search api BODY : so, we need a search api, probably in place of the hsda one. our search api has a different set of requirements from theirs. for instance, while our data set includes many different taxonomy terms, we don't really want to expose all of those as search filters. it is likely that the list of filters we want to use will change quite fluidly, so it is better to treat them as content rather than baked in to the front-end. in addition, we need an api that responds in a way that lets the client very quickly put stuff on a map without any further network operations. i described what i think this api could look like over here: https://gist.github.com/dylanmccall/2875fe98953f27a08a4d337cdb0d179c. add a search/query endpoint, with no filters. it should return a result as described in 92, with services and related data in a single place. add a search/template endpoint that returns a list of available filters, and some hard-coded or auto-generated region filters. implement filtering for the search/query endpoint based on filters included in the request payload. a search should match nothing by default. add a mechanism to create field filters that are stored in the database. these filters must map to database queries. change the search/template endpoint to return filters from the database in addition to auto-generated region filters, and the search/query endpoint to understand filters that are described in the database.
