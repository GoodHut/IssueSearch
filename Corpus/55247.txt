 URL : "https://github.com/cvuorinen/angular1-async-filter/issues/5" TITLE : include rxjs 5 support BODY : i was about to extend this code a bit to support rxjs 5, but then i noticed that @vfeskov already did so, in this commit on his fork: https://github.com/vfeskov/angular1-async-filter/commit/ccbd9e2f8bb4deed7433f142755137e1850d25b7 this is a very helpful improvement for people mixing a1 and a2+ code in 2017, but his fork is not published to npm. would you consider bringing this commit in and publishing a new version?
