 URL : "https://github.com/fortuna-intelligence/tesseract-lambda/issues/3" TITLE : running test file BODY : this feels like a very basic question but i'm stumped so i'll ask it anyway. once you've run npm q1. do you zip the /tesseract-lambda directory or the contents? your instructions read like the top directory rather than the contents, but i wasn't sure how you call the test.js which is the next question... q2. do you call the test.js from the lambda framework or do you write a test lambda function that calls the test.js function?
