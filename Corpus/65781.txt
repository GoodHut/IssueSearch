 URL : "https://github.com/MarcoMeter/Beastly-Rivals-Onslaught/issues/10" TITLE : learning ai progression BODY : basically during spring, i worked on trying to achieve a learning ai behavior for an agent playing bro. the major reason why a reasonable behavior is not achieved yet is due to a lack of a suitable deep learning library. the current implementation is based on the version of convnetsharp used in deep-qlearning-demo-csharp https://github.com/dubezoniner/deep-qlearning-demo-csharp . this library lacks in features and performance. so the focus now is to develop a solution which is perfectly usable inside of unity. for this concern i'm working on contributing deep reinforcement learning to the current version of convnetsharp https://github.com/cbovar/convnetsharp , which features cuda. depending on the outcome, a python interface or a self made implementation using compute shaders is going to be considered. most likely, i'll start out with prototyping a python interface to clarify some uncertainties.
