 URL : "https://github.com/frgtn/rpcapd-linux/issues/5" TITLE : questions on linux usage BODY : hi, thanks for the port. i have been looking for a tool like this for a long time on linux. few queries: 1. i could compile it on ubuntu 17.04 by linking it directly to systems libpcap. i see that you have a patched version of libpcap, is this required? would this work if i directly link to system libpcap? 2. i saw the disclaimers but do you have know of any production usage to passively capture traffic and relay it to other hosts? any inputs will be appreciated. this is exactly the tool i am looking for but not sure about the stability and support etc.
