 URL : "https://github.com/rodolpheche/wiremock-docker/issues/6" TITLE : arguments for wiremock BODY : hi, i am trying to tie this together with another service, which i want to use to fetch some fake config data for testing. however, i'm using docker-compose and i can't figure out how to use --record-mappings --verbose or any other runtime argument i can see that you are running the actual wiremock.jar file here: https://github.com/rodolpheche/wiremock-docker/blob/master/dockerfile l32 would it be possible for you to add a new env_var , i.e. - wiremock_opts to make this a bit more configurable and usable in docker-compose ? i'd like to contribute, otherwise, i'll just have to do yet another fork :p thanks :
