 URL : "https://github.com/Wyqer/kp_liberation/issues/120" TITLE : cant use spartan on tanoa BODY : basic informations mission version: 0.951 map: tanoa used mods: rhs, cup, blastcore, advanced ai command towing and rapel, enhanced soundscape and dyno sound, f18, and other vest mods dedicated or local game: local github or workshop missionfile: workshop individual things did you edit anything in the missionfile? no if yes, what did you edit exactly? short issue description when i start a campaing in tanoa i cant use the spartan to hook fob container, the helicopter says that is part of the pa√≠d jet dlc and i need to buy it in order to use it expected behaviour being able to fly the spartan steps to reproduce the issue start a new campaing on tanoa screenshots, serverlog or any other helpful things i have tried several times and wont work even if i wipe progress. i think it may be related to the fact that in tanoa mission you dont need any mods something may be broken when mission detects other mods, or maybe has something to do with the uss freedom.. to confirm this theory i could try to start a fresh campaing on altis and report the behaviour
