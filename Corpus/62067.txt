 URL : "https://github.com/haiwen/seahub/issues/1656" TITLE : can't start via systemd BODY : hi, as i wrote here https://forum.seafile.com/t/cant-start-via-systemd in the forums i can't start seafile via systemd or similar services. i create this issue in seahub because i think the problem is with seahub. when i start seafile & seahub via systemd using the .service files provided from the manual i don't get any error messages, everything seems fine. i am able to use seafdav but when i try to use seahub i only get a 'page unavailable' message. seahub runs fine if i log into the seafile user manually with su seafile and then execute the start commands. when i look into the logs this error message https://hastebin.com/uwoyigimut.sql is printed in the seahub django log. also other tables than django_session appear in the log with similar error messages. the error message is strange because the django backend for sqlite appears in the stacktrace but i do not use sqlite and specified a mysql/mariadb backend in my seahub_settings.py which is used when starting manually . in my mysql db the tables exist but clearly not in a non-existent sqlite db. could it be that seahub ignores my seahub_settings.py file if started via systemd? i tried to delete the seahub_settings.pyc file because in my understanding the file is newly generated by seahub when its not there anymore. it wasn't generated new when started via systemd. i'm running a ubuntu 16.04 server with seafile 6.1.1 greetings, levin
