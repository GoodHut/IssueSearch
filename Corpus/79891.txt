 URL : "https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-openshift-agent/issues/84" TITLE : support api proxy access BODY : there are already some containers which are configured to be accessed via the api proxy in openshift. this means it would be nice to be able to specify that we want to be able to access the endpoint via the api proxy url instead of directly accessing the pod's ip address itself. this is probably not a great idea i don't think this will scale very well or be as performant as it could be . but this is probably a stop gap measure we will need to put in place until we have better adoption and can get our middleware containers updated.
