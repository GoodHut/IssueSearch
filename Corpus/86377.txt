 URL : "https://github.com/gkz/LiveScript/issues/946" TITLE : how is this test passing? BODY : feel like i am missing something obvious, but this line https://github.com/gkz/livescript/blob/master/test/regex.ls l99 compiles to js eq '\\' + '\\/', regexp '\\' + '\\/' .source ; where eq is a reference to node assert's strictlyequal right? . so it could be rewritten as js '\\' + '\\/' === regexp '\\' + '\\/' .source and when simplified further js \\/ === \\\/ which very clearly is not the same thing. having gone back through older versions, since 0.9.0 when the test was added, it has always resulted in the same not-equal value. so... how is that test suite passing?
