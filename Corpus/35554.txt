 URL : "https://github.com/Gwyrdain/apprentices-workshop/issues/163" TITLE : error importing area BODY : i've been writing a zone, and was getting to equipment resets. i've already created the mob reset. there are 5 iterations of 6 mobs, each iteration with the same equipment. i decided it would be faster to create one set of resets, download the zone, and copy/paste the equipment reset to each of the 30 or so mobs. i then uploaded the zone. the zone did upload, but it wiped out all but 2 resets, and i got the attached error. ! image https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10890489/23868744/958b65d6-07ee-11e7-8728-71ed19573b83.png
