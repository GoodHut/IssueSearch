 URL : "https://github.com/ghdna/cognito-express/issues/3" TITLE : local read of jwt tokens BODY : hi, would it be possible to provide ability to load jwt tokens from file system for example and pass them into the lib rather than making network call? the reason is our corporate proxy blocks the request from nodejs express app, which is the main reason i'm thinking of switching from server side to client side authentication, which means i need to use the tokens. in this scenario i would probably package the tokens with the application. p.s. do you know if the tokens change once the user pool is created? - aws documentation isn't clear on that. for the user pools i've created there seem to be always 2 tokens. thanks, paul
