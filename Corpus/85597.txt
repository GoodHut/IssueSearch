 URL : "https://github.com/ickc/pantable/issues/17" TITLE : filtering subcells of csv BODY : see 16 i've seen such feature request for other pandoc filters dealing with csv before, but i didn't give enough time to think about a good syntax for it and since i personally don't need this feature yet, i didn't give it a priority . and from the example given, the syntax is not very intuitive. although pantable is a 3rd party pandoc filter rather than native pandoc syntax because @jgm doesn't think csv format is markdown-ish enough i.e. can be read as plain text , i still want it to be as markdown-ish as possible.
