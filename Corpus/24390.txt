 URL : "https://github.com/dancyfang/RealEstate_Manhattan/issues/10" TITLE : sss342 peer review BODY : the purpose of this project is to predict the full market value of different lots in the manhattan area. i can certainly see where this project is useful since it can be used as estimators for real estate companies to use. i think data like this would be extremely useful since they will be using the pluto dataset. i think the group has a very comprehensive understanding of all of the variables involved in the project. i like how the group was very thorough in their data cleaning. the group seems to have a good understanding of where the project is heading there were a few things that concerned me in this project however. figure 1 is way too small and very hard to read or even understand what is happening. assigning dummy variables like 1->10 or 1->6 is dangerous because that implies that a house with an assignment of 2 is twice in value of a house with an assignment of 1. finally, i was not able to understand if the group is going to be able to tell if their model would underfit or not.
