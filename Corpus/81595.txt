 URL : "https://github.com/jrleeman/PiBooth/issues/10" TITLE : /etc/inittab file missing BODY : following the instructions from nuts and volts : i entered sudo nano /etc/inittab and the editor did open up, but it was a blank file with new file showing at the bottom of editor. i looked in the /etc folder and did not see a inittab file. i was able to skip that step and move on to edit the profile file with sudo nano /etc/profile without issue, adding the command from the article made the photobooth program start up automatically on power up.
