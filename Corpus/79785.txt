 URL : "https://github.com/CompletelyFairGames/dwarfcorp/issues/371" TITLE : strangeness with pausing BODY : - clicking 'continue' from the settings dialog that pops up on pressing escape always unpauses the game, even if it was paused before pressing escape - game should remember original state when exiting dialog, and maybe change button text to 'back to game'. - can use pause key to pause/unpause while 'escape' settings dialog is active - unpausing should close the dialog. - start a new game, pause, then check 'disable' and close the tutorial. when unpausing or opening the economy screen, the 'time' tutorial window will open.
