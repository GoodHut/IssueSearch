 URL : "https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/565" TITLE : can't close boostnote BODY : when i press the x at the top right, it minimizes the window instead of closing it. i know some apps do that, but usually they have an option to fix it, i can't find any. i am using windows 10 with the creators update installed if that matters.
