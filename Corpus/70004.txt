 URL : "https://github.com/RepComm/JEditSyntaxPackage/issues/1" TITLE : update for modern usage BODY : i'm going to go through and update as much as i can about this project. -the readme needs to be styled, and i am going to include full information on how to use and re-build the project. i don't want to be dependent on jedit site to be up. i'll see about adding some actual features at some point.
