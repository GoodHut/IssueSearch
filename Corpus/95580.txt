 URL : "https://github.com/DapperDox/dapperdox/issues/82" TITLE : defining an array response BODY : dapperdox version 1.1.1 one of my endpoints returns an array of strings. i have defined the response as follows: responses : { 200 : { description : , schema : { type : array , items : { type : string } } } } when i run dapperdox i get the following error: references a model definition that does not have a title member . if my response is an object with a title no errors are displayed. have i made an obvious mistake, or does dapperdox not support array requests or responses? thanks.
