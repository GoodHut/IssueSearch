 URL : "https://github.com/japanesemediamanager/ShokoServer/issues/588" TITLE : http bans on refactor BODY : commit; 0aacabf943f6e02024777b16c9f373bb02894e10 i seem to still be running into http bans on refactor. below is a log from the point of booting shoko, until the point of the ban. for this test i had an empty db that i let shoko server identify some random files from, to then lookup show/episode/etc information. some files had been already imported when this log starts. log: https://gist.github.com/ctrlaltdefeat94/8207904532524e53ca2bc57a640c540a note, please ignore the h rated results, this is a dummy db for the purpose of getting the http ban, given that my own queue is empty/not doing much per day
