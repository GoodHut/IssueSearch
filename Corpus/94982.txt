 URL : "https://github.com/conventional-changelog/validate-commit-msg/issues/100" TITLE : configurable commit scopes BODY : hey, we are currently trying to improve the quality of our commit messages and settled on an approach similar to this one: https://dev.bleacherreport.com/how-we-use-commitizen-to-clean-up-commit-messages-a16790dcd2fd one remaining issue is the validation of our scopes: while there seems to be some standardization, when it comes to types https://github.com/commitizen/conventional-commit-types , there doesn't seem to be an equivalent when it comes to scopes. obviously scopes vary a lot more than types, but what would be great, would be a mechanism so that all tools in the ecosystem read the scopes from the same place/config. so for example validate-commit-msg uses its own config setting https://github.com/conventional-changelog/validate-commit-msg allowed while tools/adapters like cz-customizable have another config https://github.com/leonardoanalista/cz-customizable options that said ... did i eventually miss a solution to the problem? and if not, do you have an idea how to address this? would it be an idea to use a conventional-changelog -option in the package.json file to define the scopes for a project, that all interested libs can refer to? config : { conventional-changelog : { scopes : 'scope-a , scope-b } }
