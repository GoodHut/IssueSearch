 URL : "https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/8816" TITLE : meteor tutorial correction BODY : while a bug, it's in the tutorial, so not sure as to whether it belongs here. following the tutorial, i got stuck on the collections section: https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/react/collections specifically, when it states import '../imports/api/tasks.js'; i was getting nothing on the client side. changing this to import {tasks} from '../imports/api/tasks.js'; fixed it for me. i'm running the latest meteor 1.5 if that's any indication, macosx 10.12. thanks.
