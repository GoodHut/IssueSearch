 URL : "https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/387" TITLE : warden group metadata BODY : i think, currently under warden the groups are managed just by an id and i feel its very minimal. but if it can fetch additional information from a configured api or providing few more fields like name description active status and an extras field - which can store any text data json or other text data and extras type which can specify the storing data type, like json, text , xml ext which avoids using an external logic or access to identify the groups metadata which is usually very minimal for most use cases. please suggest whats the planned usage of this feature.
