 URL : "https://github.com/TaoK/PoorMansTSqlFormatter/issues/171" TITLE : sublime text plugin? BODY : timothy kim asks whether there is a sublime text plugin. while there isn't, there is a command-line formatter for windows by default - compiling in linux/mono may be not-entirely trivial, it's untested in the last 4 years . with the command-line formatter and some sort of invoke command glue in sublime text, in-place formatting should be straightforward to achieve. one sublime text plugin that provides such invoke command functionality using stdin and stdout, as supported by the command-line formatter is filterpipes : https://packagecontrol.io/packages/filterpipes so it looks like there should be a pretty straightforward workaround... but i haven't tested.
