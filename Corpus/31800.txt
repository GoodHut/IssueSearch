 URL : "https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd/issues/144" TITLE : support onmove hook BODY : bug or feature request? feature request context: we're building a nested list so elements can not only move up & down, but left or right to become a new parents or child . we want to provide a visual indication while an item is moved i.e. before ondragend so we can update the ui to indicate if they'll create a child or parent element. feature: it's be helpful if the library would support an onmove callback in addition to ondragstart and ondragend , e.g. js // fire-hooks.js if currentphase === previousphase { onmove { current: current, previous: previous } ; return; }
