 URL : "https://github.com/shymmq/librus-client/issues/90" TITLE : add dashboard view BODY : instead of proposed in 61 dzisiaj and jutro views i would suggest adding a single dashboard view aggregating events that are happening today, will happen tomorrow and happened in the past. past events would consist of added / modified grades, announcements, attendances and messages. future events would contain events like tests or lesson substitutions
