 URL : "https://github.com/fastify/fastify/issues/489" TITLE : are decorators scoped? BODY : i'm setting up my auth as a plugin, i.e.: js // auth setup fastify.register fastify, opts, next => { fastify.decorate 'verifyjwt', request, reply, done => { // ... } ; } ; then in other place i register a bunch of routes that should be protected by auth, so i follow the example, i.e.: js fastify.register fastify, opts, next => { fastify.addhook 'prehandler', fastify.auth fastify.verifyjwt ; // methods... } ; the code above throws errors. am i correct in my assumption that decorators are scoped along with hooks ? if yes - this should be mentioned in the docs.
