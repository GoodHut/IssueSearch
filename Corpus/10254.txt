 URL : "https://github.com/getgrav/grav/issues/1341" TITLE : bug on gif files BODY : hello, i found a strange behaviour when using gif files with default media config. i have: grav@1.1.17 default media config: gif's type is 'animated' a page foo.lang.md with a headers' key containing a gif filename bar.gif an alternative for this file i.e. bar.gif & bar@2x.gif in the page folder i guess this is important to reproduce bug a twig template calling page.media to retrieve gif's url i get: > twig_error_runtime > an exception has been thrown during the rendering of a template division by zero . on the line calling page.media. the line throwing 'division by 0' is actually system/src/grav/common/page/media.php:144 the object used here does not have width and height because mediumfactory gives me a staticimagemedium system/src/grav/common/page/medium/mediumfactory.php:87 . everything is fine with 'image'. doc is cool but should dig deeper for this kind of stuff. hope this helps!
