from: jens gerlach &lt;<jensgerlach@posteo.de>&gt; when running coqide 8.4 built through opam on osx 10.8.4,
i regularly see warnings such as: objc 762 : object 0x7fd2c1ce1a10 of class nsconcretemaptable autoreleased with no pool in place - just leaking - break on objc_autoreleasenopool to debug for large coq files , the ide crashes from time to time.
