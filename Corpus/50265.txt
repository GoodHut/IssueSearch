 URL : "https://github.com/huin/goupnp/issues/17" TITLE : windows / osx support BODY : i apologize if this is more of a support question than an actual issue, although i would expect this to work properly on osx and windows out of the box. i've created a very bare-bones simple ssdp test to verify ssdp discovery of roku devices package main import fmt github.com/huin/goupnp/httpu github.com/huin/goupnp/ssdp func main { fmt.println searching httpu_client, _ := httpu.newhttpuclient responses, _ := ssdp.ssdprawsearch httpu_client, roku:ecp , 2, 3 for _, response := range responses { fmt.println response } } when i compile and run this on my linux box ubuntu 17.04 it works no problem and i get one discovered roku device response searching... &{200 ok 200 http/1.1 1 1 map server: roku upnp/1.0 roku/7.7.0 location: http://192.168.1.10:8060/ wakeup: mac=08:05:81:25:89:51;timeout=10 cache-control: max-age=3600 st: roku:ecp usn: uuid:roku:ecp:yy005f185283 ext: 0xc42005e200 -1 true false map 0xc420104000 <nil>} but when i compile and run the same thing on my macbook and two other windows machines on my network, i get no response back. my guess as to what's happening is that there are already services listening on port 1900, but looking at the httpu code, it looks like it's just binding to any available ephemeral port, not 1900, so it should work just fine. any ideas? i want to be able to do device discovery from any of those oses without requiring disabling the network discovery service or whatever may be bound to port 1900 already thanks!
