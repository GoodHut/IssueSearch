BODY : are there any special considerations when trying to use this project as a dll rather than a console application? i tried to move the code to a dll, make wrapper functions to return a pointer to an instance of simpleconsole, and then use wrapper functions to call executecommand on that instance. i have not yet been able to get it working from either golang with the syscall package, or from another c++ console application using loadlibrary and getprocaddress. if this is not doable in theory, can someone please tell me why? thanks to anyone who can help.
