 URL : "https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-geolocation/issues/73" TITLE : ios demo app improvements BODY : using the app on ios simulator i noticed the following: - if i try to get the current location it doesn't prompt to enable location service. - after pressing 'start monitoring' button it only shows a few location points and stops. on a real device, the same as above issues happen plus app does not prompt to enable wi-fi which seems vital.
