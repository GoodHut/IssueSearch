 URL : "https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis-python/issues/701" TITLE : show succeeding example? BODY : i am testing an api and have found a bug. the bug is that some data was validated when it shouldn't have been. this is a problem on the api side. my question, i have a list of examples in .hypothesis/examples/<hexstring>/ . i'd like to find exactly what was sent/generated by hypothesis but the data in each of these files is unreadable. it looks nothing like the input fields that ended up in the tested system. how can i read these example files so that i can show the succeeding example?
