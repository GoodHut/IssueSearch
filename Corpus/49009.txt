 URL : "https://github.com/davisonio/craig-server_game/issues/84" TITLE : suggestion: party mod BODY : i created a party mod a short while back; https://github.com/fishywet/party its functionality is quite similar to that of the faction plugin from minecraft. essentially, this is a better version of 58 it supports beyond private channels, a full list of features can be understood from https://github.com/fishywet/party/wiki additionally, i have added support for the irc mod, in which private chat channels messages can be deferred from being sent to the irc channel. and to counter any chat-related abuse in private chat, all chats are logged and admins & moderators can be granted the pspy privilege which will allow them to view all messages, even those from private channels. i'm posting this as an issue first, because this is a rather big change.
