 URL : "https://github.com/pivotal-cf/om/issues/39" TITLE : dial tcp: i/o timeout BODY : the opsmanager host is unavailable for a few second to 1-2 minutes on random occasions. we blame it on the cloud right now because there's really nothing pointing to any other problems. we have that problem since we started using om, at its very initial release. our pcf installation pipelines are often failing because om isn't resilient enough in those situations. would it be possible to add an internal retry on those errors? we're working around the problem for apply-changes, where it is very likely to happen because of the long duratinn of the connection but we don't want to generalize that code to all om usages: https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pcf-a1/blob/terraform2/tasks/scripts/apply-changes.sh thanks pierre + om -k -t https://pcf.dev-1-9-azure-clean.iet.to.cf-app.com -u admin -p jejeebrok9 configure-product --product-name p-rabbitmq --product-properties '{ .rabbitmq-server.server_admin_credentials : { type : simple_credentials , value : { identity : rabbitadmin , password : rabbitpassword } } }' --product-resources '{ rabbitmq-server : { internet_connected : false }, rabbitmq-haproxy : { internet_connected : false }, rabbitmq-broker : { internet_connected : false }, broker-registrar : { internet_connected : false }, broker-deregistrar : { internet_connected : false } }' configuring product... setting properties finished setting properties applying resource configuration for the following jobs: broker-deregistrar broker-registrar rabbitmq-broker could not execute configure-product : could not fetch existing job configuration: could not make api request to resource_config endpoint: token could not be retrieved from target url: post https://pcf.dev-1-9-azure-clean.iet.to.cf-app.com/uaa/oauth/token: dial tcp: i/o timeout
