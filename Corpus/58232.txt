 URL : "https://github.com/NucleusPowered/Nucleus/issues/969" TITLE : secret join permission BODY : i was wondering if it were possible to add a secret join permission. essentially all it does is if a rank has this perm, it will not announce the player has joined the game and set them in vanish. this is to help catch out cheaters! it use to be a thing on spigot servers and it was extremely handy! thanks <!-- before reporting a bug or requesting a feature, please make sure you have as much information as possible. check our contributing guidelines for more on what we're looking for. this is linked above this box, in the yellow box. it might be helpful to include the output of /nucleus info as a separate paste. run this command, a file will be put into the nucleus directory on your server. -->
