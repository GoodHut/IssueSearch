 URL : "https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/issues/5674" TITLE : add code of conduct BODY : while clicking around the github project i noticed this page: https://github.com/icinga/icinga2/community which rightfully notes we don't have a code of conduct and i don't see why we should not have one, considering the project is steadily growing and we expect it to continue to do so. the 'contributor covenant' looks good to me we only have to put in a contact e-mail for abuse reports .
