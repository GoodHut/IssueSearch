 URL : "https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/issues/22419" TITLE : change linux download link BODY : as have been clarified here: https://www.reddit.com/r/cataclysmdda/comments/6raijb/dropping_32bit_linux_experimentals/ url linux 32 builds are not being automatically being built anymore. but the download link on the website still links to the 32 bit version. perhaps it would be best to change the link from http://dev.narc.ro/cataclysm/jenkins-latest/linux/tiles/ url to http://dev.narc.ro/cataclysm/jenkins-latest/linux_x64/tiles/ url for both the terminal and tiles version.
