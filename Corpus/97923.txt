 URL : "https://github.com/alteous/euler/issues/1" TITLE : idea: include collision-rs BODY : background: i wrote my own bounds struct, because i overlooked that collision-rs already has and aabb3 that is just what i need didn't associate bounding boxes with collision detection, so i ignored the lib... . for a 'go-to' cg math wrapper i'd expect bounding boxes and perhaps also some other features of collision-rs .
