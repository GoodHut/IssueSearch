BODY : the problems - most players are engaging at the lowest platform because of the long and flat design. - the higher platforms are too short - many movement skills over shoot the distance of these. - symmetrical map makes it hard to distinguish where you are. the solutions - change the bottom platform to not be flat to encourage height traversal. - extend the short platforms in relation to a changed bottom platform to facilitate the height movement. - each platform has distinguishing design features - land marks that are easily recognized. - create an interesting asymmetrical map.
