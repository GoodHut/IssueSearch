 URL : "https://github.com/LaravelCollective/remote/issues/56" TITLE : host ip will not update BODY : hello, laravelcollective/remote has been working great for quite some time. i needed to change the ip address of one of the servers, so off to app/remote.php i went. i made the change. in my laravel project, i can php artisan tinker and ssh::into 'dhcp_server' ->run ls -l /etc ; however, one of my listeners calls ssh::into 'dhcp_server' .... also. when i fire the event, the listener executes, but is trying to use the old ip that is no longer in app/remote.php . i am very confused as to what might be causing this. artisan commands i've blindly run: clear-compiled , cache:clear , config:clear , config:cache , and view:clear . still it continues to attempt to connect to the old ip. here is the error. the ip shown here is the old ip. production.error: errorexception: cannot connect to 10.0.0.101:22. error 113. no route to host in /usr/share/nginx/html/goldaccess/vendor/phpseclib/phpseclib/phpseclib/net/ssh2.php:1011 thoughts?
