 URL : "https://github.com/Jitnaught/JNSoundboard/issues/24" TITLE : multi channel support BODY : minor issue, just in case someone wonders. trying to play something else than mono or stereo sounds probably crashes the application... https://github.com/jitnaught/jnsoundboard/blob/ea7b09acf1e89b5c8745ff0580b417970541ed35/audioplaybackengine.cs l85 probably the easiest solution is a multiplexingsampleprovider https://github.com/naudio/naudio/blob/master/naudio/wave/sampleproviders/multiplexingsampleprovider.cs with output count 2, mapping just the first two input channels and ignoring the others. a better solution would be to mix the channels. something like this from voicemeeterbanana manual https://www.vb-audio.com/voicemeeter/voicemeeterbanana_usermanual.pdf : > mix down a processing > rear & side speaker are mixed out of phase to simulate surround effect in stereo > left = fl + 70% fc + sw + rl - sl > right = rl + 70% fc + sw - rr + sr > mix down b processing > rear & side speaker are mixed in phase > left = fl + 70% fc + sw + rl + sl > right = rl + 70% fc + sw + rr + sr
