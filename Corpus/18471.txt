 URL : "https://github.com/shihjay2/nosh2/issues/63" TITLE : test sms reminder BODY : i was testing out the new option to input the address of your own textbelt server, and realized that the test reminder for sms messages doesn't seem to be working. whether i am using the default textbelt server or my own doesn't seem to matter--no banner pops up confirming that a message was sent, and no message is received. sms reminders do go out appropriately for events, the only thing not working is the test reminder button in demographics>contacts.
