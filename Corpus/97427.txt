 URL : "https://github.com/mikeperry-tor/mission-improbable/issues/44" TITLE : google set-up wizard error BODY : hello world, i have installed this prototype on nexus 6p, but when script tells me to reboot into system, and potentially skip the google setup, i get a problem. the problem is getting through the setup. on the first screen i select the language, then i get the choice between a clean beginning or transferring data from a backup or other device, and then when i select the clean install though the other option fails as well with the exact same result , i get a black screen. on the black screen in the right top are three white symbols. i think those were, the 'missing simcard' symbol, the battery and the time. and the time is blinking. nothing happens after that. the system is responsive to the powerbutton and gives the option to restart or shutdown. few times i got a pop-up telling me the set-up wizard was non-responsive and it gave me the choice to shut it down or wait, but it did not matter anyway. a clean copperheados install works just fine. though i did have some problems with tmp size, since it can't contain 2gb. so i had to flash it manually instead of using the script. with the prototype, when the script runs, it does seem to give an error with libsepol. ... libsepol.avtab_read_item: more than one specifier libsepol.avtab_read: failed on entry 274 of 8089 error s encountered while parsing configuration could not load policy /home/onionun/downloads/mission-improbable-master/helper-repos/super-bootimg/scripts /tmp/tmp.1wflbzxxeb /tmp/tmp.1wflbzxxeb 1381 blocks ... i look forward hearing from anyone who can help.
