 URL : "https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/issues/841" TITLE : grepping all the rust code BODY : github already allows searching in the code, but it's not always easy to grep in all the rust code : if the search term is generic and matches projects in other languages better, rust won't be listed in the sidebar and you'll have to mingle the url to get what you need. example: https://github.com/search?utf8=%e2%9c%93&q=hello&type=code i think somewhere there should be an easy-to-use grep ui for the rust projects. does crates.io have anything planned? if not, maybe we can have a ui to make it easier to search in github for now? what do you think?
