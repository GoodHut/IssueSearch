 URL : "https://github.com/openemr/openemr/issues/1142" TITLE : thoughts on tabs? BODY : we have what i presume is some home-grown tabs code with the tabbify function in library/js/common.js. it's not very capable, for example doesn't support dynamic adding and removing of tabs. the tabs layout is based on knockout js, not my cup of tea. i noticed the jquery ui tabs widget https://jqueryui.com/tabs/ . that looks pretty good. anyone have experience with it? other ideas? my immediate interest here is turning the encounter frame into a tabbed area with each form that you open in its own tab.
