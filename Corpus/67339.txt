BODY : currently receiving this error on android studio 2.4 preview 7: > annotation processors must be explicitly declared now. the following dependencies on the compile classpath are found to contain annotation processor. please add them to the annotationprocessor configuration. - auto-service-1.0-rc2.jar alternatively, set android.defaultconfig.javacompileoptions.annotationprocessoroptions.includecompileclasspath = true to continue with previous behavior. note that this option is deprecated and will be removed in the future. see https://developer.android.com/r/tools/annotation-processor-error-message.html for more details. i believe the https://github.com/rharter/auto-value-gson/commit/a94fd1b3e7ced736013c395715d393606e26de68 commit should fix this. please correct me if i'm wrong javapoet https://github.com/rharter/auto-value-gson/blob/a94fd1b3e7ced736013c395715d393606e26de68/auto-value-gson/build.gradle l9 might need to be compileonly as well, but not sure. similarly for https://github.com/rharter/auto-value-parcel
