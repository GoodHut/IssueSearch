 URL : "https://github.com/root-systems/cobuy/issues/156" TITLE : composable resource type s BODY : when i create or update a resource type , the resource type i am describing might be composed of sub resource types . for example: i want to buy a carton of eggs. the resource carton of eggs contains 1x carton and 12x egg resources. ! screenshot_20170824_175755 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/719605/29754815-28e2239e-8be1-11e7-956d-450a01de4013.png benefit here: cobuy will be able to track packaging as resourceful materials, as in no resources are out of scope circular economy . for example: i want to buy a laptop. the resource laptop contains 1x laptop case , 1x laptop screen , 2x 8 gb memory stick , 1x 256 gb hard disk , etc. benefit here: cobuy can make it easy to buy pre-bundled products like laptops, where each item is configurable with facets. for example: i want to buy a christmas special. the resource christmas special is a bundle of other products offered by that supplier, specific for the christmas holiday. for example: i want to buy a set of uniforms. the resource set of uniforms contains 1x uniform shirt , 1 pair of uniform pants , 1x pairs of uniform socks , etc. this was developed in https://github.com/root-systems/cobuy/pull/141 based on https://github.com/root-systems/cobuy/issues/137, but i now think and had a chat with @agentlewis that we should remove this from scope for our initial beta release, allowing us to better focus on the features that _are_ in the initial beta release.
