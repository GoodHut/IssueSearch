 URL : "https://github.com/burst-digital/hn-react/issues/8" TITLE : add ssr support BODY : to add ssr support to hn-react, there should be some functions that handle the data and make sure everything is available before rendering. on the server: js site.reset site.initialize drupalpage.assuredata / react render / site.dehydrate ; // send this data to the client on the client: js site.initialize site.hydrate / server data / .then => require '../root.js' ; this means site.dehydrate should provide these things: - x the data object - x the user data user token and tokens to verify - the page uuid this means the site.hydrate should do these things: - x get the server data object and add it to its own data object - x get the user data object and merge it with its own data object - get the page uuid from the request and make sure the mapped component is available to still keep the hn and hn-react packages seperate, the hydrate and dehydrate should move to hn-react and they invoke the same functions from the hn package .
