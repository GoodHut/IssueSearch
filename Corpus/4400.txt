 URL : "https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/912" TITLE : click to clone BODY : seeing the first-time contributor badge https://twitter.com/coralineada/status/845290990705545217 , i would see the click to clone feature as a nice complementing feature. when reviewing a pull request, i'd quickly like to get the code. for instance, https://github.com/jabref/jabref/pull/2189. i'd like to click on forkowner:branchname e.g., mr-dlib:master to be brought to the repository where the pr comes from. then, i can click on clone or download to clone the repository. currently, i am doing url writing by generating the github repository url manually. this is imho unnecessary work, which may be avoided with a simple hyperlink. ! grabbed_20170130-074801 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1366654/24322244/9b725bc4-115f-11e7-81a9-a645af2f7624.png
