 URL : "https://github.com/ix-project/ix/issues/24" TITLE : support for mlx4 driver? BODY : i am interested in this because i use the m510 machines on cloudlab http://docs.cloudlab.us/hardware.html %28part._cloudlab-utah%29 regularly in research and these machines have mellanox connectx-3 10gb ethernet cards. i would also like to know more about the efforts required to support a new type of nic. for example, i notice that the sizes of dp/drivers/{ixgbe,i40e}.c are pretty small. thanks!
