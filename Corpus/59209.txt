 URL : "https://github.com/ivaylokenov/AspNet.Mvc.TypedRouting/issues/28" TITLE : this keyword required? BODY : in the following scenario, keyword this is required; i assume this is because you have two generic methods with both tcontroller : controller and tcontroller : class . this is annoying. why do you need the tcontroller: class version? am i missing something? c using microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc; namespace mynamespace { public class homecontroller : controller { public iactionresult index { return this.redirecttoaction<othercontroller> c => c.index ; } } }
