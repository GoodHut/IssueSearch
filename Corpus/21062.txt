 URL : "https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-python/issues/834" TITLE : double logging bug BODY : i have a small autobahnpython app in two files this: python file runner.py import logging import sys from autobahn.asyncio.wamp import applicationrunner from .component import component logging.basicconfig level=10 logger = logging.getlogger __name__ def run : logger.info 'starting server' runner_kwargs = { 'url': 'wss://demo.crossbar.io/ws', 'realm': 'realm1'. } runner = applicationrunner runner_kwargs runner.run zeitsonde if __name__ == '__main__': run python file component.py import asyncio import logging from autobahn.asyncio.wamp import applicationsession, applicationrunner logger = logging.getlogger __name__ logger.setlevel 10 class zeitsonde applicationsession : def __init__ self, config : logger.debug 'init' super .__init__ config async def onjoin self, details : logger.debug 'server has joined to wamp router' await asyncio.sleep 3 logger.debug 'server has joined to wamp router 2' this code should work. the problem is that the log messages from runner.py and sometimes the init message appear once and the log messages from inside the onjoin method appear always twice in the log in different format . i can not imagine why. also if i remove the setlevel from the second file the logging disappears although the root logger was set to debug in the first file. i use python 3.6.1 and autobahn 0.18.1 archlinux . any idea about this hidden logging magic? thanks in advance.
