 URL : "https://github.com/douglascrp/alfresco-cloud-store/issues/11" TITLE : jeff potts feedback BODY : this feedback was provided by @jpotts back in january, 14, 2017 > i had problems with the alfresco-cloud-store add-on for one of my clients that had a similar need to move a lot of data to alfresco on aws. the client had some very large files and those were frequently getting hung up as they were being transferred from local storage to s3. the client ended up dropping the s3 requirement and just paying for standard storage. > > so before you commit to alfresco ce on s3, you should obviously do a lot of testing using realistic use cases and data sizes/volumes.
