 URL : "https://github.com/MangoTheCat/rcloud.jupyter.notebooks/issues/2" TITLE : support shell language BODY : in the celllanguage function what happens if you have a .sh shell script? https://github.com/mangothecat/rcloud.jupyter.notebooks/blob/301d237b1a74548683f096033fc65102611cd18d/r/export_jupyter.r l117 we should add in a .sh option and think about what happens if it's something else. for example: a julia cell not supported in rcloud but it supported in jupyter would be a .jl file. i wonder if having a little lookup would be useful? just for the major 5/6 languages. see here for the ridiculously complete list of languages that github understands by file extension https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/c8ca48856b1998681cdf1c1234145532006f95d8/lib/linguist/languages.yml
