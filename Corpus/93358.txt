 URL : "https://github.com/idaholab/moose/issues/9789" TITLE : add set method to piecwise BODY : description of the enhancement or error report add a method to piecewise to allow the x and y data to be set explicitly. rationale for the enhancement or information for reproducing the error mastodon requires the x,y data for a linearpiecewise function to be transfered from the master application, thus a method to set the data is needed. identified impact i.e. internal object changes, limited interface changes, public api change, or a list of specific applications impacted generally, very little impact will exist for users and applications. however, since i am changing piecewise i will also clean it up to utilized delimitedfilereader rather than parsing the file itself. this will require some improvements to the reader to support row organized data and comments. but, this will provide more functionality.
