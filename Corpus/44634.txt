 URL : "https://github.com/mikepenz/FastAdapter/issues/336" TITLE : filtering on a thread BODY : sometimes my implementation of iitem has not all the info loaded as soon as i add it, some like images are being loaded only when displayed. now, if i want to filter based on a field that might require some time to be loaded i currently need to do the search on my own and then set the adapter again with the items i filtered. it would be nice to allow filtering on a thread so then out of the ui a list of matching items is prepared and then back in ui thread the adapter is actually filtered. is this too complex / out of library scope?
