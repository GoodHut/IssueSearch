BODY : i was looking at your implementation for a worker pool in go and i really like the way you approached it; in that you can submit at any time and it adds it to the queue. most implementations seem to operate off of a set of known tasks a priori. secondly, it doesn't delay the submission channel and this is very important because in my case if i lag even just a few milliseconds or 10s of milliseconds from the event firing, i will miss the next event. so far so good. however, what i am struggling to figure out is how to put a delay in somewhere so that i can set the time between executions for each task without interfering with the incoming events. this delay is especially needed for the first set of workers that get added to the pool because they get fired off simultaneously. i need at least some spacing for the web server to breathe a bit before i lay siege on it. ; any suggestions on where i can add this delay?
