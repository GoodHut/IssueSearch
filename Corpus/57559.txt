 URL : "https://github.com/WICG/transfer-size/issues/16" TITLE : questions about design BODY : it seems like one of the primary motivators for transfer-size is per the readme , enforcing size policies on content. in the current shape, transfer-size doesn't appear to actually perform the enforce step, deferring this behavior to the end developer in ontransferexceeded . do we know what this was? pardon if this is a redundant question . as a result of this, transfer-size seems minimally useful unless you also have the pause document api. it's unclear to me as someone that would like the control to enforce size policies why the ability to pause the document loading is not something baked in. e.g ontransferexceeded=pause without having to jump back into js to get this behavior. logging, while useful, provides questionable utility when we're talking about ads as each ad-based iframe payload can wildly vary. perhaps i guess it's useful to beacon back to analytics how often your ads are breaking their budgets?. i could see granularity/control being something we can do in a very limited way declaratively, thus a javascript api that supports doing this during runtime would make more sense. especially since pause document supports doing this for rendering, loading and script. ontransferexceeded=pause-script, pause-rendering' is likely going to be too clunky. mostly trying to understand some of the design decisions here :
