 URL : "https://github.com/vatlab/SoS/issues/805" TITLE : global section scope BODY : separated from 802 this scope issue with global often bothers me. what i usually do in research is to prototype using some local cells with loose sos statements, and after my codes are tested i put them to formal steps to execute. this inevitably involves using global variables in both inside and outside steps. with the current sos implemention i usually find myself having to define one same variable twice: one under global to let workflows use them, one as a local statement for interactive analysis. it would be great if we can make this part easier.
