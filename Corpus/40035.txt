 URL : "https://github.com/traxium/tabtree/issues/197" TITLE : tab selection broken BODY : my setup includes firefox 51.01 64bit on windows 7 x64. tab tree is very nice and was working very well until i decided to rearrange tabs in the vertical list. so i dragged a tab downward looking for the little blue line which shows where the new place was going to be. i wanted it to be in a sibling position, so i dragged the tab into place. after that, whenever i clicked on any tab it would select the tab below it. i played with the settings, hoping to change which tab gets selected when i close a tab, but it didn't help. instead things got worse. now when i click on a tab nothing happens at all. i can click on any tab at all and none of them load in the browser - it's stuck. the only thing i can do is to open the addons page from the toolbar menu and uninstall tabtree. i did this, removed all the tabtree prefs and reinstalled it and it's still broken. is there a cache file somewhere i can delete, too? i even tried using tabtree's flatten tabs function. it's completely broken. i'll have to go back to tree-style tabs if we can't get it working again!
