 URL : "https://github.com/Azure/vagrant-azure/issues/198" TITLE : pre8 nsg and interface BODY : vagrant version: vagrant 1.9.5 vagrant plugin list vagrant-azure 2.0.0.pre8 - version constraint: 2.0.0.pre8 vagrant-digitalocean 0.9.1 vagrant-docker-compose 1.3.0 vagrant-share 1.1.8, system vagrant-vbguest 0.13.0 i've tried upgrade to the pre8 version multiple times only to hit the same issue every attempt. i've remove the azure dummy box and removed pre7. i install the latest dummy box and then install pre8, following the readme instructions. the issue i'm seeing is related to the nsg not being associated with the network interface. i can vagrant ssh into the vm and see the http services running. local wget and curl requests work from an ssh session using the machine's host name. the same requests fail when attempting to use the pip fqdn to reach the same port. i've confirmed that the inbound/outbound rules required to access the port are configured. the same project works flawlessly with pre7 plugin version. any help would be appreciated as i would like to take advantage of the new optional vagrant-azure parameters to automating testing. please let me know if further information is required.
