 URL : "https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/issues/447" TITLE : description in idl BODY : firstly, thank you very much for great improvements in version 3, especially idl support, i really appreciate that! i would like to migrate my project from programmatic definition to idl. i spent quite long time with creating documentation via description in schema definitions, but i don't see a way i searched the docs how to define it via idl. is there any possibility to define it maybe i overlooked something or it's not possible? thanks a lot!
