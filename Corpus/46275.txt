 URL : "https://github.com/Kozea/Radicale/issues/649" TITLE : lost in configuration BODY : before i start, must say, that this is my first contact with radicale. i have used sabredav before. but since the development there is on hold, im in search for a alternative and found radicale. after installing radicale 2.10 its running, but currently not as deamon, it logs directly to the console. but where can i reach the webinterface? what is the principal url? can i explore something via a browser or must i use a dav client? is it possible to use 1 url to rule them all calendars and contacts ? i have nothing found to bring light in this questions, if i read the documentation.
