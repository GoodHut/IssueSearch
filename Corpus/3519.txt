 URL : "https://github.com/geneontology/go-annotation/issues/1581" TITLE : rca qc check? BODY : our docs: http://www.geneontology.org/page/rca-inferred-reviewed-computational-analysis updated november 9, 2007 > note: annotations using the rca code should be reviewed after one year, any older than this date will be deleted. > however, there's no check that implements this 'deletion rule'. i looked here: http://geneontology.org/page/annotation-quality-control-checks is there a rule in place that's missing from the documentation or is there no qc in place for this?
