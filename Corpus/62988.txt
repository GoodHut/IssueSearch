 URL : "https://github.com/hallard/DAC7565/issues/1" TITLE : dac output from 0-1.25v BODY : dear hallard, we've implemented your dac code with a dac8564, it works fine but we have one issue that we cannot figure out how to solve. your demo-code loops from 1.25-2.5 volts, and you also explicitly mention that in the comments in your code. we are not able to figure out how to use the full range of the dac, running it from 0-2.5v. is there something that we've completely missed? best regards, sebastian
