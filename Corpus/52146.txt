 URL : "https://github.com/adakoda/screenrecordex/issues/4" TITLE : cannot link executable BODY : i have tried in many devices doing your instructions huawei p9 lite, 6.0 ; lg g5; 6.0 ; nexus 4 5.1.1 ; etc. and always the problem its the same: cannot link executable: cannot locate symbol zn7android14androidruntime5startepkcs2 actually this symbol changes sometimes referenced by /data/local/tmp/screenrecordex i've read in some forums it may be because i need ld_library_path=/data/local/tmp ; but it also does not work. i think it's about the shared libraries of android which are .so files. thank you!
