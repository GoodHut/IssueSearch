 URL : "https://github.com/NBTSolutions/Leaflet.Dialog/issues/15" TITLE : css depends on bootstrap BODY : using your plugin without bootstrap css messes up the layout, since bootstrap sets box-sizing: border-box; for each element, which is not the default set by the css standard. adapting .leaflet-control-dialog .leaflet-control-dialog-inner and .leaflet-control-dialog-resizer to set box-sizing accordingly fixes this issue.
