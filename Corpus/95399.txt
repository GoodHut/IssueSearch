 URL : "https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-redmine/issues/314" TITLE : custom redmine translation BODY : i need to make some customisations in the french locale. here is what i did, let me know if there is a better way to do it: i copied the fr locale into the host: $ docker cp redmine_redmine_1:/home/redmine/redmine/config/locales/fr.yml . mounted the modified version into the container: yml services: redmine: ... volumes: - ./fr.yml:/home/redmine/redmine/config/locales/fr.yml restarted the container $ docker-compose restart redmine now i can see my modification in the container $ docker-compose exec redmine cat /home/redmine/redmine/config/locales/fr.yml | grep ... seems not to be taken into account. should i do a cache clear or something like that ? how can i do it ?
