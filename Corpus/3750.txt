 URL : "https://github.com/twigjs/twig.js/issues/504" TITLE : twig and node BODY : i have a relatively simple node app that uses twig as the template engine. the problem is that the whole logic up to the app.render takes 10-15 ms including db calls , and then it takes 35-50 ms for the template to render. the resulting html is about 100 kb large, and i don't know if the input json object's size matter i gues i can trim him down . this is more a cry for advice or optimization tips than an issue report, but i didn't know where to turn to.
