 URL : "https://github.com/challe/dotnet-core-raspberry-pi/issues/2" TITLE : libuv and 1.2.0 packages BODY : first of all many thanks for compiling all this information. you probably saved me hours! i followed your clear instructions closely and it worked like a charm except for the last step, i.e. _dotnet run_. this gave me an exception that the entry point lv_loop_size was not found in libuv. i checked my version of libuv and it was 0.10.0! i ran apt-get again but it always grabbed this version. i then downloaded the newest version from there web site and compiled it manually. after that it worked. maybe others experience the same issue. i tested on a raspberry pi 3 with ubuntu 16.04 and mate desktop. another note about the package versions: the current dotnet webapi template seems to reference packages of version 1.2.0. now, so i did not have to change anything. the runtime i installed was 2.0.0-beta-001861-00
