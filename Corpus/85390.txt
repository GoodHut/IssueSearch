BODY : hi, i love grid-styled. its really great. thank you. i wonder whether you would consider to expose display as an api? it would e.g. be nice to be able to hide boxes at certain breakpoints. js <box display={ none , block }> as an example please consider the following: i would like to display some thumbnails as a teaser, 4 for large screens, 2 for medium screens, 1 for small screens. in a react component i have: jsx renderthumbs = thumbs => { let gallery = const start = 1 const end = 4 for let i = start; i <= end; i++ { gallery.push <mybox width={ 1, 1 / 2, 1 / 4 } key={i} px={1} display={ ${i < 2 ? block : none } , ${i < 3 ? block : none } , block } > <img data-sizes= 360px src={thumbs i 0360 } classname= lazyload blur-up alt={ thumb + i} /> </mybox> } return gallery } where <mybox> is extending <box> : js import styled from styled-components import { box } from grid-styled const mybox = styled box .attrs { display: props => props.display || block } display: ${props => props.display 0 }; @media min-width: ${props => props.theme.breakpoints 0 }em { display: ${props => props.display 1 }; } @media min-width: ${props => props.theme.breakpoints 1 }em { display: ${props => props.display 2 }; } export default mybox
