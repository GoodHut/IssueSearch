 URL : "https://github.com/aio-libs/aioredis/issues/236" TITLE : pool not closed warning BODY : when finishing executing tests or any program that uses aioredis, it usually shows 2017-05-26 23:56:44,614 error asyncio 1148 | task was destroyed but it is pending! task: <task pending coro=<redispool._do_close running at /home/blck/.pyenv/versions/3.5.2/envs/aiocache/lib/python3.5/site-packages/aioredis/pool.py:117> wait_for=<future pending cb= task._wakeup >> this is basically because the pool wasn't closed before exiting and the task is still pending https://github.com/aio-libs/aioredis/blob/master/aioredis/pool.py l82 . this warning still appears even when all connections in the pool are closed because someone called clear or because there are no connections . imo the warning should appear only when the program exits while there were resources allocated i.e. connections rather than doing it by default. are you ok if i provide a mr fixing that?
