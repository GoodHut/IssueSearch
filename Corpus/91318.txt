 URL : "https://github.com/jarikomppa/escapi/issues/4" TITLE : the captured frame format BODY : i think it would be nice to update the documentation a bit, currently it does not mention the format of the returned frame. is it the same format regardless of the camera? if so, does it mean that the conversion is applied to the captured frame before the frame is returned to the user? would it make sense to allow user to specify the format of the captured frame so that we can skip the conversion to improve the capturing performance ?
