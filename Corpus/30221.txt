 URL : "https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails/issues/746" TITLE : onclick not binding BODY : help us help you! please choose one: - my app crashes with react-rails , so i've included the stack trace and the exact steps which make it crash. - x my app doesn't crash, but i'm getting unexpected behavior. so, i've described the unexpected behavior and suggested a new behavior. - i'm trying to use react-rails with another library, but i'm having trouble. i've described my javascript management setup eg, sprockets, webpack... , how i'm trying to use this other library, and why it's not working. - i have another issue to discuss. ------- i'm new to react and was following a simple tutorial for a modal component but cannot get the onclick binding to work. this is the code: javascript class app extends react.component { constructor props { super props this.state = { ismodalopen: true } } openmodal { console.log open modal ; this.setstate { ismodalopen: true } } closemodal { console.log close modal ; this.setstate { ismodalopen: false } } render { return <div> <button onclick={ => this.openmodal }>open modal</button> <modal isopen={this.state.ismodalopen} onclose={ => this.closemodal }> <h1>modal title</h1> <p>hello world</p> <p><button onclick={ => this.closemodal }>close</button></p> </modal> </div> } } i've tried it a few different ways -- with a regular function expression, with just the function with no parentheses. nothing seems to be working and its not showing up when i inspect any elements. does anyone have any idea what the issue is? i've searched around for other's with this problem but none of their solutions did anything.
