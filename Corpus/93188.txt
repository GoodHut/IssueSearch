 URL : "https://github.com/phpipam/phpipam/issues/1567" TITLE : add ip not in subnet range BODY : hello, so i setup phpipam and im quite happy with it. after importing all my subnets and ips i realized, that there was one missing, which lead to me trying to add it manually. the ip is not actually in the subnet range, but we routed it so the connection works. when i try to add it manually following error appears, which kinda makes sense: ip address is not in the selected subnet! 80.248.xxx.xxx the funny thing is, when i import the ip it works fine. is there a workaround or do i have to import all the ips not in range? kinda annoying when i just want to add 1-2 ips thanks in advance il3ctro
