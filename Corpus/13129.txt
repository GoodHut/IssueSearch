 URL : "https://github.com/s1ddok/Fiber2D/issues/11" TITLE : swift and kotlin BODY : i just want to talk about swift and it's future. first rumors was like google want to make it first class lang: https://thenextweb.com/dd/2016/04/07/google-facebook-uber-swift/ currently for cross-platform game development i'm using cocos2d-x and c++, which is supported by platform ide's: xcode and android studio. this gives me a top level of controll and i can easy use any new features in these ide's. overall like i can say - ability to work natively. this is really cool. but what is not cool, it's c++. it's fast, powerful but it's not easy to learn it and overall it's too complicated.. so, i waited for swift to be official on android maybe.. but what do we have now: kotlin is now an official android language. https://developer.android.com/kotlin/index.html https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/05/android-announces-support-for-kotlin.html swift is like kotlin. or better to say vice versa? kotlin first appeared at 2011, but swift at 2014. well, whatever.. and fun to compare some syntax of both languages: http://nilhcem.com/swift-is-like-kotlin/ anyway, this means no way for swift for android . i don't believe that google has any plans for it. finally, looks like c++ is only the one right way.. and we have cocos2d-x, but they currently moving into wrong direction - to js. also, they developing closed-source editor, same crappy as was android studio. for me it's like china low quality product . any ideas, thought about all this?
