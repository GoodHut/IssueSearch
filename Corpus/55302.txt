 URL : "https://github.com/colh99/apush-compass/issues/2" TITLE : info boxes not showing BODY : i am using this tutorial https://websitebeaver.com/how-to-make-an-interactive-and-responsive-svg-map-of-us-states-capitals and i'm having issues with the jquery part under the subheader displaying states & capitals of the tutorial , getting the info box to show up. i have no knowledge of jquery, and after reading carefully through the tutorial, lots of googling and trying various things, i am completely stuck. one thing i have noticed is that when i hit f12 to view the sources, the javascript js file doesn't show up, so it may have to do with how i've linked to the jquery code. any help/suggestions are very much appreciated, thank you! and sorry, my code/files are probably a bit messy :/
