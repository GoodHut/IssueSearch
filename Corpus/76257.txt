 URL : "https://github.com/pombase/website/issues/292" TITLE : involved in, involved in BODY : i was sure i opened a ticket about this last week, but apparently not.... so sometimes we link a mf term to 2 processes. when we link functions to processes, or processes to processes, we use the relationship part_of. becasue when we first began doing this, we were only connecting only functions to processes mf involved in process sounds fine. nowe we have things like mf involved in process involved in process for example pom1 protein serine/threonine kinase activity directly inhibits cdr2 involved in negative regulation of protein localization to cell tip involved in signal transduction involved in g2 cell size control checkpoint which means pom1 protein kinase inhibits cdr2. it is involved in negative regulation of protein localization to cell tip as part of signal transduction involved in g2 cell size control checkpoint so we only join when one of the processes is part of the other and go will not let us precompose. i wonder if, for the display label for the involved ins linking processes the display label part of would be better? does protein serine/threonine kinase activity directly inhibits cdr2 involved in negative regulation of protein localization to cell tip as part_of in signal transduction involved in g2 cell size control checkpoint @antonialock @mah11
