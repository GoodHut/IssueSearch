 URL : "https://github.com/CDSoft/pp/issues/17" TITLE : add powershell support BODY : i think it would be a worth adding support for powershell via a built in macro !ps , !powershell or !posh as an alternative to !cmd . powershell is way more powerful and flexible compared to cmd, and ships with many unix like commands ls , etc. , and there are lots of third party scripts availabe to emulate linux commands touch , etc. . this could simplify creating cross-platform macros because it would allow to use some common commands syntax ie: and ls command would also work with !ps , unlike !cmd requiring dir . powershell scripts are less clancky and more user friendly than batch files, and — most important — the powershell environment doesn't suffer from the lack of full unicode/utf8 compliance as the cmd does many commands break up unicode in piping operations, as not all cmd commands are fully unicode compliant yet, and there is the usual page encoding nightmare .
