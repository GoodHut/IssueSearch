 URL : "https://github.com/cr-api/cr-api/issues/29" TITLE : api error pages BODY : it would be great if we can have a collection of sample error pages that will be returned by the api. make them always available if possible. .e.g. api.cr-api.com/error/tag-not-found or whatever you decide is best. at the moment, there is no way for me to reliably test error handling except when it happens. and having these pages available would allow me to deal with every single scenario, e.g. - profile tag not found - clan tag not found - api down - etc etc
