 URL : "https://github.com/dbcli/mycli/issues/473" TITLE : completions in lowercase BODY : is it posible to reconfigure mycli somehow i think somewhere within the .py files site-packages/mycli to suggest autocompletions in lowercase than all uppercase? i only type in lowercase and am very used to it as all uppercase letters hurt my eyes :- thanks for the attention.
