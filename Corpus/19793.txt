 URL : "https://github.com/cpriest/SnapLinksPlus/issues/171" TITLE : adding extra links BODY : when on my profile on https://eggcave.com , the selection will sometimes believe there are more links than there actually are. you can see here http://i364.photobucket.com/albums/oo86/thaliel/eggcave_zpsvwyqj111.png that although there should only be 12 links, it says 13, the 13th being a completely unrelated site that is being opened additonally to the 12 links selected
