 URL : "https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/848" TITLE : .net core 2.0 msi BODY : hi, is there an msi version of .net core 2.0 sdk or, preferably, windowshosting available? if not -- why not? many legacy distribution systems still use msi as the primary and sometimes only method of distribution. i understand that we can build msi ourselves from the provided zip archives, but maybe you should consider adding msi builds to the official distribution. thank you.
