BODY : hey, i was just doing some stuff with delannoy numbers https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/delannoy_number when i noticed that neighborhoods usually include the center cell. from wikipedia: > the moore neighbourhood of a cell is the cell itself and the cells at a chebyshev distance of 1. > the von neumann neighbourhood of a cell is the cell itself and the cells at a manhattan distance of 1. i understand that the center cell doesn't usually hold much value when working with neighborhoods, but it may be a good idea to include it for accuracy. thoughts?
