 URL : "https://github.com/google/pulldown-cmark/issues/106" TITLE : how to enumerate headings? BODY : is there a way to enumerate headings in the rendered html? i was thinking about using something similar to the examples in the readme, counting headings in each level and adding something to headings inside the rendered html, but maybe there is already some undocumented option like: let mut opts = options::empty ; opts.insert pulldown_cmark::option_enable_tables ;
