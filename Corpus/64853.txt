BODY : hi, i'm trying to rename options for variants with api since a few days and i don't found the solution ... a shopify employee busfox 👍 gives me this code : with a put request { product : { options : { name : color , position :1, values : rose , dark red }, { name : device , position :1, values : iphone 7 , iphone 7 plus } } } and it works when you have an only one option, but if i have two or three options, le name is never changing. the problem is the key, if i have an only one option and no key, the array is rewrited and it's updating the name, so it works. but if i have more of one option, i must add a key to my call, like this : $optionsarray $key = array name => $value, position => 1, values => $optionsvalues ; $data = array 'product' => array 'options' => $optionsarray ; any idea to help me ? is it a bug? or is it me that has a bug ? thx !
