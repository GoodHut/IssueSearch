 URL : "https://github.com/hypriot/rpi-crate/issues/2" TITLE : is crate for arm dead BODY : please has this repo been abandoned ? this is a seamless database project that takes a different approach to database . you started adapting it to arm , which is a very wonderful thing. please could you try to keep it. cratedb https://github.com/crate/crate/ takes a unique concept to data storage which requires a new learning curve and rpi offers a lower barrier of trying new techs. i think the x86 version now runs on alpine base image, if that is achieved in arm will be more awsome.
