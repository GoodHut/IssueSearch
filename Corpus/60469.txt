 URL : "https://github.com/tomcourt/enguino/issues/16" TITLE : 3d printed enguino case BODY : i'm imagining two pieces. the main piece is an open box the boards would drop into. it would have cutouts for ethernet, usb and the power plug on one side. the main piece would have ears extending from the outside on the bottom would be used for screw mounting to a panel. 4 studs on top of shallow bushings on the bottom of the inside of the box would slightly raise the boards and restrict them moving around. the studs could be snap style pieces if the 'tilt in' can be successfully navigated when dropping the board in. the second piece is a cover with cutouts for the aux display and pressure sensors and openings on either side for wires. it keeps the boards from tilting up by clamping on the top of the terminal blocks. it would either ratchet along steps in the open box, screw to it or possibly zip ties would secure it. note - a custom shield board will likely change the dimensions of the case. and it will certainly change the mounting solutions available.
