 URL : "https://github.com/opentrials/opentrials/issues/708" TITLE : add filter by source BODY : add a filter that allows people picking which sources they'd want to search for. for the ui, you can use a similar implementation as the autocomplete boxes, but that doesn't allow writing new values i.e. can only use valid names . there's an endpoint on https://api.opentrials.net/v1/sources to get all of our sources, but be aware that not all sources are trial sources. we have things like fda , which shouldn't appear in this list. we might need to change our api responses to develop this feature. please analyse the issue and write a proposal on the solution before developing it.
