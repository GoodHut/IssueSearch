 URL : "https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/issues/1643" TITLE : omnibusf4 firmware bug. BODY : i've confirmed this on two different flight controller boards and everything works fine in cleanflight, so i believe it is a bug that was introduced in the inav fork. i can confirm this behavior in 1.6, 1.6.1 and 1.7. using betaflight and cleanflight, i can move my sticks on the transmitter and see the channels respond as expected. when i flash with inav using the same configs, i don’t see the channels respond in inav configurator, like i do in betaflight and cleanflight. here’s what i’m using: - flip 32 f4 omnibus http://www.readytoflyquads.com/flip-32---f4---omnibus-v3 - x4r receiver - taranis x9d transmitter i even ordered another flight controller http://www.2dogrc.com/omnibus-f4-pro-v4-pdb-fc-in-one-smart-audio-support.html but get the same result.
