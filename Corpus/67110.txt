 URL : "https://github.com/fragilefamilieschallenge/codalab-competitions/issues/9" TITLE : ordering of leaderboard BODY : the default leaderboard in codalab assigns higher ranks to higher scores so that the highest score is given rank 1 . i think we would like to reverse this; our scores are mean squared error, so the best submission should be the one with the lowest score. is this possible to change?
