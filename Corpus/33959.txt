 URL : "https://github.com/thorsten/phpMyFAQ/issues/1396" TITLE : better pdf rendering BODY : hello, tcpdf rendering is quite awful with table as you can see below : ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29979292/33941116-b9ce80ee-e011-11e7-99b1-6231777b0594.png i think tcpdf is quite limited for good rendering. i think the best solution would be to render a pdf from what's displayed on the current page. maybe wkhtmltopdf library can be implemented in future release ? regards fab
