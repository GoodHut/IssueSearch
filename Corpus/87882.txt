 URL : "https://github.com/michaelrsweet/mxml/issues/209" TITLE : memory leak in mxmldelete BODY : it seems there is a memory leak in mxmldelete. to reproduce the issue one can run a code like: mxml_node_t tree = mxmlloadstring null, <?xml version=\ 1.0\ ?><root><nt></nt></root> , mxml_no_callback ; mxmldelete tree ; visual studio will show a memory leak. it seems replacing else if next = temp->next == null { if next = temp->parent == node next = null; } with else next = temp; will resolve the leak.
