 URL : "https://github.com/askomics/docker-galaxy-askomics/issues/2" TITLE : support for proxy_prefix BODY : askomics docker should have a proxy_prefix env var that make it work properly when it runs behind a proxy. e.g. when it's accessed at http://somewhere/gie_proxy/askomics/ when used as a galaxy ie behind an nginx proxy the current workaround is to add a specific proxy_pass/proxy_redirect rule in the nginx proxy. this is ugly.
