 URL : "https://github.com/cmangos/classic-db/issues/26" TITLE : covert ops: alpha/beta BODY : hello yet again with another brainstorm for finishing this script. it is to my understanding that this script has never been done before on any private server or any public codebase. since this is 2. on my short vanilla to-do list, here we go: http://www.wowhead.com/quest=1079/covert-ops-alpha http://www.wowhead.com/quest=1080/covert-ops-beta each quest gives http://www.wowhead.com/item=5738/covert-ops-pack which needs conditions to reward correct loot based on quest taken, to prevent doubling items etc. then there we have the actual looted items: 5692 5693 5694 5695 5737 and they cast spells: 6626,6656,6630,6627 all spells trigger events: 694 691 693 692 two of those events spawn two gos: 19592,19601 which act as spell focuses for the two remaining events. last but not least, the last two spells should in some way redirect the mobs around the respective plans. problem is to find a credible source of which mobs , let alone correct spawns . i will do this one myself, should anyone wish to research more and gather evidence for this behaviour, feel free to do so. when i have enough i will script it and export it just like before.
