 URL : "https://github.com/philipmat/discogs-xml2db/issues/89" TITLE : fix xml while importing BODY : at the moment the fix-xml script has to be run before starting the import process. the only thing this script does is to remove some characters. i was wondering if this could be done while importing the file. the main advantage for me would be that i need less free disk space to run the program. the fix-xml stage is the step that takes up the most disk space as it copies the files while doing the substitutions. since the latest releases file is 33gib i need at least 66gib of free space for this step, which is a lot on my cramped ssd. additionally this would simplify the importing process by removing one step.
