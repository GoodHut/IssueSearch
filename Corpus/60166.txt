 URL : "https://github.com/fifafu/BetterTouchTool/issues/1252" TITLE : window resize shortcut BODY : hey, the last few version it seems that this feature sometimes worked and sometimes did not: shortcut: command-option move mouse = resize window hovered on also ctrl-option-move mouse - move window hovered over but now it seems to work less often and when it doesn't work all my other shortcuts stop working including magic mouse shortcuts. so there is some kind of issue here, just letting you know. btw, this is the most useful app, i was happy to pay for it immediately the moment you started charging. really good work. affected input device e.g. macbook trackpad, magic mouse/trackpad, touch bar, etc. : keyboard, magic mouse, not tested on trackpad device information: type of mac: macbook air 13 mid 2012 macos version: 10.11.6 el capitan bettertouchtool version: 2.270 658
