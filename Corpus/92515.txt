 URL : "https://github.com/USCiLab/cereal/issues/435" TITLE : xml and std::vector<char> BODY : luckily xml has real char types in contrast to json 310 . however std::vector<char> is serialised to xml <value1 size= dynamic > <value0>a</value0> <value1>c</value1> <value2>a</value2> <value3>c</value3> <value4>a</value4> <value5>c</value5> <value6>a</value6> <value7>c</value7> <value8>a</value8> <value9>c</value9> <value10>a</value10> <value11>a</value11> <value12>t</value12> <value13>t</value13> <value14>a</value14> <value15>t</value15> </value1> while std::string is serialised to: <value2>acacacacacaattat</value2> obviously the second is much more space efficient and also easier to read. could you change for the standard containers+char to serialise like string in xml? thanks! ps: i don't know if this change could be made without breaking compatibility ðŸ˜°
