 URL : "https://github.com/mllg/checkmate/issues/114" TITLE : qassert in rcpp BODY : i am beginning to use cm to check args in my rcpp function code. 1 it is really great that this works, in principle. 2 imho the example in the vignette should be extended, or rather: there should be a concrete, longer example. one thing that might be confusing to some people is that you now have to work with sexps in your signature, i think, instead of letting rcpp already convert to the native c++ type. that would be clearly visible from a full example. 3 matrices seem a bit less supported? can i eg check for dims? or other stuff?
