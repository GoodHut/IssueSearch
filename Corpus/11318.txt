 URL : "https://github.com/thewca/worldcubeassociation.org/issues/1653" TITLE : get rid of phpbb BODY : there are 2 things blocking this: 1. have some way to display the legacy forum content. @jonatanklosko is working on this in pr 1651. 2. give the wdc posting privileges. they need a few features before they are able to use this: - an option to not display posts on the homepage - a tagging feature for posts - a page where you can view posts of a particular tag. something like /posts/wdc to view all posts tagged wdc .
