 URL : "https://github.com/ngageoint/elasticgeo/issues/51" TITLE : ssl for elasticgeo BODY : hi, i'm trying to incorporate this plugin for our project. however, our project requires an https not http connection with a cert and a key. because of this, the elasticdatastore constructor is crashing on line 102 since an http connection won't work for us: https://github.com/ngageoint/elasticgeo/blob/master/gt-elasticsearch/src/main/java/mil/nga/giat/data/elasticsearch/elasticdatastore.java. is there support for https in elasticgeo? if so, please let me know how to input my cert, key, and https url. thanks.
