 URL : "https://github.com/Thibaut/devdocs/issues/633" TITLE : show images offline BODY : <!-- please read the contributing guidelines before opening an issue: https://github.com/thibaut/devdocs/blob/master/contributing.md to request a new documentation, or an update of an existing documentation, go here: https://trello.com/b/6bmtulfx/devdocs-documentation --> currently, images are directly referenced in documentations. unfortunately, this causes them to not show up when the device is offline. one possibility would be to transform the image urls into data: urls for the offline download
