 URL : "https://github.com/LLK/scratch-gui/issues/683" TITLE : blocks - add more effects BODY : scratch currently has a few effects - ghost, whirl, colour, fisheye, pixelate, mosaic, and brightness. mostly though, only ghost, brightness, and maybe colour are useful for most projects. however, because scratch 3 is being made in html5, there are a lot of possibilities to implement more effects. the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/api/canvasrenderingcontext2d/filter url canvas filter supports the same effects and more as the css filter, so i see an opportunity to add: blur effect invert colour effect saturation effect
