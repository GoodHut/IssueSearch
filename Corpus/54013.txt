 URL : "https://github.com/pemani/freejamming/issues/5" TITLE : feature request review BODY : adding the option for the user to preview a track before adding it to the playlist will improve the user's experience and interface. request preview_url like the other data points for tracks in spotify.search . it would be easier to set preview_url as a state. whenever a mouseenter is triggered, we would use setstate to change preview_url to that of the track. could have left some more details about the technical design. great feature request.
