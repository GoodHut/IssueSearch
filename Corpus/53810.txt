 URL : "https://github.com/CalcProgrammer1/KeyboardVisualizer/issues/137" TITLE : eta til matrix update? BODY : not really an issue, but this is the closest thing to a comments section i could find. was just wondering when you plan on getting a full release version of the matrix update out? i finally got my esps working en-masse and now i really want to get a good matrix board set up. also, how does the matrix work? does it have the same effect as a keyboard? thanks in advance.
