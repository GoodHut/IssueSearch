 URL : "https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/5588" TITLE : node 1.35 package broken BODY : i'm not sure what happens, but the node package for 1.35 is broken, it looks like it's missing some files and has extra files that shouldn't be included. it's possible something in our build steps changed and this is my fault, but we should fix it either way. i'll get on it and we'll publish a 1.35.1
