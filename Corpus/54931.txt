 URL : "https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/838" TITLE : hunspell doesn't start BODY : @localhost:~ $ hunspell can't open affix or dictionary files for dictionary named en_us . @localhost:~ 1 $ apt list | grep hunspell warning: apt does not have a stable cli interface. use with caution in scripts. hunspell/stable,now 1.6.0 aarch64 installed hunspell-dev/stable 1.6.0 aarch64 hunspell-en-us/stable,now 2017.03.03 all installed it worked fine before, though telling you when exactly did it stop would be a problem. as you can see, the dictionary is installed, and i just reinstalled them both just in case. no dice. setting dicpath=/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/share/hunspell does not improve the situation.
