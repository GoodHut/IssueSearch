 URL : "https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues/11662" TITLE : icon request: icon-imdb-b BODY : i would like to please request an additional imdb icon alongside the existing one. i've titled this request as icon-imdb-b simply to differentiate it from the existing imdb icon, fa-imdb. as the existing one has white text with a black background, i would like to be able to have a text-only version with black text, as previously noted in 9378. on my site, i have facebook fa-facebook , instagram fa-instagram , vimeo fa-vimeo and youtube fa-youtube icons, with imdb in the middle, but the current icon does not look uniform with the rest, hence why i would like a variant imdb icon. currently, i have decided to instead use stackicons for the imdb icon obviously an inefficient workaround , and this more simple design is what i would like added to font awesome, if at all possible. example of my request image from stackicons : ! icon-imdb-b https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8655939/31908544-c1997216-b893-11e7-9cbf-97dd0624d9a2.jpg
