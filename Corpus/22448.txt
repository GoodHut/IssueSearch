 URL : "https://github.com/Armadill0/harbour-tasklist/issues/86" TITLE : less exposed lists BODY : tasklist is very addictive. number of my lists only grows. although i am starting to observe a scalability issue. due to a growing number of lists both cover and in the app navigation through lists is getting tedious. i have been watching this usage pattern and it happened to me that it would nice to be able to mark seldom used lists as less visible. ie. daily used lists would be first tier. they would be automatically visible as part of cover navigation and as next > next > next in app navigation. while lists seldom used fe. a checklist one uses every couple of weeks, months, etc. could be marked as available only from list listing view - manage lists .
