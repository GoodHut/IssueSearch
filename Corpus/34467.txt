 URL : "https://github.com/dblock/slack-market/issues/44" TITLE : charts not appearing BODY : recently last few days charts stopped appearing in the bot responses. the 1d 1m 1y options are there still. the chart option is not turned off. new posts have a missing chart block. existing posts now have a slack image error. this may be the result of a change in the yahoo finance api. http://imgur.com/a/vltsf
