 URL : "https://github.com/Avicus/Issues/issues/1220" TITLE : walls don't drop BODY : this may be an issue on only one map but it seems that the walls do not drop when the timer runs out on the walls server. thought i'd bring it up as we'd probably want that fixed asap as players are often moved to the walls server while other servers restart.
