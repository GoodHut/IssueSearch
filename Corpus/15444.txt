 URL : "https://github.com/koute/stdweb/issues/56" TITLE : drag and drop api BODY : i want to use the html drag and drop api https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/api/html_drag_and_drop_api . i'm guessing that like geolocation https://github.com/koute/stdweb/issues/34 this just needs an implementation added. i think to do this i need to implement - dragevent https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/api/dragevent , it should sit under mouseevent the same way mouseevent sits under uievent . - drag https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/events/drag , dragend https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/events/dragend , dragenter https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/events/dragenter , dragexit https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/events/dragexit , dragleave https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/events/dragleave , dragover https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/events/dragover , dragstart https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/events/dragstart , and drop https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/events/dragstart as concreteevent s like clickevent is. - datatransfer https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/api/datatransfer , datatransferitem https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/api/datatransferitem , and datatransferitemlist https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/api/datatransferitemlist in a way reasonably similar to filelist . is this all correct and would a pull request be welcome? if so i will start working on it.
