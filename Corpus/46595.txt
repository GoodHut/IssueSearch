 URL : "https://github.com/alibaba/react-intl-universal/issues/2" TITLE : mirror react-intl api BODY : first, thanks for creating this package! i've been looking for something similar ever since i started using react-intl . as the documentation suggests this package as an replacement to react-intl , it would be really nice if it would provide the same api https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl/wiki/api as the injected intl object. so instead of formatting a message with javascript intl.get 'simple' it would use the same api as react-intl javascript intl.formatmessage {id: 'simple'} this would make it a lot easier for existing users of react-intl to transition to this package.
