 URL : "https://github.com/5calls/5calls/issues/341" TITLE : web impact doesn't add up BODY : a user reports: i did fill out the section saying i've made contact, left message, etc. when i look at my impact it says i made 6 calls and 0 for all the other parts...why is that? so it sounds like the impact pages says you've made 6 calls but no other stats around how many were contact/vm/etc. i haven't heard this from anyone else yet, for investigation.
