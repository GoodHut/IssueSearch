 URL : "https://github.com/nikulukani/pyorient_native/issues/3" TITLE : date encoding issue BODY : the pyorient unit test test_binary_date tests.test_serializations.serializationtestcase is failing. the returned date for me is a day off. i narrowed this down to the mktime/gmtime pair in encoding/decoding. mktime expects a local time and gmtime a utc time. supposedly it's not portable, but i wrote a little test program, and adding this to the structure passed to mktime seems to work better: c++ t.tm_isdst = -1; time_t now = time 0 ; t.tm_sec += difftime now, 0 - difftime mktime gmtime &now , 0 ;
