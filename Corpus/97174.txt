BODY : i know what you're thinking. you're probably thinking hey buddy.. theres already a discussion about this . but thats not entirely true. you see, the other discussion mentioned using the twitch app to get minecraft mods. theres just one tiny problem: i havent found a linux version of this app. how do i proceed? should i cast my computer into a fiery abyss? should i spill the blood of the ancients and hope a dark disturbing ritual gets foolcraft working on my computer? tl;dr, if forge is our only option, how do we forge to see the mod? if there is a better way than using the dumb twitch app for babies? hope to get this thing working. i'll update if the ritual works... or if i figure it out.
