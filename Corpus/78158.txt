 URL : "https://github.com/minetest/minetest/issues/5739" TITLE : player texture brightens BODY : it's a bug that many people experienced already. the player's texture becomes brighter and brighter. i thought, a mod would cause it but no. probably this also happens with any other entity. normally the brightening effect should wear off after ~1 second. but if you get much times damage at once eg. from many mobs or radiation , it doesn't. https://github.com/minetest/minetest/blob/master/src/content_cao.cpp l1759 https://github.com/minetest/minetest/blob/master/src/content_cao.cpp l1311
