 URL : "https://github.com/nuxsmin/sysPass/issues/584" TITLE : profiles: default group BODY : this is a quick request for a default group option in profiles. every time i create a user, i have to select both a profile and a group, while the group is, for example, admins and the profile name is admin . it would be great if i would only have to select a profile for a new account, instead of selecting both admin and the group admins .
