 URL : "https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15724" TITLE : removing heredoc idents BODY : i'm trying to use heredoc syntax with terraform v0.10.0 specifically with hopes of the hanging indents being removed as outlined in this hcl commit https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl/pull/91/commits . terraform seems to recognize the <<-heredoc syntax, but only find the terminator and does not strip the indent from inside. have the hcl changes been fully incorporated to my version?
