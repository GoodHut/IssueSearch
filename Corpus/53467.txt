 URL : "https://github.com/psifidotos/Latte-Dock/issues/574" TITLE : drag & drop suggestion BODY : hi, when i try drag a file, for example from dolphin to inkscape or from dolphin to firefox to loading an image in google images, for example , the target application doesn't raise up automatically when i drag with the mouse to the dock and therefore i can't complete the drop. this is the normal behavior in all panels i know lxpanel, xfcepanel, mate-panel, even kde panel but not in latte dock. it would be great if you could incorporate this feature. thanks in advance.
