 URL : "https://github.com/jeffreycwitt/tei-web-editor/issues/15" TITLE : full unicode support BODY : i guess this might be more of a feature request than a proper bug report but full unicode support would be necessary even for most european languages written in latin script. i have had a brief look at the html source and it seems this might be a display issue that can be solved by simply adding the appropriate meta tag <meta charset= utf-8 /> . i would also like to express my gratitude for this impressive effort at building an web editor for tei. thank you!
