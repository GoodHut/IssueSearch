 URL : "https://github.com/Deletescape-Media/Lawnchair/issues/282" TITLE : internal icon picker sucks BODY : 1.some icons would be neglected when there's a space in those names. 2.need an alphabetic ordered scroll bar, like the drawer. 3.why not give an alt, like nova launcher does, to use the native picker of icon packs? just put a button on the top bar of the internal picker.
