 URL : "https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-frontend/issues/212" TITLE : language choice broken BODY : looking at http://map.project-osrm.org/ using firefox. when i hover over the us flag in the bottom left corner, more flags open to the right, all of them except one us flags. most flags can't be accessed because they seem to be under the km/mile marker. when i click on the germany flag i get an empty browser window, but changing the hl=en to hl=de in the url works. also http://www.flagsarenotlanguages.com . @freenerd
