 URL : "https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/1501" TITLE : docker push timeouts BODY : after installing the latest sierra update, a docker push to my private repos on docker hub timeouts with the error: dial tcp: lookup auth.docker.io on 192.168.65.1:53: read udp 192.168.65.2:56033->192.168.65.1:53: i/o timeout expected behavior: docker push <repo>/<image>:latest pushes the image to docker hub actual behavior: pushing layers < 100mb will upload and then rather than display pushed status will reset/retry. layers > 100mb will stall. eventually the command error exits with the error message above. information build: 17.03.1-ce-mac5 16048 diagnostic id: 9ee99567-6f59-471b-a9e1-3d7f65d4125b b18e2a50c macos: version 10.12.4 build: 16e195 logs: /tmp/9ee99567-6f59-471b-a9e1-3d7f65d4125b/20170401-134024.tar.gz ok vmnetd ok dns ok driver.amd64-linux ok virtualization vt-x ok app ok moby ok system ok moby-syslog ok db ok env ok virtualization kern.hv_support ok slirp ok osxfs ok moby-console ok logs ok docker-cli ok menubar ok disk additional info this issue has has been a minor annoyance since installing docker for mac. however, running the docker push command in succession 2 or 3 attempts after failure would eventually push the image up. however, since installing the latest docker for mac build and the latest sierra update, i am no longer able to update my private images.
