 URL : "https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/issues/7955" TITLE : database integrity check BODY : please consider adding a database integrity check tool. eventhough it's mentioned that you shouldn't do any direct manipulations with database, sometimes you just doesn't have any other option. so it would be nice to have a cli tool for integrity check. most mature projects involving sql have them. personal example: team statistics tab shows nothing, but endless loading... . no exceptions in the log, so i just can't find what is wrong with it.
