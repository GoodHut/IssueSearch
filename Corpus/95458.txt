BODY : https://github.com/tinyanvil/tiny-money-webpack/blob/0709bf5836abb2a1a1cac58950655dafb5947abb/js/root/root.js l9 hey @tyvdh i've never used vue before so i'm just getting situated with it, but i noticed that data here is a pojo rather than a function. based on this part of the docs https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html data-must-be-a-function it feels like it should be a function. thoughts?
