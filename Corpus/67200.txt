 URL : "https://github.com/leoluk/configmaster/issues/11" TITLE : parallelize task runner BODY : the task runner already has multi-process locking for all all shared resources, so most of the hard work is already done. you can run it multiple times with different sets of devices or groups, which scales really well. all that's left to do is to automatically distribute tasks over a number of workers.
