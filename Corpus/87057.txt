 URL : "https://github.com/MergeMyPullRequest/order-splitter/issues/2" TITLE : introduce react framework BODY : would be nice to have a ui framework to help with development and aesthetics. react seems cool. there's a section in the docs entitled adding react to an existing application https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html adding-react-to-an-existing-application . the installation docs say that we can try out react without having to set up a whole build pipeline. maybe, for starters, we shouldn't worry about getting jsx to work just yet.
