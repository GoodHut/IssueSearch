 URL : "https://github.com/Quasilyte/benchstat.el/issues/4" TITLE : take gc time into account BODY : it needs some investigation, but it seems like benchmark-run does not return total execution time in list head. benchstat.el profiles currently ignore time spent in gc as third list value is ignored. before submitting a fix, i should be sure that simple addition is appropriate. note: documentation for benchmark-run return value is misleading. > return a list of the total elapsed time for execution, the number of > garbage collections that ran, and the time taken by garbage collection. > see also ‘benchmark-run-compiled’.
