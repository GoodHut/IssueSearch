 URL : "https://github.com/epics-base/pvDatabaseCPP/issues/29" TITLE : build issue on macos BODY : hi marty, please take a look at the aps jenkins build log for macos https://jenkins.aps.anl.gov/view/epics%20v4/job/epics-pvdatabase-mac/lastbuild/console , where the build is failing. michael says he has seen this particular error before, which only occurs on the mac and is due to a mis-match of a base class and derived class in the assignment statement on src/pvaccess/channelproviderlocal.cpp line 46. i'm going to guess that there are other examples like this that might give you a clue what needs changing i don't know the answer myself . thanks â€“ andrew
