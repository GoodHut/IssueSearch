 URL : "https://github.com/rbreier/TheCellar/issues/31" TITLE : your documentation sucks! BODY : i'm trying to dockerize this. why? i'm getting pretty good with containers, but i want to try to containerize something that is way outside my area of expertise. can you update your docs to describe how someone can go from zero to running? specifically what your app needs in terms of configuration in order to run. thanks!
