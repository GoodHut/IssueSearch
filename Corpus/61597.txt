 URL : "https://github.com/japaric/criterion.rs/issues/103" TITLE : benchmarking within src BODY : hi, i have a project that has benchmark test in src/fow/bar/bench.rs so that it can test private items in src/fow/bar/mod.rs i try to convert to criterion, but did not find documentation on how to set up this use case. i am ok weather this is easy, hard, or not doable, but whichever it is it should be documented.
