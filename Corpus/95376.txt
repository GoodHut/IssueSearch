 URL : "https://github.com/ericaddison/Parallel_Algs_Term_Project/issues/4" TITLE : cuda fft and 2^15 elements BODY : when i run the test script to generate runtimes and compare outputs from numpy fft and my cuda fft, the comparison script shows good agreement relative rms error ~1e-12 for number of elements equal to all powers of 2 up to 24 except for 2^15. for some unknown reason, there is sizeable error in the cuda result when i set n = 2 15 ... i haven't dug into this yet, and probably won't get to it before the project is due...
