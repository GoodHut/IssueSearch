 URL : "https://github.com/FIX94/Nintendont/issues/513" TITLE : wiiu inject inquiry BODY : if this is in the wrong place, please let me know. wiiu gc injects can load the autoboot forwarder so nintendont will load the game after it sets things up. part of that setup surely includes initializing the usb for stuff like the gamecube adapter. i'm wondering if a wii inject can enact a similar process so that the gc adapter is allowed for wii games like mario sunshine?
