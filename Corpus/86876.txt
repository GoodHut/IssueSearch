 URL : "https://github.com/openshiftio/openshift.io/issues/1552" TITLE : inaccessible stack report BODY : i am using the default java wildfly swarm demo and got the following report: ! codebases https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/296354/33766459-cf37cfdc-dc1d-11e7-8ffb-3b1e8d6dab7e.png except show complete stack report nothing is linkd. i would expect that analyzed: 2 | unknown: 2 are links, either to the relevant section in the report or at least providing some context what it actually meant by components . also, i would export unkown licenses 3 to be a link to these three unknown licenses or to the relevant section of the report. funny enough, even on the full report, i am still not able to work out what these unknown licenses are. also, the demo code itself is apache license 2.0. does this mean, this is a recursive license scan? in this case one would need to know which transitive dependencies are involved.
