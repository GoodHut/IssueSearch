 URL : "https://github.com/Arlen22/TiddlyServer/issues/21" TITLE : integration into a website BODY : hi, i have a website that is developed out using node.js. i would like to add the wiki in a subdirectory, say http://myweb.com/blog, as a read-only sub to the main site. i am currently editing the tw via the node.js tiddlywiki module run locally. i just want to be able to copy the directory over to the public server and have it available online. as the public site is already running node is there anyway i can simply detect the /blog route using express and send the request to a tw node module to handle the display? i would like it to be under the same domain for simplicity and seo purposes. if it can't run on a sub-path i wonder if it could be implemented as a sub-process or a fork sharing the port with the master.
