 URL : "https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public/issues/145" TITLE : fast p k,z access BODY : dear class support, i would like to gain on the speed of p k,z computations which is too low by default and wonder how to do that efficiently so i have a few questions: - is it possible to specify externally the k node values used ?. is there a dedicated function for that? is it good idea? it may depend interpolation scheme used - is a call to pk vec k,z faster than individual p k_i,z ones? -there is a z_max_pk that i set : is there a z_min_pk one? -how is performed the p k,z evolution in z? in which part of the code? any other idea? thanks, my best stephane
