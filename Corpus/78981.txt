 URL : "https://github.com/McJty/RFTools/issues/1364" TITLE : request shield generator BODY : i would like to ask to make the shield projector opaque so that it renders the blocks next too it. i ask cuz i made custom model for it and now it looks a bit weird. furthermore its not really a building block so it shouldn't make difference in performance. it could be a config option too. anyway thanks for your time. a friendly supporter
