 URL : "https://github.com/zapta/linbus/issues/24" TITLE : lin bus rate BODY : hello, i have tried your project on arduino uno board, and it works perfectly fine. i have two problems: 1. when my lin master sends a frame header without data , and i print out the frame id, i always get some garbage data on sio before the id which is detected correctly . what could be the reason for this? 2. when i send lin messages fast from an scheduler thread , i get sync error. what is the fastest that the code can receive new frame header after sending data or better how can one measure this? cheers, s
