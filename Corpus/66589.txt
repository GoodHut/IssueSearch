 URL : "https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-validation/issues/382" TITLE : namespace the i18n keys BODY : i know this was somewhat discussed 1 before, and there are probably not many people who are bothered by this, but i figured i would post here anyway. the fact that you are adding i18n keys to the already existing errors namespace causes problems for me 3 . as far as i could see in other gems - for example devise - it is common for a gem to put their i18n keys under their own root namespace 2 . also - to give a little context - i should mention that i am not using dry-validations at all, and the gem was installed indirectly for me by the config gem - so from my point of view, its a feature i am not using, and is causing some issues in my codebase, and i have no way of removing, other than to stop using the config gem. i guess my suggestion is - if at all possible - is to namespace your i18n keys under some dry_validations: root node. 1 : https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-validation/issues/31 2 : https://github.com/tigrish/devise-i18n/blob/master/rails/locales/el.yml l30 3 : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47870465/rails-5-1-i18n-changes-from-4-2
