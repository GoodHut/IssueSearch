 URL : "https://github.com/XceedBoucherS/TestImport4/issues/22" TITLE : child window crashes xbap BODY : <b>brianlagunas codeplex </b> <br />@deepakmehta the program crashes on startup stack overflow . nbsp @brianlagunas quotso i have looked into it and have found some interesting behavior when dealing with an xbap. i can probably say that you have specifically set the width or height on the childwindow, something like width=quot250quot. take that width off and it will work. but then another issue occurs. the window will not center. this is because for some reason inside an xbap the parent container has no height or width initially. if you hit refresh on your browser then the childwindow will re-center. all these problems are due to the fact that for some reason the parent has a height and width of 0, which means that the childwindow cannot poisiton itself, and which also cause your stack overflow exception you saw when setting the width and/or height. honestly i don't know if this can be fixed, but i will definitely see what i can come up with.quot
