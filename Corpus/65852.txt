 URL : "https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/3684" TITLE : linux bootstrap failing BODY : using https://github.com/rclark/linux to create a docker instance and following commands run. apt-get install clang git clone https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik.git cd mapnik git submodule update --init source bootstrap.sh ./configure make this results in a failure due to the include flags for some libraries not being properly included: -imason_packages/.link/include/cairo -imason_packages/.link/include/freetype2 -imason_packages/.link/include/libpng16 -imason_packages/osx-x86_64/libgdal/2.1.3/include work around was to add these to custom_cxxflags in config.py .
