 URL : "https://github.com/bbhakhrani/HadithNarrators/issues/1" TITLE : nice project! suggestions BODY : assalamu aleykoum. nice project. hope you will continue working on this. may i suggest that the narrators are better indexed in a db with a unique id. this way there are multiple uses for this and it will still be easy and quick to load the graph with the data :- i think if you teamup with sunnah.com they are on github and develop a new indexing for narrators, would be a great addition.
