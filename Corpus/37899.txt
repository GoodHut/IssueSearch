 URL : "https://github.com/Pyomo/pyomo/issues/125" TITLE : neos gateway timeout BODY : i have been getting the following exception running jobs on neos in pyomo 5.1.1 in both ubuntu and windows: <protocolerror for www.neos-server.org:3333/rpc2: 504 gateway time-out> i believe this is due a time-out in the call to self.kestrel.neos.getintermediateresults here: https://github.com/pyomo/pyomo/blob/79404732c451ec9f143dbdd47d2e372ac1695d8d/pyomo/neos/plugins/kestrel_plugin.py l205-l215 my fix to this problem has been to check self.kestrel.neos.getjobstatus until the job is no longer in 'waiting' status and then proceed with the call to self.kestrel.neos.getintermediateresults . this seems to fix the problem for me, but it relies on checking at a regular time interval and repeated queries to neos. i don't believe this is the best solution. any suggestions?
