 URL : "https://github.com/nortikin/sverchok/issues/1716" TITLE : gist search / metadata BODY : gists have a description field, currently i set that to a default to do later? , but we could have something more useful, and be able to search anonymous gists. sverchok issues can be searched too, and that's where many scriptnode scripts are placed. i think it might be handy to be able to trigger a github-gist search and issue-search directly from the sv io side panel. no eta on this but it might happen this weekend.
