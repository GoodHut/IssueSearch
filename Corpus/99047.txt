 URL : "https://github.com/roblanf/somatic-variation/issues/2" TITLE : make a filtering.sh script BODY : first idea is something like: 1. run picard tools on the vcf and save the summary of the un-filtered calls, as well as getting concordance of variants between replicates 2. do a bunch of filtering with bcftools filter 3. summarise again with picard tools and bcftools filter input options should be to do with which filters to use etc. output should be some summary files, and a filtered or flagged vcf file.
