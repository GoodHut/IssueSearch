 URL : "https://github.com/dropbox/dbxcli/issues/66" TITLE : rename a file? BODY : am i doing something wrong? there doesn't seem to be a way to rename or copy a file to a new name. i've tried the following: dbxcli cp x.txt test/y.txt dbxcli mv x.txt y.txt both end up with a folder /test/y.txt or /y.txt respectively with x.txt inside it. i'd settle for a 'ren' command, but i'd like to see support with cp and mv commands.
