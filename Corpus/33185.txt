 URL : "https://github.com/alperakcan/fuse-ext2/issues/69" TITLE : add an offset option BODY : it would be nice to have an offset option, similar to mount . the solution in 64 is a good workaround for now, but i think it would be nicer and quicker if using a large file to do something like $ sudo ./fuse-ext2/fuse-ext2 disk2.raw tmp -o offset=$ 2048 512 than $ dd if=disk2.raw of=disk2.raw1 bs=512 skip=2048 count=202752 $ sudo ./fuse-ext2/fuse-ext2 disk2.raw1 tmp
