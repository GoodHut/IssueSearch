 URL : "https://github.com/AlmuraDev/Almura/issues/359" TITLE : suggestion: mods to add BODY : i have two mods for you guys that i think would be nice to see on almura 3.0. fairy lights: http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/2488166-fairy-lights-decorate-your-world-with-hanging and storage drawers: http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/2198533-storage-drawers-1-7-10-1-12 both fairly simple really but they are nice. they complement existing mods and add new interesting things of their own. i know you are both busy and waiting on other things but maybe take a look if you have a moment. thanks.
