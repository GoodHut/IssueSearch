 URL : "https://github.com/FXServer-ESX/fxserver-esx_atm/issues/12" TITLE : too many blips BODY : by it's own or with several resources it works fine. but there is a threshold for blips. with addition of new atm locations map blips are buggy: some of them have no text, some doesn't appear, sometimes blips list disappear at all. new system of locating atms is needed, for eample, making a waypoint to nearest atm through phone.
