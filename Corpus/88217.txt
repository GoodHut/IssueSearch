 URL : "https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1721" TITLE : multi-lingual tei and xml BODY : follow up on 1707. the xml specs https://www.w3.org/tr/xml/ sec-lang-tag define the scope of @xml:lang to include attribute values. the p5 guidelines http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-att.global.html however ignore this and only cover the element's content : language indicates the language of the element content using a ‘tag’ generated according to bcp 47. this creates further problems for multi-lingual documents, and for the recommendations concerning odd customisation. since all default attribute values are 'en' it is possible for users to create valid tei documents like this: xml ... <body xml:lang= en > <div type= 節版 >my awesome div</div> </body> i would argue that a the guidelines should reflect the xml specs. and b the guidelines should be updated regarding i18n and l10n strategies to make users aware that by defining @xml:lang on any element, it's attribute values default, suggested, or otherwise mandated need to be adopted accordingly.
