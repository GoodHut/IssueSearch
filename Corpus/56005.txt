 URL : "https://github.com/owncloud/QA/issues/499" TITLE : make ui tests portable BODY : our current implementation is too connected to sauce labs and it requires to set up the whole environment locally to run setting up environment: https://github.com/owncloud/core/wiki/running-ui-tests-using-selenium i'd like to have a way to run these tests locally using docker containers. this image can be used as chrome+selenium https://hub.docker.com/r/selenium/standalone-chrome-debug/ it can be accessed using vnc client. password 'secret' . for doing this the script will need to be improved to allow this kind of local running. @individual-it also running ui tests on apps requires the same to run locally: https://github.com/owncloud/files_texteditor/blob/master/tests/travis/start_ui_tests.sh they depend strongly to the core's run script and the paths are different. apps in the docker images are located in $oc_path/custom/ cc @phil-davis coming from https://github.com/owncloud-docker/testing/issues/3
