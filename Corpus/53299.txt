 URL : "https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/Caliburn.Micro/issues/493" TITLE : display error messages BODY : hi, so, i have implemented inotifydataerrorinfo and it works fine. now, i want to have a nice error massage display. a nice way is to use a template and adorner, but ... where should i place this? i tried in the resourcedirectory of the application.xaml, but only get error messages. here one sample: <controltemplate x:key=”validationtemplate”> <dockpanel> <textblock fontsize=”15″ fontweight=”bold” foreground=”red” padding=”1″ text=”” /> <adornedelementplaceholder /> </dockpanel> </controltemplate> is there any chance to have such an template for the whole app? my app navigates throgh a lot of views and i want to use the same error viewing style along all this views. thanks for helping. with best regards gerhard
