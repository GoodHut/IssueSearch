 URL : "https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-rb.org/issues/134" TITLE : better gems page BODY : the gems page http://dry-rb.org/gems/ is pretty barebones right now. if we pull the highlighted gems off the home page in 133, we'll need a better place to showcase them. i'm thinking we could do the following to improve the gems page: - add a featured gems area for the popular/important ones - do something to make the full listing look a bit nicer. fatten things up, offer links to both docs and source code, maybe even relevant guides with dry-rb.org once we add them .
