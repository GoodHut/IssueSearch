 URL : "https://github.com/roelmann/moodle-theme_handlebar/issues/6" TITLE : processing of strings BODY : hi, i've allready created an issue regarding dynamic links . i now open a new one because i have a propossal. i've tested the plugin https://moodle.org/plugins/filter_filtercodes - that enables users to enter codes courseid, userid ... that transforms into real data when viewed from students - with your theme. i found out that it does not work. i've created an issue on https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-filter_filtercodes/issues/7 and got an response, that the theme probably doesn't use format_string or format_text functions as you can read on a link above. can you look at this issue and do anything about it? i realy miss some links in your theme that are essential for our work and would like to add them. thanks and bye janko
