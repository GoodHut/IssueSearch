 URL : "https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/issues/4568" TITLE : typeerrors aren't caught BODY : platform: ios tns: 3.1.0 it's been like this since 2.5 or maybe even earlier for me. my {n} application s does not catch any typeerror. say i make this error: js function test { this.options = { foo: false }; this.optoins.foo = true; } in the function i mistype this.options as this.optoins . but the terminal doesn't log the error unless i wrap the code in a try/catch. developing an application without typeerror logging by default slows down the development process a lot. how can i fix this? i know there is an event inside the application module called uncaughterrorevent , but this is about a typeerrorevent, which doesn't seem to exist. thanks in advance!
