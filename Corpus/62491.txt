 URL : "https://github.com/ben01189998819991197253/contrail/issues/5" TITLE : compatibility with fish BODY : as we're using the crate ansi_term to display colored/styled text, our current approach should work for all terminal emulators. however, we just assume that the user is using bash, and the two shells have different ways of outputting formatted text. things that need to happen: - either auto-detect the user's shell or preferably make the shell-type a command-line argument - refactor the module-formatting code to allow for either bash or fish color escape sequences - update readme.md to include instructions for ~/.config/fish/config.fish and mention compatibility
