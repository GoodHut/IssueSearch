 URL : "https://github.com/sindresorhus/ama/issues/503" TITLE : do you use skeleton repos? BODY : one of the ways i've been able to crank out quite a few repos of my own though mainly for company purposes is having skeletons for es2015, react, etc. packages that have all of the dependencies, npm scripts, and semantic-release configuration i need already set up. but i can't tell if you're doing anything similar for your packages...do you?
