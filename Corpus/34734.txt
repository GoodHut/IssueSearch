 URL : "https://github.com/torkel104/libstrangle/issues/16" TITLE : control fps runtime? BODY : hi, i don't really use libstrangle, but i think it would be useful if the library may watch i may think at inotify or via a resonably high poll rate a global setting and limit the fps accordingly. it would come handy to set a system-wide fps limiter when say a laptop is plugged or not, for power saving purposes.
