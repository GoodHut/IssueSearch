 URL : "https://github.com/konteck/express-sessions/issues/8" TITLE : destroy session event BODY : hello and thanks for your wonderful package that make life a bit easier! my request is to implement an event handler when you want to delete the session before deleting . i understand that apparently destroy session fires based on maxage but it is not always the case. for example if user delete the sid id in his browser , then a new session key will be created and the previous session will be destroyed without any notification. thanks
