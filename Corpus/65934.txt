 URL : "https://github.com/baianat/vee-validate/issues/982" TITLE : localization hot reload BODY : versions: - vuejs: 2 - vee-validate: 2.0.0-rc.21 - nuxt: 1.0.0-rc9 description: first of all thank you for excellent library. i love to use it. i have integrated it into my nuxt.js project but i want to implement hot-reload of the localisation files. i initialise vee-validate inside plugins directory like this: import vue from 'vue' import veevalidate from 'vee-validate' vue.use veevalidate, { fieldsbagname: 'vfields', inject: true, locale: 'en' } my app has implemented hot reload for changing locale, but i need to integrate this into vee-validate as well. i haven't been successful. i have tried this, but the locale won't change: import veevalidate, { validator } from 'vee-validate' validator.localize 'sl' if i do this import veevalidate, { validator } from 'vee-validate' import sl from 'vee-validate/dist/locale/sl' validator.localize 'sl', sl then it works. do i need to import all my available locales in advance in other to hot reload? i don't want to do that because i would have unused imports until i switch to that locale ... any advice?
