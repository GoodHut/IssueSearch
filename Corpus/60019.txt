 URL : "https://github.com/ethereum/mist/issues/3344" TITLE : wallet wont sync issue BODY : hey guys, im sure you're sick of this question but im really struggling with getting the wallet to sync, ive tried everything from deleting the chain-data and starting geth in --fast --cache=2048 mode but it always struggles to download the last 100 blocks. it starts downloading the chain structure at this point and it never stops it goes well into 7 million blocks with no end in sight. i've even hard reset my computer backing everything up on a separate hard drive of course to see if that would help. cant find a solution that will work on any site. starting to lose the world to live here really want to take part in the inda hash ico but cant get access to my account. is there any way of getting a hold of my ether without the wallet e.g. a browser version? currently in work so couldn't tell you what version im on i know its the latest one anyway. version: 0.0.0 os & version: windows node version: geth 0.0.0 number of blocks synchronized: 4,657,000 <!-- check the already existing issues to keep duplicates at a minimum. you'll find possible solutions for these common issues below on mist wiki: https://github.com/ethereum/mist/wiki. - ether is not shown in the wallet - i send ether to the wallet contract but it doesn't show up - mist is synchronized but is stuck during the last part - your computers time is out of sync! error - unable to find peers - my transaction is not confirmed - account can't be unlocked - unable to import pre-sale wallet - bind address already in use when creating this issue, if possible add the following to your report: - screenshots - check the console, of mist ctrl/cmd + alt + i and take a screenshot - log files - go to menu -> accounts -> backup -> application data - zip and upload node.log and all other node.log.x files -->
