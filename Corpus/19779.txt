 URL : "https://github.com/PAIR-code/deeplearnjs/issues/158" TITLE : add webcl support? BODY : feel free to add a discussion tag to this. i'm willing to put in the work to turn this into an eventual pr, but wanted to run this past the group before doing so. i'm not sure if i'm blindly attempting to put a round peg in a square hole, so hopefully some healthy discussion will help before committing to the time. without further adieu: motivation - webcl should be a little clearer when it comes to distributed math performed on gpu, and hopefully be a quicker too. - deeplearn is actually a pretty cool substitute for anyone who prefers nodejs over python for example: me, in this case , so we might as wel move to an enhanced nodejs version with the benefit of easier implementation whenever webcl is adopted. pros - wide gpu/multi-threaded cpu support - huge performance-boost for nodejs and later on: browsers too, though less since it already leverages webgl - prettier math; since kernels seem to be lower level than shaders. cons - webcl has been in draft status for a while https://www.khronos.org/registry/webcl/specs/1.0.0/ now, and it's hard to say what the roadmap towards adoption is. - maintaining 3 versions of all the math classes; cpu + webgl + webcl instead of -the current- 2. there are already a few decent webcl implementations https://github.com/mikeseven/node-webcl available which could possible serve up necessary bindings for nodejs, and be a drop-in-replacement with webcl once it's available in browsers as well. love to hear your thoughts before diving in
