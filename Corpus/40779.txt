 URL : "https://github.com/casasnovas/afl/issues/2" TITLE : using kernel fuzzing BODY : i've seen your presentation at vault 2016. could you give us some notes on how to run kernel fuzzing on some filesystem? i realize that kernel_fuzzing/perf_event_open/init can be used for creating a sample input image that is to be mutated by afl. i'm not sure about the rest of the files inside kernel_fuzzing/ and the order of their execution.
