 URL : "https://github.com/wix/detox/issues/130" TITLE : test animation progress BODY : thanksâ€‹ again, sorry that i open so many issues lately. i was wondering how i might test animation progress in general. in my case i have an open state which is rendered. as i read through the docs i saw that detox waits for the idle state, e.g. not in the middle of the animation. how can i overcome this feature? i would like to write tests like after 100ms it is about half way through , may i use the expect without an await for that or is it just not possible?
