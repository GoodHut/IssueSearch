 URL : "https://github.com/svg/svgo/issues/802" TITLE : merging duplicate markers BODY : an inkscape document i created used mid-markers on paths. after running svgo i see: xml <defs> <marker id= b orient= auto overflow= visible > <path fill= 727272 fill-rule= evenodd stroke-width= 1pt d= m-2.5-1c0 2.76-2.24 5-5 5s-5-2.24-5-5 2.24-5 5-5 5 2.24 5 5z transform= matrix .2 0 0 .2 1.48 .2 /> </marker> <marker id= b orient= auto overflow= visible > <path fill= 727272 fill-rule= evenodd stroke-width= 1pt d= m-2.5-1c0 2.76-2.24 5-5 5s-5-2.24-5-5 2.24-5 5-5 5 2.24 5 5z transform= matrix .2 0 0 .2 1.48 .2 /> </marker> ... </defs> <path marker-mid= url b ... > ... </path> <path marker-mid= url c ... > ... </path> ... this particular document has 15 duplicate marker definitions. merging them reduces the file size by 30%. would merging these duplicate markers be a safe optimisation for svgo? are there similar examples i can look at to help build a pr? as i said elsewhere, i'm interested in making some contributions to this project. i'd like some feedback on ideas before putting together prs.
