 URL : "https://github.com/GM-Alex/user-access-manager/issues/25" TITLE : array_merge error BODY : hi alex, i just noticed that one page of my website shows this error: “warning: array_merge : argument 1 is not an array in … /wp-content/plugins/user-access-manager/class/useraccessmanager.php on line 1494” i looked at the php-file and found this function: if count $aallexcludedposts > 0 { $owpquery->query_vars ‘post__not_in’ = array_merge _$owpquery->query_vars ‘post__not_in’ ,_ $aallexcludedposts ; line 1494 is highlighted in italic. this error appears only on one page, not on any other of the pages. as uam has no specific function on this page, i cannot see why this error appears there. as soon as i log in, the error is gone, but any visitor will see it. any ideas how to fix this? thanks in advance, schokopress
