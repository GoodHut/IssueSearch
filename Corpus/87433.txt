 URL : "https://github.com/meyerjp3/psychometrics/issues/10" TITLE : license and maven central BODY : is there license for this project? if not, is it ok if i include some code from it in a project i'm working on? i would prefer just to grab it from maven central, but i can't find it there. is there a plan to upload it there so it can be included in projects? my workaround is to import all fo the code into my project, which i can do and properly credit and all, but just using the maven dependency would be the best. unfortunately, i can't figure out a way to just import the jar into my project, not for lack of trying.
