 URL : "https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/issues/2020" TITLE : redesign admin dashboard BODY : dashboard cannot have the same layout as the customer website. customers and administrators have completely different needs. for example a customer will mostly look at products by imagen, but the administrator will probably search by sku, if the ecommerce has many products. in this case a vertical table of products with a sku column will improve considerably the readibility of the sku making easier to search for a product. my suggestion is to have a shopify like dashboard which is considered one of the best on the market in terms of usability.
