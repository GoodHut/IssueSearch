 URL : "https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/4234" TITLE : light weight pants server BODY : in oss pants, $ for i in seq 10 ; do time ./pants goals &> /dev/null; done ranges from 1.2 to 1.5 seconds. in twitter, we consume pants in pex. sample data: $ for i in seq 10 ; do time ./pants goals &> /dev/null; done ranges from 2.3 to 3 seconds. which is way too much for a simple operations like ./options or goals . the overhead not only comes from pants itself, but from unpacking pants from pex as well. hence i am proposing/ going to experiment the idea to spin a lightweight server that listens to incoming commands right before bootstrapping options https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/1f554c8ca1fc56b4830091d7c75aac3056785e9e/src/python/pants/bin/pants_runner.py l49-l49 comments / suggestions welcome!
