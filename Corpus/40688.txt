 URL : "https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-storage-js/issues/12" TITLE : usage in web workers BODY : hey folks ðŸ‘‹ i was wondering if there was a way to use this library or blockstack.js in a web worker. the issue i'm having is that each time i store my application state, the browser hangs because the state is so large and the storing process is executed in the same thread. so i tried to do a blockstack.putfile inside a web worker, but that doesn't work because putfile accesses the localstorage . thoughts?
