 URL : "https://github.com/Xainey/PSTestReport/issues/3" TITLE : publish to gallery BODY : this project is _awesome_. i don't mind doing a git clone to get it, but having it available on the gallery would be phenomenal - i've been using some janky exe to get the reports from my tests. this even looks prettier. i'd be down to help with this!
