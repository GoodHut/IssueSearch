 URL : "https://github.com/ocsigen/lwt/issues/321" TITLE : compilation against 4.05 BODY : lwt_unix doesn't compile against ocaml 4.05 currently in beta . the reason is an additional constructor in unix.open_flag o_keepexec . this brings up quite an ugly situation. the constructor aliases could be removed, but that would break a lot of code. alternatively, some conditional compilation mechanism would need to be used and that's not exactly elegant . and of course some of the current packages in opam would need to be fixed with separate +4.05 versions? .
