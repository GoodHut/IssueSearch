 URL : "https://github.com/CartoDB/cartodb/issues/12236" TITLE : faulty layer counter BODY : @arredond commented on tue may 30 2017 https://github.com/cartodb/support/issues/738 context note: this only happened opening a new map once. haven't been able to reproduce; the counter is working fine in other maps. the recently added layer counter in builder starts on 0, even though there always has to be at least one layer to create a dashboard. that means that, when you reach the limit of 8 layers, the counter is showing one less in most cases, 7/8 . ! layer_count_0 https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19406854/26573412/f737d1a4-451d-11e7-8541-4d134d9d5460.png ! layer_count https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19406854/26573418/f8a310a8-451d-11e7-80f5-92d1528268a2.png
