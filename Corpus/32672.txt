 URL : "https://github.com/lightninglabs/lightning-app/issues/73" TITLE : we don't have tests BODY : description we currently don't have tests for this application. tests provide numerous advantages such as ensuring our code doesn't break and gives developers confidence that our code works. if we all agree that this application needs tests, there are a couple of questions to ask. 1 what libraries/tools do we use for testing? there is jasmine https://jasmine.github.io/ , mocha https://mochajs.org/ , jest https://facebook.github.io/jest/ , etc. 2 if we adopt testing, what is the policy for testing new code going forward? 3 how do we handle old code that has yet been tested? i'm sure there are other questions that need to be answered but that's all i have for now. as a side note, i would love to start writing tests for every lightning package in this application. this way, i can familiarize myself with the codebase. if we can agree that we need tests and state which libraries/tools we should use, and if i have the maintainer's blessing, i'll get to work on writing these tests. steps to reproduce the behavior none. expected behavior we have a full-suite of tests that ensures our code works as intended and provides full code-coverage. actual behavior we have no tests. : screenshot and/or logs if applicable none.
