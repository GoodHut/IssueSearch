 URL : "https://github.com/superRaytin/react-monaco-editor/issues/53" TITLE : editor does not resize BODY : the monaco-editor component does not update to match the dimensions of the container it is within when the container resizes. this only affects when a percentage height or width is supplied. i believe this may be accomplished by calling editor.layout but have not been able to make it work yet.
