 URL : "https://github.com/revelrylabs/revelry_core_node/issues/71" TITLE : roadmap h2 2017 BODY : want to start building our roadmap for the back half of this year, work out what we're doing and not doing. thoughts in no particular order - branding: revelry_core_node is a particularly bad name because it isn't really for node, and it isn't just for revelry. even the package name revelry-components is bad, because you can use this outside of our toolkit. we should name this thing after what it does and why you would use it. - better docs site. right now, the docs site is very bare bones. - need to bring in the next base styles. - needs non-example content. - home page explaining what it is and why you'd use it. - needs a getting started guide / tutorial. - the examples could be better. - need documentation of the props. - integration of more modern tooling - styled component? - sketch integration - react primitives? - can we build a toolkit that 100% works on both react dom and react native? open to any other ideas. let's get it all on the board and decide how and where to start.
