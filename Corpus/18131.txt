 URL : "https://github.com/tangrams/tangram-es/issues/1556" TITLE : smart marker zoom BODY : tangram-es should provide a smart zoom utility given an arbitrary set of markers points, lines, polygons that can compute the optimal map position and zoom level so all markers are visible in the viewport. currently this requires lots of math on behalf of the developer to calculate this using coordinates and screen size. see this example in eraser map in the method mainactivity.zoomtoshowroute ... implemented by @matteblair using an axisalignedboundingbox . https://github.com/mapzen/eraser-map/blob/master/app/src/main/kotlin/com/mapzen/erasermap/controller/mainactivity.kt l801-l854 this is a feature we will want to implement in both android and ios so it may be a good candidate to be written in a way that can be used cross-platform https://github.com/mapzen/android/issues/250 cc/ @msmollin
