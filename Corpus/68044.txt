 URL : "https://github.com/RolifyCommunity/rolify/issues/436" TITLE : refresh the upgrade doc BODY : the upgrade doc https://github.com/rolifycommunity/rolify/blob/master/upgrade.rdoc currently documents how to upgrade from 1.x, 2.x and 3.x. we are about to upgrade rolify from 3.1.0 to 5.1.0 in our product, and i am wondering if someone has had to do something similar and noticed missing info in the doc, and/or if there is a need for a section detailing how to upgrade from 4.x.
