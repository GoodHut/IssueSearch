 URL : "https://github.com/jbasko/configmanager/issues/108" TITLE : rethink public interface BODY : this library has two separate goals actually: 1. provide a clean interface to load and get config values reliably from different sources in the right type with the right fallbacks. 2. make it easy to enrich config items and potentially sections with more attributes maybe section class called config now and item shouldn't be so prominent in the public interface. instead, maybe there is a place for a wrapper around those two called config probably which then does not expose any of the rich underlying functionality. maybe there is a place for two separate concepts: 1. config manager reader, writer, item and section controller 2. config provider better name? whose only task is to return config values
