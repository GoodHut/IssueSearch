 URL : "https://github.com/afollestad/nock-nock/issues/12" TITLE : reduce false positives BODY : i get a lot of warnings that my sites are down, but they are due to connection time-outs or tls handshake errors. i don't use cellular data so i get this when moving out of wi-fi coverage while a check is in progress. i would propose: upon failure, retry immediately; if the internet connection has disappeared in the meantime, don't issue a site is down warning; only when the second attempt fails too, issue a warning.
