 URL : "https://github.com/remiprev/teamocil/issues/120" TITLE : quoting in yaml BODY : quoting in the yaml file is a little tricky. the following does not work: windows: - name: railsprod root: ~ layout: even-vertical panes: - ssh server -t 'cd /var/log/rails; bash --login' - ssh server -t 'cd /var/rails_apps; bash --login' if i double quote the ssh command parameter it does work so i'm good. but for kicks, i ran this yaml through yamllint.com i don't know if this is a good resource or not and got: windows: - name: railsprod root: ~ layout: even-vertical panes: - ssh server -t 'cd /var/log/rails; bash --login' - ssh server -t 'cd /var/rails_apps; bash --login' and teamocil doesn't like that quoting either.
