 URL : "https://github.com/AltSysrq/lmdb-zero/issues/4" TITLE : missing impls for lmdbraw BODY : the docs for lmdbraw state, all integer and floating-point types have this trait . however, this is not true. almost no integer or floating-point types have this trait. this breaks things like access.get::<str, f64> &db, key my supported platforms are all x64, so i have no portability concerns. it would be nice if the lmdb source had: unsafe impl lmdbraw for f64 { } so i don't have to wrap things like this in slices.
