 URL : "https://github.com/peterbourgon/g2s/issues/14" TITLE : send ints as timing BODY : statsd timing can be used for not only measuring time, but also other statistical values where you need automatically calculated count, mean, sum, upper etc. i have added such function in my fork, where you can pass int instead of time.duration and it is not divided from nanoseconds to milliseconds: https://github.com/oskarwojciski/g2s/commit/e0e201f4d23c9d69063f302332bc72baa03b7895 if you think it can be useful for anybody else, then i can update readme.md and do pull request.
