BODY : is it possible to browse the contents of an external sd card? with browse device , i can see and modify the contents of the main sd card, but i can't see the external one. in the kde app, i chose a location on the external sd card for the destination directory in the share and receive settings section and i am able to use the indicator's send file s feature to send files from my laptop to the external sd card. so the app can access the external sd card, but i haven't found a way to browse to it. i know android is weird about what you can and can't do with the external sd card....
