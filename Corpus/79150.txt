BODY : description: changeme: describe the issue here when the player engages a mob equipped with a bow or gun - the mob runs away from the player, allowing it to kite the player. this also happens when spell casters are interrupted. exceedingly game breaking and removes the fun in leveling. current behaviour: when the player engages a mob equipped with a bow or gun - the mob runs away from the player, allowing it to kite the player. this also happens when spell casters are interrupted. if the player runs away - the mob will follow about 10 yards away to keep shooting/spell cast. if the player runs towards the mob - it will run away to keep a max distance to allow the mob to shoot. changeme: explain to us if/how it currently works. mobs equipped with bows or guns or spell casters kite players until they die - especially melee. the mobs probably have a minimum range setting - which is set too high. expected behaviour: changeme: explain to us how the issue is supposed to work. when a player comes up to a mob that shoots/ spell casts, the mob should continue to shoot without putting in a distance or start doing melee damage when the player is too close for the mob to allow it to shoot. steps to reproduce the problem: 1. step 1 change shooting distance to 0-30 yards. 2. step 2 3. step 3 screenshots: url... url... url...
