 URL : "https://github.com/mikaelpatel/Arduino-GPIO/issues/2" TITLE : support for arduino mega BODY : avr atmega2560 based boards are currently not support. access to ports with higher io port address need synchronized access. they do not compile to single instructions and thus not atomic. gpio member function need to be atomic even for these.
