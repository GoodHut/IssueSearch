 URL : "https://github.com/sheredom/utf8.h/issues/40" TITLE : a question on casting BODY : well, this is not an issue, it is an elementary question/request. you have said, ..... having it as a void forces a user to explicitly cast the utf8 string to char such that the onus is on them not to break the code anymore!.... i am not very strong on this. can you please give an example on how to do this casting in the code........or point me to any page where such example code is given. thanks
