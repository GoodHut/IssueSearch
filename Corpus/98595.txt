 URL : "https://github.com/schmittjoh/JMSPaymentCoreBundle/issues/211" TITLE : issues with multiple forms BODY : i have a page with several forms. recently, i updated this bundle and now, it looks like the second form overwrites the options of the transformer of the first one. it could very well be the case, because a change has been introduced in 473c49f1f07215e11c02dc524f571f37e16b70fa to create this transformer, which means if you have two forms, the transformer is the same : payment.form.choose_payment_method_transformer
