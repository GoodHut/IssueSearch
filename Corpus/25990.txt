 URL : "https://github.com/javagl/gltfTestModels/issues/1" TITLE : add more pbr models BODY : the remaining pbr test models from @moneimne at https://github.com/moneimne/webgl-pbr should be added here. preferably, the models should be in a form that is as close as possible to the state that they will eventually have in the official gltf sample models repository. for example, the textures should not require the non-standard flipy property, and there should be combined metallic- and roughness textures. the tool at https://javagl.github.io/metallicroughnesscreator/metallicroughnesscreator.html might be helpful here, although i'm pretty sure that the implementation is horrible .
