 URL : "https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2285" TITLE : review http security BODY : we should make sure we're providing good, thorough security defaults, or at least documentation on the available options. not sure if this fits better as flask config, werkzeug middleware, or a separate flask-http-security extension. overview of http security headers: https://blog.appcanary.com/2017/http-security-headers.html django's security options: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/security/ some things, such as csrf and sql are handled by other libraries, not flask as a first step, good for beginners, it would be nice to get a writeup here of what's already covered and what's not.
