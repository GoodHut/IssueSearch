 URL : "https://github.com/opendns/autotask-php/issues/74" TITLE : query without conditional BODY : would it be possible to do a query without any conditionals? i keep getting returncode 0 if i do this, and will have to pass on like $field->addexpression 'beginswith', '' ; just to list everything in an entity. another default workaround: $field = new atws\autotaskobjects\queryfield 'id' ; $field->addexpression 'notequal', 0 ; $query->addfield $field ;
