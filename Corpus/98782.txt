 URL : "https://github.com/yagajs/leaflet-ng2/issues/251" TITLE : leaflet plugin integration BODY : hi, i was wondering how to integrate any leaflet js plugin into an angular project using yagajs ? most of them usually : - define new items in the existing namespace l - add new option parameters in the constructor of the map - add new set of functions on existing types - ... have you tried adding such plugins into projects using yagajs ? if you succeeded, it could be a good idea to either give an example here, or add a few lines of documentation somewhere in the repository. thank you.
