 URL : "https://github.com/angelleye/paypal-woocommerce/issues/884" TITLE : settings panel cleanup BODY : right now we have our settings panel under settings -> paypal for woocommerce. inside this we have tabs for each of the different gateways, but in each of those tabs it simply links to the settings panel under wc -> settings -> checkout. i'd like to clean this up so we don't have so many tabs. we could just have one tab that says paypal payment gateway products and then list each of the links under that to go to the settings pages instead of separate tabs for all. this will leave us more room for extra tabs we'll be adding from premium extensions.
