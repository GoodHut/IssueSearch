 URL : "https://github.com/toggl/mobileapp/issues/438" TITLE : persist data after fetch BODY : we want to persist workspaces, tags, clients, projects, tasks and time entries in order while passing on the parallel api request observables. the order is important because later entries might depend on earlier ones to be stored correctly except that tags can happen anytime between workspaces and time entries . for now, we will not bother ourselves with dealing with the user being removed from workspaces. we will also not worry about tags and tasks just yet. that leaves workspaces, clients, projects and time entries. only the latter can be changed within our app, so that is the only one we have to run conflict resolution for. hence, let's split this into two parts: - persist workspaces, clients, projects: 435 - persist time entries: 437
