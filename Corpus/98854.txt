 URL : "https://github.com/statgen/pheweb/issues/28" TITLE : link from gene names to lz BODY : at the page <http://pheweb.sph.umich.edu/top_hits>, gene names should link to lz. there are two options for how to do that: - i make urls like /region/<phenocode>/gene/<genename> and the server does the work. - when serving top_hits.json i add in regions for each gene either alongside of in a mapping and the rendering code injects the links. later, should i build /gene/<genename> , where, again, the server does the work? then the schema will be: /random /top_hits /variant/1:3432423-a-g /pheno/bmi /region/irf4/1:34234-34323 /region/irf4/gene/irf4 /gene/irf4
