 URL : "https://github.com/cbg-ethz/shorah/issues/26" TITLE : modernising c/c++ code BODY : the current code base emits warnings such as: ../../src/shorah/dpm_sampler.cpp:2070:11: warning: taking the absolute value of unsigned type 'unsigned int' has no effect -wabsolute-value if 1.0 fabs running_sum - n history / n history > 0.001 { ^ ../../src/shorah/dpm_sampler.cpp:2070:11: note: remove the call to 'fabs' since unsigned values cannot be negative if 1.0 fabs running_sum - n history / n history > 0.001 { ^~~~ ../../src/shorah/contain.cpp:76:14: warning: comparison of unsigned expression < 0 is always false -wtautological-compare if r.pos < 0 { ~~~~~ ^ ~ ../../src/shorah/freqest.cpp:91:14: warning: comparison of unsigned expression < 0 is always false -wtautological-compare if r.pos < 0 { i think we should fix these for the next release. 1. the first two are likely due to the c minefield of converting integers of the same rank to an unsigned type, which can likely be resolved by adding a bunch of static_cast<int> 's. 2. the second bunch of errors could be deeper, and will likely require converting genomic offsets to signed integers which is imo better anyways .
