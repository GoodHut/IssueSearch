 URL : "https://github.com/Thomas101/wmail/issues/485" TITLE : package wmail as an rpm BODY : pretty much the title. i think wmail would benefit from this as a lot of people are put off when installing non packaged files. it would also make it easier to install on rpm distros. i am relatively rusty with packaging but i am willing to take on the task. i found it relatively trivial to install via source, but a package would make it a lot easier.
