 URL : "https://github.com/lexi-lambda/rascal/issues/13" TITLE : make parantheses optional. BODY : i have not much experience with lispy languages, but there was always something that bugged me about its syntax: why do i need to write parentheses when they can be inferred? example with syntax i made up : lisp def foo a b dosomething a b the indentation makes it obvious that dosomething a b is member of def foo ... . lets take a look how what happens when we hide that can be inferred at compile time. lisp def foo a b dosomething a b in other words, why not make the syntax indentation sensitive? can it be done in racket? there is an interesting project oczor https://github.com/ptol/oczor that does exactly that. except it uses records instead of lists by default.
