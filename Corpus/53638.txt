 URL : "https://github.com/slothbear/clesti/issues/3" TITLE : enhance error handling BODY : there are many things that could go wrong, especially with the parsing of the pasted html. the current error handlind displays the first two lines of the stack trace. at least: reformat the stack trace to make it easier to find the error message. more: do a doctor-style run or pre-chew the html or something – to validate the html before parsing then getting a generic error . the parsing and processing rely on very specific structures in the html. look for them some other non-parsing way before really parsing. some unvalidated ideas: 1. one <table>/<tbody> 1. more than zero <tr> lines with specific attributes? 1. specific header text make sure it is really a role report and not some random html 1. structure of per-member report. blank <tr> before each new member: <tr><td colspan=6><hr></td></tr>
