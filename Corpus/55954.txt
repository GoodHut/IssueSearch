 URL : "https://github.com/vcflib/vcflib/issues/185" TITLE : make a release please? BODY : hi there, i'm doing a bit of ansible deployment to few servers and vcflib compilation always fails on one or two random servers. this is perhaps because i'm always pulling from master branch and thus might get one or two beta commits. would you be able to make new release that i can use as a set version in my ansible, that would really help. p.s i can ssh directory to a machine and fix it there, but i'd rather that happened through ansible. also this isn't dep issues because sometimes compilation fails on the machine it was previously compiled. but i can't really say why this happens. either new release would help. thanks heaps, kirill
