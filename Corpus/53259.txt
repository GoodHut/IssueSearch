 URL : "https://github.com/chaorace/cqui/issues/214" TITLE : diplomacy screen delay BODY : can you please add a feature that decreases or fully removes the delay before showing the controls on the diplomacy screen? for example when you meet a new civ, you need to wait for the leader to finish their intros unless you hit escape, and even if you do, there is a delay screen fades before showing the choices to say. it would be much more convenient if the controls appeared immediately and by making the choice the leader would stop saying the current sentence and skip to the next thing. i hope i was clear! thanks a lot! if you think it's easy and can give me a place to start i could try to do a pull request
