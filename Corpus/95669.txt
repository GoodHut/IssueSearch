 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/issues/2468" TITLE : detecting operating system BODY : there is a property that i'd like to give an initial value based on the operating system i'm currently running on: windows, osx, linux, etc ... what i'd essentially like to write is the following: xml <roslynruntimeidentifier condition= '$ roslynruntimeidentifier ' == '' and '$ os ' == 'windows_nt' >win7-x64</roslynruntimeidentifier> <roslynruntimeidentifier condition= '$ roslynruntimeidentifier ' == '' and '$ os ' == 'osx' > osx.10.12-x64</roslynruntimeidentifier> <roslynruntimeidentifier condition= '$ roslynruntimeidentifier ' == ''>linux-rid</roslynruntimeidentifier> the $ os flag works for windows by producing windows_nt . i can't find any documentation for this property though and hence can't determine what the values would be for other operating systems. is this property the write way to approach this and if so what are the values for other operating systems.
