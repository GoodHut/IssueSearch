 URL : "https://github.com/nodejs/CTC/issues/156" TITLE : call with v8 team, 3 BODY : we had two https://github.com/nodejs/ctc/issues/62 previous https://github.com/nodejs/ctc/issues/76 meetings, both well received from what i can tell. there were some opportunities to talk to each other at jsconf.eu, and i assume that we will have some more in october at node interactive and the following collaborator summit. until then, i think it makes sense to set up a meeting to sync up before node interactive. some topics that i have in mind: - progress of es6 modules. - custom startup snapshot. @bmeck seems to have explored this a bit. does it make sense to invest time in this, on both ends? - let's recap the hash flooding issue to make sure we can make the process of handling security issues smoother. - is v8 6.1 on the table for node 8? - performance discussions. the previous two meetings were at 10am pst and 9pm pst respectively, both on wednesdays. is there any preference for a different choice of time? @bmeurer @psmarshall @fhinkel @ajklein
