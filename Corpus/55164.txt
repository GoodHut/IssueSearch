 URL : "https://github.com/jcoreio/redux-utils-immutable/issues/4" TITLE : improve dev experience BODY : debugging issues with combinereducers etc. can be tricky because it's not immediately obvious where the problematic reducer was created. i need to figure out the best way to ease debugging in this case. one idea is to store a stack trace when combinereducers etc. is called as long as process.env.node_env !== 'production' , and if applying the reducer throws an error, include the creation stack trace in that error somehow.
