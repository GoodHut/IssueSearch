 URL : "https://github.com/concrete5/concrete5/issues/5852" TITLE : imagine bytes exhausted BODY : i have seen a problem where people upload a gigantic image to their website and the imagine library chokes and takes down the site, sometimes a white screen of death, sometimes an error message. /public_html/concrete/vendor/imagine/imagine/lib/imagine/gd/image.php on line 602 i realize this is really a php config issue and people should not be uploading gigantic images to their websites, but they do upload and often have limited access to php configurations. i think it would be better if imagine could fail more gracefully than taking sites down. thanks
