 URL : "https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/1093" TITLE : expo snack bug BODY : i couldnt find the right place to post bugs on expo snack. hence posting it here. in the expo snack after you generate the embed view. clicking on open to expo the square with arrow icon button from the embeded view, doesnt open the right snack. the issue is that if the snack id is @master-atul/snack_5_0_intro_example the open button omits @master-atul/ resulting in the url being https://snack.expo.io/snack_5_1_folders?session_id=snack-session-hyxfxmdtbf instead of https://snack.expo.io/@master-atul/snack_5_1_folders?session_id=snack-session-hyxfxmdtbf this breaks the app if it has more files.
