 URL : "https://github.com/lavary/crunz-ui/issues/2" TITLE : development being done? BODY : i love this and we would love to implement this for scheduling tasks. already using crunz to declare tasks in code - but a gui would be great especially for running one-time tasks other departments than the developers could run tasks themselves if they need to . however the task form does not seem to display the correct data when editing a task. the command filed always displays the example command. also we would like it if we could specify a function or method to call, rather than having to run a command. in other words if we could specify array 'someclass, 'somemethod' instead of php -r 'call_user_func_array ... '; . since we run crunz in our own project and have the full app auto loaded. please let us know if development is still being done. otherwise we could simply fork the repo and continue the work ourselves. thanks!
