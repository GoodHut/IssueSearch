 URL : "https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/issues/31" TITLE : company specific settings BODY : not meant to be included, but worth to mention which are and why and maybe for to be added to knowledge base. i am using the following: network.automatic-ntlm-auth.allow-non-fqdn boolean: set to true to enable sso auth when using non-fqdn url. network.automatic-ntlm-auth.trusted-uris string: enter domain name where sso is desired, multiple domain are comma separated security.enterprise_roots.enabled boolean: when true, the computer certificate store is used plugins.load_appdir_plugins boolean: i dont know yet the security implications, but when using skype for business s4b and when you click a meeting url in for example email, the s4b meeting client is invoked over a browser and fails to open s4b meeting client... setting this one to true resolves this problem it doesn't work for me personally, since i am browsing with sandboxed ff.... obviously. ;
