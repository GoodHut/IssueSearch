 URL : "https://github.com/sjacobs7/ISQA3420/issues/10" TITLE : dfd comments feb 15 BODY : hey, here are a few comments: 1 scan results and vulnerability results should go back to the developer 2 data request and data response are pretty vague names. it would be better to be more precise in your naming of these 3 the developer should also be able to do the data request and data response that you have from the manager renamed too 4 the crud process is ok. it is not terribly detailed and if you have time, i'd recommend that you make it a bit more granular. mg
