 URL : "https://github.com/datamountaineer/stream-reactor/issues/213" TITLE : elasticsearch 5 - use http BODY : with elasticsearch 5 it is the advised way it to connect via http, not the internal transport protocol. the new elastic 5 connector uses the internal transport protocol protocol. can it be adjusted to http protocol? it is supported by the used client. this way future elastic protocol changes do not need a new connector and one connector can be used for es 2 and 5. our elasticsearch setup only accepts clients via http and we like kcql so this poses a problem
