 URL : "https://github.com/DrSleep/tensorflow-deeplab-resnet/issues/36" TITLE : about the evaluate.py BODY : after i train my model, and get the snapshots, i want to evaluate the final model. however, it doesn't work. i met this issue: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41048819/how-to-restore-a-model-by-filename-in-tensorflow-r12 and i fix it by using the answer: import tensorflow as tf from tensorflow.core.protobuf import saver_pb2 ... saver = tf.train.saver write_version = saver_pb2.saverdef.v1 saver.save sess, './model.ckpt', global_step = step it perhaps the evaluate.py doesn't fit the new saver. could you fix it? thanks
