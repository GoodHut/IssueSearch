 URL : "https://github.com/yunjey/StarGAN/issues/16" TITLE : issues about code BODY : hello, i saw your code of papar stargan . i have some issues. 1 in data_loder.py line 43 random.shuffle lines , each time you get_loader, the lines will be newly shuffled, so these train and test samples may be duplicate ? 2 in paper, equation 6 , i saw the first item of loss g is l_{adv}, but in the code, i only saw loss of d g x,c . i have understood that the first item of the equation 6 has no need to put into the loss function, but how about the last item. thank you.
