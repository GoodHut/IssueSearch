 URL : "https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/239" TITLE : static file serving BODY : first off: let me just say that rocket is very nice and has been a pleasure to use, kudos! i looked around the docs and couldn't find any support for serving a set of static files from a directory. this is something that i've seen supported in every web framework i've ever used. as an arbitrary example, here's how it works in flask http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/quickstart/ static-files . this is a pretty common pattern to serve things like css files and js scripts, so i think it would be useful to have. obviously one can serve individual files by just having a handler that returns a file , but this seems like generally useful functionality. ideally one would simply be able to do something like rocket::ignite .mount /static , staticfiles some_path .
