 URL : "https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/3877" TITLE : colors do not work BODY : colors: true doesn't work when provided in jest.config.js . i use git bash on windows. jest doesn't color output in my terminal. i use colors: true in jest.config.js . and it doesn't work. colors only works when provided as a command line option $ npm test -- --colors why is it so? i don't want to type anything more than necessary. i want to type npm test and it should work. how to enable this behavior? btw, colors: true in package.json doesn't work either. > unknown option debug with value true was found. this is probably a typing mistake. fixing it will remove this message. why so many configs? you have at least three now that work not coordinated. how can i use just one simple config file where i can set up everything needed? all configuration in jest.config.js . no command line options, no package.json options. all in jest.config.js . how?
