 URL : "https://github.com/UCL/LatBo.jl/issues/16" TITLE : test fail on julia-0.5 BODY : hi, i was trying out your module and found that there are several errors while running pkg.test latbo : > error: loaderror: loaderror: undefvarerror: floatingpoint not defined > while loading .\latbo\src\latbo.jl, in expression starting on line 8 floatingpoint is no longer supported https://github.com/julialang/julia/issues/8142 . changing to abstractfloat yields the next error: > error: loaderror: loaderror: loaderror: syntax: < is not a unary operator > while loading .\latbo\src\indices/indices.jl, in expression starting on line 17 which is solved by changing from =< to <= . the next error has me stumped: > error: loaderror: loaderror: loaderror: methoderror: no method matching start ::type{integer} > closest candidates are: > start ::simplevector at essentials.jl:170 > start ::base.methodlist at reflection.jl:258 > start ::intset at intset.jl:184 > while loading c:\users iels\.julia\v0.5\latbo\src\indices/indices.jl, in expression starting on line 21 i don't have enough experience with julia to fix this error. can you update this for julia-0.5, please?
