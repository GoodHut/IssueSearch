 URL : "https://github.com/jdelauney/SIMD-VectorMath-UnitTest/issues/2" TITLE : win32 v unix32 BODY : after many routines which are now tested and working it seems there is no difference between the two, fpc uses a consistent calling convention for 32 bit intel/amd platfroms. should we find any future differences, which i suspect would be very rare, they could be cover with ifdef windows/ ifdef unix. if you agree jerome just assign this to me and i will make it happen.
