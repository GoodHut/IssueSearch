 URL : "https://github.com/xbehave/xbehave.net/issues/409" TITLE : the background feature BODY : there are few minor issues with it. 1. the example https://github.com/xbehave/xbehave.net/wiki/backgrounds doesn't indicate that you can have a different method name other than background . 2. the test runnner display the background test as inconclusive, i don't think it should really display it or is it a limitation? if so maybe it should be documented too. 3. the name of the steps shouldn't start with background but maybe end with it, e.g., currently it looks like this 01 background given a scanner whereas i think it should read like this 01 given a scanner background so maybe it would be a good idea to add an option for it or just change it?
