 URL : "https://github.com/tomcx/tame4/issues/7" TITLE : http access control BODY : hi, i'm testing tame4 on different hardware/possibilities. connecting remotely to cx5130 / cx9020 connecting tame4 to ads on cx9020 i run into the http access control and pre-flight errors. on a cx5130 with windows embedded standard 7 you can add the needed headers into iis and everything is running fine. the cx9020 running windows embedded compact i see no possibility to add the needed headers somewhere. as i am not a javascript expert i had no luck trying xdomain or any proxy possibility to bypass this issue. do you see any resolution to this? great work! bryan
