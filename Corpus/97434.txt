 URL : "https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/issues/440" TITLE : gpio 0 relay does not work BODY : really strange, but i also tested the sonoff.ino.bin you attached to 5.0.6. as long as i bind a relay to gpio 1+ it is working. only the gpio0 does not work. because this is on the wemos the quite common pin d3 i was wondering why on hell my relay did not work again. maybe you can have a look and comment on it. thx.
