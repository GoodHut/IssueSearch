 URL : "https://github.com/aspnet/IISIntegration/issues/315" TITLE : iis application route 404 BODY : i am publishing my first asp.net core app to iis 8.5. i have followed the directions on https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/publishing/iis install .net core windows server hosting bundle https://aka.ms/dotnetcore_windowshosting_1_1_0 stop and start www publishing service net stop was /y net start w3svc run dotnet publish -c production on core app to create publish folder you can rename the publish folder and put this folder on the server. create a no managed code app pool. create an application over the copied publish folder. run https://github.com/aspnet/dataprotection/blob/dev/provision-autogenkeys.ps1 for app pool. these are the instructions i followed. i have the basic default web site pointed at c:\inetpub\wwwroot serving static files. inside of wwwroot i added a folder called project and beneath that i have created an application called api . i can navigate to mywebsite.com/daq/api/home and i am served the home view. i also have a search controller with httpget attribute routing. this route https://github.com/agrc/daq-web-framework/blob/master/api/controllers/searchcontroller.cs l19 fails with a 404 when accessed through iis. if i run dotnet myapp.dll and browse to localhost:5000 and use the url that 404'd through iis, the request succeeds. if i create a new website and point it at the api folder and bind it to port 8080 and navigate to localhost:8080 and the same url, the request succeeds. i would like to have the asp.net core app under the default web site so it will have the same domain name. what is iis doing to cause this 404 or what am i doing to cause this 404?
