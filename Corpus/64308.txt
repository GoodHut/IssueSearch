 URL : "https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack/issues/652" TITLE : freetrack vs opentrack? BODY : hello everyone! first of all, thanks a lot for supporting this project, head tracking is awesome! secondly, i'm a old user of free-track.net, it works nice, but the latest release was in 2008. i'm a bit lost about opentrack, can you please explain what are the main differences between opentrack and freetrack, just so i can catch up? i'm sure some free-track users might have the same question, and since free-track is also an open project and has no profit in mind, i'll post this question on free-track forum just so everybody can keep informed about the latest open source projects in head tracking, still in development.
