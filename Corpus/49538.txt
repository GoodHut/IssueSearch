 URL : "https://github.com/dotsam/homebridge-milight/issues/33" TITLE : turn on to night mode BODY : i was hoping to use night mode along with some sensors and the new automation setting in ios11 to bring the lights on to night mode when motion is detected during the night for example to light the way to the bathroom but setting a milight button to <5 doesn't initiate night mode rather that last setting that the light was on. am i not doing something right?
