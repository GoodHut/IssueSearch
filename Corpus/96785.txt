 URL : "https://github.com/networknt/microservices-framework-benchmark/issues/6" TITLE : fine tuning of jee servers BODY : hi, i would like to point out, that some parts of the benchmark are not really accurate, since they use default app server configs. so wildfly & payara are using by default only 5 threads to serve any servlet in the example jax-rs . increasing the thread number & ejb pool may greatly increase these app server's throughput. i think the same would apply to spring boot benchmarks . conclusion: please make a benchmark with fine tuned app servers to show the real capabilities of the given tech stack. also: in the light-java to my understanding, it is using servlet technology as-is, while jax-rs adds a much heavier layer on the servlets like parsing the incoming requests to dtos and vice-versa or handling http requests based on the headers . conclusion: it would be good to see a simple code on top of a jee or servlet container, that only uses core jee servlets to be measurable. thanks
