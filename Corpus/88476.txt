 URL : "https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/issues/21896" TITLE : no recipe for sheet metal BODY : game version: 0.c-23932-g9ab5c97 tiles operating system: windows 7 professional x64 sp1 tiles or curses: tiles mods active: type : mod_info , ident : user:default , dependencies : dda , experimental-z-level , medieval_stuff , more_survival_tools , no_fungi , statsthroughskills , blazemod , tanks , boats , deoxymod , filthy_morale , makeshift , more_classes_scenarios , more_locations , national_guard_camp , no_npc_food , no_rivtech_guns , novitamins , realguns afaik the only way to get sheet metal is by disassembling/uninstalling items. i would like to see a recipe made for it, unless there's a very good reason why it's been omitted gameplay/balance? . currently i'm playing a wilderness start and although i probably still wouldn't be able to craft sheet metal if a recipe existed for it can't make a clay crucible , i literally have to rely on rng spawning sheet metal at a metal wreckage site to find any haven't found any yet . the sheet of glass recipe would be a good template to start with. tools required: electric or charcoal forge, crucible/clay_crucible, clay mold doesn't exist, but i guess just water and clay would be enough for the recipe. re-usable tool . materials: 2 scrap metals a 2l metal tank requires either a sheet metal or 2 scrap metals to make. i hope 20420 is still being worked on.
