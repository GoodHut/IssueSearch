 URL : "https://github.com/LMMS/lmms/issues/4059" TITLE : midi import malfunctions BODY : when doing midi imports of more than 8 tracks, it only shows the first 8 tracks in the midi, plus the percussion track. when there are changes in volume, it shows all of the automations as if all midi tracks are present . an even stranger part to this bug is that the midi tracks after the 8th midi track have their patches placed on the first midi tracks. i found this out as an lmms bug because i tried it out on a different type of software such as musescore as a composition software or fl and they were imported normally.
