 URL : "https://github.com/RetroShare/RetroShare/issues/867" TITLE : gxs contact link too long BODY : gxs contact link contains much more data then needed probably because avatar is embedded too , this causes it being broken in more messages if sent via other apps like telegram, thus making life harder for mobile users that want just to sent their contact to someone. embedding all the data in the link is not necessary to just exchange contacts and just putting the contact name, the gxs id and the pubkey should suffice, i have been looking at the code but i got lost in gxs internals, probably @csoler could fix it fast and more important before next release.
