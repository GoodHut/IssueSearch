 URL : "https://github.com/covenantkodi/script.module.covenant/issues/1" TITLE : too much eval BODY : just a quick search of the code, i see lots of use of eval function. while i do not know all the ins and outs of this module, it seems like very unsafe code. i would ask if there is a good reason why, but in my experience there is never a good reason. this should be addressed asap.
