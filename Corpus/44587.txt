 URL : "https://github.com/lmenezes/cerebro/issues/140" TITLE : feature: jump to page BODY : as i have 2k shards, i have about 2k pages in the overview, making impossible to navigate using just the arrow for next/previous page. luckily the search is very useful in this setup... yet sometimes i need to search something that still returns lots of pages and navigating one by one is a pain. so please add a box so we can write the custom page number to jump to, or arrows to jump 10, 100, 1000 pages, so if needed, we can jump further in to the index list thanks for kopf and cerebro!
