 URL : "https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin/issues/731" TITLE : linux installation fails BODY : trying to install libbitcoin on a fresh virtualbox ubuntu 14.04 server vm running on os x , following the instructions for version3 https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin/tree/version3 . everything works as expected, until install.sh fails, unable to find boostlib: checking for boostlib >= 1.57.0... configure: we could not detect the boost libraries version 1.57 or higher . if you have a staged boost library still not installed please specify $boost_root in your environment and do not give a path to --with-boost option. if you are sure you have boost installed, then check your version number looking in <boost/version.hpp>. see http://randspringer.de/boost for more documentation. configure: error: boost 1.57.0 or later is required but was not found. full gist of install.sh output is here https://gist.github.com/wlbentley/f1e4e58ae76d5eeb4dbad993f7c1484e . how to get around this? thanks.
