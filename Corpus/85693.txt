 URL : "https://github.com/elysium-project/server/issues/1720" TITLE : fix for thunderfury ppm 2 BODY : below is a proposed fix for bug https://elysium-project.org/bugtracker/issue/3649 previous fix applied in https://github.com/elysium-project/server/issues/41 however this was later broken again. later rejected with the view this should be in itemization due to timeline changes. however, i refute this reasoning as this was modified in response to a fundamental change in proc mechanics and threat values as documented in the bug tracker thread. additional resource material http://forum.nostalrius.org/viewtopic.php?f=24&t=703 update item_template set spellppmrate_1 = 7.8945 where entry = 19019;
