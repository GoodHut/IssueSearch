 URL : "https://github.com/copycat-killer/awesome-copycats/issues/172" TITLE : multihead wallpaper bug BODY : hi, as of awesome 4.0 it should be possible to provide a function to set the wallpaper. with this functionality one can set a different wallpaper for each screen. unfortunately all theme.lua files do break this behavior. see https://github.com/copycat-killer/awesome-copycats/blob/master/themes/multicolor/theme.lua l258 which overrides theme.wallpaper instead of using a local variable. this leads to having the function only called once. the original implementation as reference: https://github.com/awesomewm/awesome/blob/master/awesomerc.lua l174 cheers
