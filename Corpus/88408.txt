 URL : "https://github.com/zeit/next.js/issues/604" TITLE : next export static builds BODY : this might be built in if it's not too opinionated , or a separate core module if it has too many options . the idea is that one will be able to run next export and yield a build directory that _doesn't require a server_. - next export -o customdir should be possible - each page can optionally _precompute_ getinitialprops to have pre-rendered data when it's first loaded - the export config could live in next.config.js export object
