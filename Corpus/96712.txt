 URL : "https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/issues/2601" TITLE : fetch cpu frequency states BODY : feature request proposal: fetch cpu frequency states, governor current behavior: inputs.system does not show cpu frequency, sleep states etc. desired behavior: inputs.system should also fetch cpu frequency, sleep states etc. use case: why is this important helps with prioritizing requests lower cpu frequencys might impact services; lower frequencies might be forced when the temperature is too high or there are problems with the psu
