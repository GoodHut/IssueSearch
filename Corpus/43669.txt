 URL : "https://github.com/schae234/Camoco/issues/74" TITLE : database lock problem BODY : when trying to run overlap analysis jobs in parallel, using gnu parallel, whenever the second job starts, it soon fails with an apsw busyerror. i have tracked it down to the specific place https://github.com/schae234/camoco/blob/master/camoco/gwas.py l98 it is happening but i am still working to figure out what exactly is causing it, because short calls to the database shouldn't be locking it up.
