 URL : "https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-unity-sdk/issues/371" TITLE : create 3d simulator BODY : hello, id like to create a project and i would like to know if your asset makes the following possible. 1 import a map of a caribbean island. this map i would like to include buildings, mountains hills , and rivers dept if supplied by google 2 fill the rivers, with water fluid material and have it flowing. 3 can a fluid material be used as sea around an island. 4 can i change the material of slipperiness of a part of a mountain, to mimic a landslide. lets say change the mountain material to muddy and let gravity to the rest. i don't expect your asset to generate water for rivers. but looking at many models in unity3d it only shows a blue waterline that represents a river but i want a real river or real area for the river water to run, where i can raise water levels and cause it to over flow flood areas. also ability to edit liquidity of a selected area of mountain to mimic a landslide. regards
