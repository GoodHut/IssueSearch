 URL : "https://github.com/elysium-project/server/issues/1924" TITLE : skewed mc drop tables BODY : my guild have been in zelth'kur then in elysium raiding mc for some time and ever since i got in the guild i've noticed that the drop tables are not really random, but skewed towards warlocks, shamans and druids, exactly the classes we have less members. for example, in this week raid almost every boss had 1 warlock item. we are able to fully equip warlocks in one or two raids. it's ridiculous. each lock item should have close to 12% drop rate. that possibility of having a drop rate of 5 warlock tier items on raid with 10 bosses should be 0.002 %. we are we seeing this consistently every week. and i hear that all the time mc is being raided, the guild had about 3 weapon drops. for almost 6 months? with the exception of the shadowstrike which always drops. that's an item that should have a rate of 20% drop rate, but we measure it to be close 90%. please acknowledge and fix. thank you very much, miguel beefzor
