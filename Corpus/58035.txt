 URL : "https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-events-ios/issues/12" TITLE : rewrite tests in cedar BODY : this project has used protocols and and custom fakes classes that implement those protocols to facilitate testing that requires integration with other classes the library provides and/or framework functionality. although this has the benefit of not introducing any 3rd party testing frameworks as a project dependency, the downside is that not using a mocking framework makes the implementation more complex than it needs to be. since this library is written in objective-c and because introducing a development dependency should not create any new issues with integration of this library with other sdks and apps, we should switch to use the cedar https://github.com/pivotal/cedar testing framework. cedar includes a test double api and also allows for a cleaner, bdd style syntax that'll make the tests in this project easier to write, read, and maintain.
