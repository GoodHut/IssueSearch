 URL : "https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/issues/8042" TITLE : more operators please. BODY : feature request __proposal:__ implement the full complement of arithmetic operators including logical bitwise operators for and, or, not invert and xor. __current behavior:__ not currently supported. __desired behavior:__ ability to perform bitwise logical operations on integer field values. __use case:__ enable the use of field values as bit fields that can be easily queried with bitwise logical operators. we are instrumenting our applications and streaming measurements through a processing application in real-time. the application outputs measurements to influx in addition to identifying issues in real-time. e.g. stalling queues, counter resets - it can also detect issues over several measurements that are difficult to query for, such as a queue where latency is increasing over some period of time. we are raising events in our system when these things occur as they are important to us in real-time. it would also useful to pass through to influx the live detected status as bits within a field so we can query back these occurrences after the fact. e.g. we can query the number of times per month that a queue stalls, is reset or it's length exceeds a threshold where the thresholds may be different for each series and are not known to influx .
