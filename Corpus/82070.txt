 URL : "https://github.com/example42/puppet-tp/issues/38" TITLE : add dependency resolution BODY : i have a need to create a group installer and was curious if you would merge a feature like that into tiny puppet. this would make tiny puppet act more like a package manager than just a package installer. this would basically make installing stacks or groups of software easier but also allow for users to specify groups based on their own needs and have them predefined with tinydata. so a simple example would be a lamp stack or dev stack. the following function https://github.com/logicminds/cots/blob/master/lib/puppet/functions/cots/resolve.rb is what currently resolves dependencies and allows me to create groups. this would introduce a new dependency field for each app. i created a poc of such a feature in this project https://github.com/logicminds/cots. but would need to refactor some things to make it work with tiny puppet. i am considering using tiny-puppet instead because it does mostly what i want and much more than my poc.
