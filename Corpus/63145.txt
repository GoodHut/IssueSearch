 URL : "https://github.com/nomensa/Accessible-Media-Player/issues/33" TITLE : deprecated youtube api? BODY : hi there! the youtube js player api appears to be deprecated. the deprecation of the youtube javascript player api was announced on january 27, 2015. youtube flash <object> embeds have also been deprecated from https://developers.google.com/youtube/js_api_reference i'm working for a site that uses the nomensa amp, but the youtube videos have stopped working. it tries to access https://www.youtube.com/apiplayer?enablejsapi=1&version=3... this appears to be defined here: https://github.com/nomensa/accessible-media-player/blob/master/core/javascript/jquery.player.js l129 this project appears to have had no activity in the last two years, so is the nomensa accessible media player now effectively deprecated or are we missing something obvious? are there any plans to implement the iframe api https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference many thanks, finn
