 URL : "https://github.com/ggranga/fidolasen/issues/12" TITLE : add windows support BODY : s2_sen2cor can not be used under windows os it uses docker , and s2_list.r https://github.com/ggranga/fidolasen/blob/master/r/s2_list.r / s2_download.r https://github.com/ggranga/fidolasen/blob/master/r/s2_download.r have to be tested. to solve the problem: 1 allow install_s2download.r to install only python scripts without sen2cor; 2 test s2_list.r https://github.com/ggranga/fidolasen/blob/master/r/s2_list.r / s2_download.r https://github.com/ggranga/fidolasen/blob/master/r/s2_download.r under windows; 3 think for a different solution to use sen2cor on windows e.g. simply require to link the path of the executable, which has to be manually installed, and consequently adapt s2_sen2cor.r https://github.com/ggranga/fidolasen/blob/master/r/s2_sen2cor.r .
