BODY : hi, i am trying to install this tool on windows through wamp server but i could not run it! nothing install while following the instruction npm as indicated in the readme file is not an installable tool! and php is already part of wamp, however i could not install this journal! so, i am just wondering what is this tool exactly? is it a journal template or a journal software for life science publishing? or what exactly? what we can do with it? thank you
