 URL : "https://github.com/CoatiSoftware/SourcetrailBugTracker/issues/453" TITLE : local variable searching BODY : i'm currently trying to understand some very large functions, and often have to search for where a local variable is declared and used. the current behaviour of highlighting all references to a local symbol is nice, but i still have to scroll around and look carefully to find the declaration or other uses off-screen. for distinguishing the first use, i'd suggest either the ability to jump to the declaration of a local symbol like vim's gd or 1gd , or a different highlight colour once clicked for declaration. to make finding uses slightly easier which i think would be less useful than helping to get the declaration, but still quite nice i'd guess either a tooltip where you can select from the uses of that symbol in the current function similar to an emacs occur with the buffer narrowed to the function , or an alt-rightclick jumps to the next occurance while ctrl-rightclick jumps to the previous occurance similar to what the acme editor does on right-click by default .
