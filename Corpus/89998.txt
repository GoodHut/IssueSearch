 URL : "https://github.com/scholarslab/takeback/issues/32" TITLE : rethink collection titles BODY : in considering collections as a better discovery entry for items, we might revisit our collection names, and rephrase them to be structurally and grammatically consistent among other things. i'm drawn to consistently using a title/subtitle format. e.g. “a rape on campus”: the november 2014 article in _the rolling stone_.
