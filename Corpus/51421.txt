 URL : "https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/issues/1275" TITLE : alternatives for rpath BODY : thus in some modern distros rpath fails both in build-tree 1255 and after installation 1233 we should reconsider the default, or at least use a different method when -dcmake_skip_install_rpath=on is set. we have following possibilities: - do nothing, keep rpath as default, when compiling elektra on a problematic distro, the maintainer needs to set -dtarget_plugin_folder= - hardcode paths when loading plugins - installing /etc/ld.so.conf.d/elektra.conf with whatever was set as plugin path wont work when install_system_files is off - use runpath instead does not work on openwrt, to investigate if it works on all problematic distros. it is, however, less suited for our needs: using different plugins can be configured with kdb mount , thus there is no need to honor ld_library_path - switch to -dtarget_plugin_folder= as default, maybe together with @beku recommendation to group plugins according to their dependency. we should consider: - works everywhere without issues the most important one :smile: - if elektra is relocatable only target_plugin_folder as empty is, or when using $origin in rpath or runpath - works with every program e.g. setuid binaries and so on, all of the above would work, only when using $origin we would get into troubles, at least the elf specification recommends to ignore $origin in that case
