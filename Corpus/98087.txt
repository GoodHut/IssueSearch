 URL : "https://github.com/urbanindo/yii2-queue/issues/52" TITLE : impliment not acked status BODY : i wanted to go through all queue, for now i can't do it without acking messages.. for example i have 3 jobs but when i running listen i always see first job: running new process... running job : 7 running new process... running job : 7 running new process... running job : 7 ... so if we can add smth: $this->notack ; then it will be like: running new process... running job : 7 not acked! skipping.. running new process... running job : 6 not acked! skipping.. running new process... running job : 5 not acked! skipping.. and all unacked jobs will be in queue
