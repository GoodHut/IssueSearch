 URL : "https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1221" TITLE : windows admin rights BODY : i've installed this for a few different users in our environment. problem being not all of them have local admin rights on their windows machine. i've tried setting the acls on the program folder to give them full access on all objects and containers, but a few files either don't take the change the version file and conf files remain as administrators only whensetting perms with either icacls or set-acl or don't seem to inherit even though they have full control ntfs perms to tmp they receive an access denied when the agent tries to generate temporary files in it. mainly when they try to save changes to the conf file . is there a means to give non-admins sufficient privileges, or should i just create a local admin account they can use to run it?
