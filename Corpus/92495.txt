 URL : "https://github.com/plerup/makeEspArduino/issues/26" TITLE : wrong pins_arduino.h used BODY : i cannot get builds from the makefile to use the pin definitions for the specific board that i'm using node mcu 1.0 . as you'll see below, i specified board in the makefile as 'nodemcu' which as far as i can tell is the correct value. my simple sketch to test that i get the same behavior using the makefile as i get with the ide: void setup { pinmode led_builtin, output ; serial.begin 115200 ; delay 100 ; serial.printf led_builtin: %d , led_builtin ; } void loop { digitalwrite led_builtin, high ; delay 250 ; digitalwrite led_builtin, low ; delay 250 ; } my makefile looks like: sketch = esp8266_blink.ino upload_port = /dev/tty.wchusbserial1420 board = nodemcu include $ home /makeesparduino/makeesparduino.mk when i build and upload that using the arduino ide the builtin led blinks and the serial monitor tells me at led_builtin is pin 16. when i build and upload using the makefile, serial output tells me that it's using pin 1 i assume from the default esp8266 version of pins_arduino.h rather than nodemcu . if i change the sketch to refer to 16 explicitly for the pin, it works as expected, so this is just the wrong pin definition header being used.
