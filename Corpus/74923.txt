 URL : "https://github.com/hobbit-project/platform/issues/115" TITLE : fix user account problem BODY : problem keycloak offers to set a user account name which is used for logging in to the platform. however, gitlab is relying on the e-mail address only i.e., on its first part like max.power of max.power@example.org . we tried to tackle the problem by defining a clear guideline https://github.com/hobbit-project/platform/wiki/user-registration for the users in our wiki. however, a remaining problem is that the most users are not reading the guideline but are simply registering themself as for other services, i.e., they freely choose a user name. this leads to problems when they try to benchmark a system that they have uploaded. they can not see it in the gui because we only show systems of the user which have the user name in their url . discussion since a guideline does not work, we need to tackle this problem in a different way. i could imagine different approaches the order is random and does not imply a weighting and i would be happy to have a discussion regarding this. 1. adapt registration. we could try to adapt the registration process in keycloak to make sure that the user name can not be chosen but is determined based on the mail address. 1. extend the user information known by the gui. if the gui knows the mail address of the user, it could use the first part to check the urls of systems. 1. get user rights from gitlab. instead of relying on the url of a system, it should be possible to use gitlabs api to derive whether a given user can see a project and its containers. this would enable the users to define whether other users can benchmark their systems by using the visibility feature of gitlab projects. additionally, it would enable the usage of project groups/teams in gitlab. feel free to comment the approaches or present additional ways.
