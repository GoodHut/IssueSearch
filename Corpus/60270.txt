 URL : "https://github.com/ruslo/polly/issues/149" TITLE : xctest support for ios BODY : the issue with xctest, ios support and polly toolchain is the cmake_osx_sysroot value. it is set to iphoneos , while xctest unit testing of frameworks is allowed only for simulator. this is why xctest symbols are not found for x86_64 architecture when trying to run the test, as all the paths are calculated from /applications/xcode.app/contents/developer/platforms/iphoneos.platform/.... if you change cmake_osx_sysroot to iphonesimulator in polly ios toolchain, xctest will work. checked on the project https://github.com/kitware/cmake/tree/master/tests/xctest with changed polly/ios-10-3.cmake toolchain and it works you have to remove from static lib and below from cmakelists.txt there to make it work . is there a way to make xctest work with ios & polly toolchain without patching? it seems that changing the variable to iphonesimulator raises issues with building boost libraries, that is a stopper for this approach. thanks
