BODY : i'm getting myself ramped up to help out and looking at moving the mastery pages to v3 is there an open issue for this? . since v3 doesn't support batch, i'm just creating a request per summoner id at the new v3 endpoint. the unit test requests masteries for 11 summoners. however, i keep getting rate limited. other unit tests fail due to rate limiting as well, so it's not just isolated to the new code. i change ratelimiter.tenseconds to 11 seconds and my test and others pass. i've stared at this for a couple days now and i'm not seeing the issue other than it seems timing related. changing ratelimiter.tenseconds to 11 seems like a hack, so any advice on debugging this?
