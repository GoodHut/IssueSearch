 URL : "https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/cordova-plugin-safariviewcontroller/issues/65" TITLE : cross site scripting ideas BODY : my current login process involves google oauth redirecting to a server route that redirects with a cookie. so the client javascript never touches the token and everything is very secure. however with the approach you outlined, i would have to pass the token directly through a custom url scheme myapp://password and this opens us up to xss potential. any ideas how we could avoid this? perhaps the cordova browser could share session cookies with safari?
