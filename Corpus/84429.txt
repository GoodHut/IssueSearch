 URL : "https://github.com/7ojo/perl6-platform/issues/24" TITLE : custom name for container BODY : containers are currently named after the directory of the dockerfile. i would like to see an option for a custom name. one use case for this is name spacing the created containers without having to include the name space in the directory name. an example: let's say i have a directory xyz having subdirectories server and test . server has a dockerfile to build the server and test has a dockerfile to build tests for the server . i would like the respective containers to be named xyz-server and xyz-test without having to change the directory names.
