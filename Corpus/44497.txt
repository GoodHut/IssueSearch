 URL : "https://github.com/EmbeddedMontiArc/onlineIDE/issues/14" TITLE : extend javascript api BODY : please extend the 8 javascript api about the following functions: 1. add a javascript function open filename to open a corresponding file 2. add a rest url to open files in the editor and to set the cursor on one of the files at a given line like ide.embeddedmontiarc.com/ide.htm?mountplace=xyz&files= file1, file2, file3 &cursor=file1@13 whereby file1@13 means that the file1 at line 13 has the position. the point 1. is used for the generated svg it should replace the following <rect onclick= window.open 'bumperbot.bumperbot.sensors.html','_parent',false /> with a <rect onclick= opensubcomponent 'bumperbot.bumperbot.sensors.html' /> and opensubcomponent file calls window.open file,'_parent',false to draw the new subcomponent and open file to open the new subcomponent. >> maybe you can change only the bumperbot.bumperbot.svg in the demos repo to show manual how he should adapt the freemarker template. the point 2. is used later for tutorials. adapt the documentation for both extensions. thank you.
