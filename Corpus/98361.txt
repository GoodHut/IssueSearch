 URL : "https://github.com/graphcool-examples/react-native-graphql/issues/13" TITLE : integrate react navigation BODY : thank you so much for the react-native-graphql example! : it clarifies a lot for me. but i'm still struggling with the integration of react-community/react-navigation ... for more complex apps theres no way around a stack navigator and the react navigation is the de facto standard. maybe you could add it to this example or create another that uses it?
