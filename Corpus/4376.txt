 URL : "https://github.com/jantman/repostatus.org/issues/22" TITLE : change concept BODY : i would propose to change the description of the status concept to include ideas that are just being tried out. concept in my mind serves as two kind of things: 1. the status in which all repos start. just being a concept, some rough ideas are drawn out. no real work towards a stable version is put into it. 2. the repo simply illustrates something and is never intended to move towards a stable version or product. this may also include that during development the team noticed that there is a better way but this code still serves as a base for that approach. my personal examples are exercises i did to understand one page frameworks in javascript. i build at least the scaffold for multiple such frameworks to understand underlying problems and approaches but really they are just concepts and never meant for production. > minimal or no implementation has been done yet or an idea is just being tried. would be my suggestion as a base to work from. you may find more detailes on my thought process and a bigger picture of how statuses could relate in https://github.com/jantman/repostatus.org/issues/19 issuecomment-290917577
