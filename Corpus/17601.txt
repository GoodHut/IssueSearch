 URL : "https://github.com/rsheftel/raccoon/issues/3" TITLE : python 2 support? BODY : hi there, this is a neat project that might help me with something i'm working on that doesn't lend itself well to how pandas works. problem is i do most of my work in python 2.7. it didn't take long for me to make your code 2.x compatible -- mostly just replaced some of the list.copy s with list : s and removed the type hints. if you're interested i can send a pr -- if not i'll just keep using what i have.
