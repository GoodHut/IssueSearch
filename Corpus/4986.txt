 URL : "https://github.com/CastawayLabs/cachet-monitor/issues/55" TITLE : ip devices up? BODY : i know that cachet-monitor can ping url but i would like to use this to also check if an actual device is responding. is it possible with cachet-monitor and i am just missing something in the config file? even better would be specifying a port as well...
