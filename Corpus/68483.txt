 URL : "https://github.com/openmaptiles/openmaptiles/issues/181" TITLE : runways and coastlines? BODY : i have successfully did some small moddifications to my data, like at what zoomlevel are what lake-data used. must say its much easier to moddificate now than with old osm2vectortiles : have 2 questions tought: 1. how to get airport runways showing up? 2. how to get coastline? fill-outline works for ne_10m_lakes but not for osm-data as its in blocks. i have used osm bright as base for my custom style.
