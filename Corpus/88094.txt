 URL : "https://github.com/uzumaxy/pymodbus3/issues/9" TITLE : modbus serial sync server BODY : i've just tried instantiating a modbus rtu serial synchronous server. it seems that the classes in pymodbus3/server/sync.py expect a serial.serial object to have the same api as a socket - ie. to have send and recv methods, while what it actually has are read and write methods. am i missing something?
