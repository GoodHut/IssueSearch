 URL : "https://github.com/Laex/Delphi-OpenCV/issues/96" TITLE : custom camera resolution BODY : hi guys, was a long time. here, i have a request for improvement. i run a camera in r1624x1234 format. it is not listed in the standard ocv.comp.source.pas. each time you upgrade your wrapper, i have to update the list of the enum tocvresolution with my own custom value and some other places as well . it would be great that you include this format of camera... that would works for me. but, a lot of other users would like to have their own format included. so i would propose the following: 1 - you increase the tocvresolution with a custom element 2 - you add two new properties in the camera class tocvcamerasource . you add customwidth and customheight. 3 - in the methode setresolution, you check if the custom is defined as value parameter and then use the two new properties to set fwidth and fweight. would work for anyone. thank for this one. hugues
