 URL : "https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/issues/1624" TITLE : move access keys into l10n BODY : the access keys for context menus need to correspond to the label that is being presented in the menu item. however since the labels are translated, if a translation uses a different phrase the key may need to be changed to match the new phrase and there is no way for a translator to do that right now. see l10n https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/docs/local-development.md l10n for info getting setup. step 1: move all access keys to strings.json https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/src/strings.json and debugger.properties https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/assets/locales/debugger.properties step 2: review all access keys to ensure they are useful for the labels and are unique to the menu being shown.
