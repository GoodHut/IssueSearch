BODY : right now the user has the option to load a texture as srgb, which means converting it from gamma corrected space to linear space. however, in order to store textures in linear space, we need to use higher-precision textures, as well as handle both cases which isn't currently being done, all albedo textures are assumed to be in srgb space even though they aren't . this causes two concerns: 1. it's more work. all albedo textures have to manually be marked as srgb, which people aren't currently doing. 2. textures take up more vram. the alternative is to remove the option and treat all textures the same. this means converting from gamma corrected space to linear space in the shader when sampling the texture. 1. less work when importing textures. 2. less vram usage. 3. we don't need to handle different cases. 4. we can remove the texture meta .json files since the only information they contain is whether the texture should be loaded as srgb. 5. potentially more expensive since we have to do one additional pow in the fragment shader how expensive is this compared to sampling from higher-precision buffers? depends on memory bandwidth/throughput .
