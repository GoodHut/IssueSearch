 URL : "https://github.com/MaslowCNC/GroundControl/issues/178" TITLE : zoom with keyboard BODY : on the raspberry pi it isn't possible to zoom with the mouse scroll wheel so we need a keyboard option for zooming. page up/down is a good option. ideally it would be a user selectable key from within the settings menu. i've seen some people using those usb number pads which just have arrow keys, numbers and page up/down as controllers for cnc machines. it seems like they work well because you don't truly need a full keyboard.
