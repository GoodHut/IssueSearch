 URL : "https://github.com/ConvertKit/ConvertKit-WordPress/issues/72" TITLE : update use of transient BODY : several customers have reported that they will add a form in convertkit, then go to their wp site and look for it on the settings page. the settings page uses a transient for the api call so it might take up to 5 minutes for the form to refresh. either: 1. add a way to clear the transient or 2. do not use transient if on the admin settings page
