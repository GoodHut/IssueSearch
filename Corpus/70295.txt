 URL : "https://github.com/trustin/sphinx-gradle-plugin/issues/3" TITLE : using multiple builders BODY : there doesn't seem to be any way to specify multiple builders in a single sphinx run. this is the case for both this plugin as well as the main sphinx cli tool. that's fine, running sphinx twice is acceptable, however, i'm having problems getting the sphinx-gradle-plugin to do that. what i've tried is to create a separate task of type sphinxtask and put a sphinx{} block into that task: project :documentation { task generatetext type: kr.motd.gradle.sphinx.gradle.sphinxtask { sphinx { sourcedirectory = ${project.projectdir} outputdirectory = build/documentation/text builder = text } } task generatehtml type: kr.motd.gradle.sphinx.gradle.sphinxtask { sphinx { sourcedirectory = ${project.projectdir} outputdirectory = build/documentation/text builder = html } } } which does not work. the only thing i've gotten to work is this: project ':documentation' { apply plugin: kr.motd.sphinx sphinx { sourcedirectory = ${project.projectdir} outputdirectory = build/documentation/html builder = html } } but the problem with this is that i can only use one builder and i need to create multiple projects somehow to specify multiple sphinx blocks within each project but then i'll have to override the project directory so that both of these project run within the same context. am i overlooking something? is there a simple way to run sphinx with multiple builders on the same source?
