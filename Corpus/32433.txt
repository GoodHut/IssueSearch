 URL : "https://github.com/lucasconstantino/redux-transient/issues/3" TITLE : usage doc confusion BODY : the docs contain this usage: javascript import { enhancer } from 'redux-transient' const store = createstore reducers, 0, enhancer this did not seem to work with composed enhancers: javascript import { enhancer } from 'redux-transient' const combinedenhancer = compose transientenhancer, otherenhancer ; const store = createstore reducers, 0, combinedenhancer reading the code, it appears this is the way to use the enhance function, which does work for me: javascript transientenhancer createstore reducer, initialstate, otherenhancer ;
