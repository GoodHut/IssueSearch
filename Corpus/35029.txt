 URL : "https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester/issues/548" TITLE : custom path mappings BODY : previous versions of w-c-t allowed to define custom path mappings in the options given to wct.test . with 6.0.0 switching to polyserve that doesn't work anymore, but it seems that polyserve could provide a replacement functionality with the additionalroutes mapping. unfortunately there is no way to provide additional routes, as webserver.ts just creates a new map: https://github.com/polymer/web-component-tester/blob/v6.0.0/runner/webserver.ts l65. could you initialize the map with values from the options please? this would allow us to provide our custom path mappings again.
