 URL : "https://github.com/pygeode/pygeode/issues/102" TITLE : support for python 3 BODY : this should be done in such a way that python 2.7 is still supported but not 2.6 or earlier? . our regular python scripts can be converted with 2to3 https://docs.python.org/2/library/2to3.html , but our extension modules will be a bit tricky. found some info here http://python3porting.com/cextensions.html which may help.
