 URL : "https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/issues/216" TITLE : add spir-v codegen BODY : we would like to extend directxshadercompiler so it can compile hlsl into spir-v for vulkan. hlsl is the prevalent shading language nowadays and directxshadercompiler is the reference compiler for hlsl. therefore we believe this effort will benefit the general graphics ecosystem. the general approach is to directly translate frontend ast into spir-v words. main components involved include: spir-v builder classes spir-v codegen from ast parser support for key vulkan concepts e.g., descriptor bindings and specialization constants ast semantic analysis for vulkan e.g., checking constraints and possibly transforming the ast to map to vulkan semantics associated tests this does not reflect the order of implementation. currently we have the basic spir-v infrastructure spir-v builder classes, astfrontendaction , and command line integration ready and will upstream them soon. for more details about the logistics and design choices, please see docs/spir-v.rst currently in pr 215 .
