BODY : i used the paired t-test to analyse my pre/post data, and the spm graph displayed the dotted line at t =2.624. if my understanding is correct, should this t line also appear at the negative axis? with any value <-2.624 having p<0.05? if so, what do i need to alter in the code to display this negative t line? in my notes from the workshop i attended at isb, this should be automatic? i am happy to attach the output from the code if i haven't explained clearly. thanks in advance, alexis
