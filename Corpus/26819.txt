 URL : "https://github.com/crsh/papaja/issues/166" TITLE : cannot coerce class BODY : hi there, i work in rmarkdown in rstudio newest version of r and rstudio . the apa_print and the apa_print.lm functions worked without problem for me. however, now i noticed that i get an error when i execute the command even though in the docx document, it still prints the values correctly. any idea how i can fix the error? because i cannot make new apa_print objects...the correlation and t.test i can print without trouble. however, with the lm model everything should be fine.... this is the error i get: error in as.data.frame.default x i , optional = true, stringsasfactors = stringsasfactors : cannot coerce class structure annotated_character , package = papaja to a data.frame
