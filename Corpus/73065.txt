 URL : "https://github.com/dziemborowicz/hourglass/issues/149" TITLE : commandline -file option BODY : i have a question for the command line part. throughout the day i've got to verify 40 import files at different time moments. so i created a cmd file with lots of hourglass instances. would it be -nice to have- a schedule-file where you could store these 'lines'? having one instance running, and pops-ups when the timer expires at each schedule. hourglass.exe -file c:\program files x86 \hourglass\myschedules.txt options would be stored into this txt/ini/hourglass file.
