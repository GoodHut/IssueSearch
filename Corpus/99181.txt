 URL : "https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod-notebooks/issues/10" TITLE : markdown link in readme.md BODY : there is a simple _bug_ in readme.md the markdown link to _the moran process_ notebook does not render properly. the moran process moran process.ipynb i guess you know the solution: just change the link to the moran process moran%20process.ipynb . even better: change the notebook filename to moran-process.ipynb and link to the moran process moran-process.ipynb cheers
