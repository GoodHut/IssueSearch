 URL : "https://github.com/inbflat/colmar/issues/5" TITLE : use of class 'darker' BODY : https://github.com/inbflat/colmar/blob/master/index.html l33 good intentions using the class darker to set the darker background color for the various sections that require that. but, i think in this case it actually makes it a little more confusing. you can just assign that background color on a case by case basis where it is needed. also, try something like http://www.colorzilla.com/ to grab the exact color needed for those sections
