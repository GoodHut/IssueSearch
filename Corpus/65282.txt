 URL : "https://github.com/nickboucher32/nova/issues/2" TITLE : include uc logo on site BODY : currently, the uc logo and name is in the <title> , but i think we should include it on the page itself for instance, in the header bar or the footer so that users know what exactly it is. it's also great publicity for the uc!
