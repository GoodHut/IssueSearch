 URL : "https://github.com/OWASP/Top10/issues/133" TITLE : rc2 - a2 authentication BODY : https://github.com/owasp/top10/blob/master/2017/en/0xa2-authentication.md the phrase credential stuffing isn't widely used. you might want to add a small to it and a link to the owasp article at the bottom there is a link later on but you don't want the reader to get to the bottom of the section without knowing what it means . here's the link: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/credential_stuffing users who you might have a legal relationship -> normal users since you mentioned nist, nist says that pbkdf2 is also approved i think as well as others , not just argon2 not sure how many libraries are currently available for argon2 implement weak password checks, such as testing a new password against a list of the top 10000 worst passwords nist does recommend getting rid of complexity rules, but at least we should encourage longer passwords nist recommends a minimum of 8 up to 64 in cases where mfa can't be implemented. when credential stuffing, brute force or other attacks -> when credential stuffing, brute force or other attacks occur add a link to worst password lists: https://github.com/danielmiessler/seclists/tree/master/passwords implement rate limiting to limit the impact of automated attacks, credential stuffing, brute force, and default password attacks . i think this is impractical to ask people to use this for all applications. in fact, if my memory serves me correctly, i think this was reserved for level 2 or even level 3 applications in asvs. asking users to add this is impractical perhaps just have it as a recommendation at the end of this section perhaps add an increased password length with no complexity rules as a fall back mechanism if mfa is not an option or is too difficult to implement no mention of protecting the different authentication channels password reset, etc. and enumerating valid users
