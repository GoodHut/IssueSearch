 URL : "https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector/issues/819" TITLE : add !!/approve command BODY : with the new pullapprove integration, it'd be nice if we could add an !!/approve to the issue from se chat. this will probably need the following changes: - code admin access level will need to be checked in smokey. - user that requested the pr still shouldn't be able to approve it or should they? . this is assuming the approval will be posted as either smokey or metasmoke and just mention which user approved it possibly with a link to chat
