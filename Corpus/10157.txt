 URL : "https://github.com/tmills/uhhmm/issues/48" TITLE : bad sample error BODY : i had a cpu run going of the current version and it crashed after a little more than 400 iterations because it sampled a g value of 0. i haven't seen this error before, so it may be newly introduced. i'm starting an otherwise identical run with the gpu in order to see whether the problem replicates there.
