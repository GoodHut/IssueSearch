 URL : "https://github.com/andrejv/wxmaxima/issues/912" TITLE : copy as latex BODY : hi, i use wxmaxima regularly, but one behavior i really dislike. i think that the latex generated with the copy as latex from the contextual menu is hard to read. the biggest issue being the number of braces { and } . since also the output of the maxima's tex function is not much better, some time ago i put together some regular expressions to simplify the tex code i usually get. you can have a a look here https://astyonax.github.io/bettertex4wxmaxima/, it's my sandbox for this task. i'm wondering whether it's possible and there is interest to reach a consensus on a set of regular expressions that wxmaxima may apply when doing the copy as latex . best,
