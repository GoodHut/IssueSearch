 URL : "https://github.com/danielbastos11/gitdox/issues/1" TITLE : add readme ironic, huh? BODY : i didn't have the time to do it yet. the readme should cover: 1. what is the project about 2. how to use it 3. how to customize behavior by supplying diffent streams 4. api using gitdox itself would be so cool!
