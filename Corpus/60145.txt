 URL : "https://github.com/KevinMarquette/PlasterTemplates/issues/17" TITLE : why updatesource task? BODY : after the build i notice that module .psd1 source file is overwritten with the generated one from the output directory. i then have to remember to discard the changes that are made the version number and the explicit list of functions to export . neither of these changes need to be included in the source file as they can be computed. i specifically do not want these changes to be included in the source file so as to reduce merge conflicts when branching. so to that end are you happy for me to remove the updatesource from the module.build.ps1 ?
