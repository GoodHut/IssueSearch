 URL : "https://github.com/mmozeiko/RcloneBrowser/issues/49" TITLE : request: rename file BODY : the current version does not allow renaming of files. or it does not work as expected. it just appends a new folder and moves the incorrectly named file into the folder it created. the folder that is created is the name that you wanted the file called. i know that rclone did not support file renames, hence the behaviour i guess, but with the latest rclone version file renames work using the moveto https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_moveto/ command. can this function please be implemented into rclone browser. that would make it the ultimate tool to manage a headless server. many thanks for all the great work on the project.
