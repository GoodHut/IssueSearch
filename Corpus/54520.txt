 URL : "https://github.com/nodejs/automation/issues/4" TITLE : github team management BODY : 1. anyone interested in joining but does not have the team admin access, please indicate your interest in this thread. btw node.js organization owners should have the access 2. i did not make this team a child team of build because that would grant access to repos that contain secrets and stuff. i am not that well-versed with github teams so let me know if there is a better way to organize things better
