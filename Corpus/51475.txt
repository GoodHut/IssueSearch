 URL : "https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/issues/2918" TITLE : api for swift generics BODY : i am using asdk at swift. thank you. i want some apis that correspond to generics. for example asdisplaynode.ondidload swift let collectionnode = ascollectionnode collectionnode.ondidload { node: asdisplaynode in // <- ðŸ¤” } currently the closure argument becomes superclass. when used with swift, the closure argument should also be ascollectionnode. this correspondence may be difficult with the objective-c bridge. like realm, how about developing realm module and realmswift module separately?
