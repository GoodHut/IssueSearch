 URL : "https://github.com/StylishThemes/GitHub-Dark-Script/issues/27" TITLE : disable the style? BODY : can i permanently disable the style while using the plugin so the code-wrapping and monospaced textarea still works ? currently when i click to a new page, there is a white flash before the css takes place. i would like to use this plugin while keeping css in stylish to get rid of the white flash . the checkbox of enable github dark doesn't seem to persist across pages, or across refresh.
