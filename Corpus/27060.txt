 URL : "https://github.com/CityOfBoston/boston.gov/issues/583" TITLE : codered signup form BODY : background we need to build a new signup form for the city of boston emergency alert system. codered is an emergency alerts system procured by doit / office of emergency alerts. we were asked to help simplify the signup form, which is quite long. doing discovery, we learned that any tweaks to the form as it currently exists are impossible. we also learned that there is existing api documentation for sending information into the system. we also learned that there is a serious signup issue. a user who signs up on the current contact form but lists their address as outside of boston doesn’t get alerts from us. we can only send alerts to the boston geographic area. that user instead gets put into a codered national database, over which we have no control. current: sign-up form: https://public.coderedweb.com/cne/en-us/bfb5f355fab8 forms transition ticket: https://github.com/cityofboston/forms/issues/332 - kpis - - signup conversion rate - - - baseline -- codered doesn't track - - - target -- ability to track - - qualitative - - - baseline -- we’ve gotten several complaints about the signup flow as well as messaging around it. - - - target -- reduce complaints to near-zero.
