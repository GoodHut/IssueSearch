 URL : "https://github.com/project64/project64/issues/1291" TITLE : ips/bps soft patch support BODY : don't know why never anyone asked for this feature, this can be helpful if you don't want to hard patch your roms. i was trying to add this feature to project64, but since i'm awful at programming it seems difficult for me.
