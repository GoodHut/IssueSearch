 URL : "https://github.com/phpseclib/mcrypt_compat/issues/7" TITLE : the package is not full BODY : hello there, when i install it through composer i don't get the full mcrypt.php as it is in your published folder. for example, i don't see: function mcrypt_get_iv_size $cipher, $mode { return phpseclib_mcrypt_get_iv_size $cipher, $mode ; } in the mcrypt.php when i installed through composer however see it in the zip archive. so i had to manually upload the zip package and replace mcrypt.php with that which in the zip package. would it be possible to fix that please? thank you
