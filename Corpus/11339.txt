 URL : "https://github.com/Asus-T100/kernel/issues/5" TITLE : gnss 4752 driver BODY : i got a link from a forum post that you were working on getting a driver written for broadcom's gnss 4752 devices. i've been trying to get the one on my tablet to work as well. my efforts are documented here http://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=132661 if there's anything i can do to help, i would be glad to. i'm working on sniffing the communication to the device in windows 10 right now since i can't get it to talk and i suspect it needs to be initialized somehow. i'm working on a toshiba encore 2, i've noticed the t100 and the encore are very close in terms of hardware. most of the patches that work on my encore have been taken from different models of the t100.
