 URL : "https://github.com/ServUO/ServUO/issues/2100" TITLE : item set fix needs revert BODY : this has already been fixed before. the one problem remained with that set only...maybe a few others but should have been changed at the set level. before you would just add the total resist bonus to here and you would get setphysicalbonus = 2; setfirebonus = 2; setcoldbonus = 2; setpoisonbonus = 2; setenergybonus = 2; +2 to the total set not each piece. now with the new changes check out the sorcerers set..which was coded to use the new set items, that was changed months ago. attach=full 8851 /attach please revert asap. again the way it was working was you coded the resist per piece and then the setphysicalbonus, ect as long as all was the same number just added that number once to the end. now all other sets, except for the set that was reported that triggered this issue is out of wac. reported by: tasanar report thread: http://servuo.com/threads/item-set-fix-needs-revert.7291/
