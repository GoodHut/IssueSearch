 URL : "https://github.com/CodeYellowBV/mobx-spine/issues/15" TITLE : add support for moment BODY : it should be easier to work with the moment library. if it is detected that a property contains moment , like this: class animal extends model { @observable startedat = moment ; } perhaps we can automatically ensure that if you do e.g. .parse { startedat: '2017-03-22t19:05:46+00:00' } , it will use moment. also in tobackend we can ensure it is parsed to iso 8601.
