 URL : "https://github.com/lukeautry/tsoa/issues/59" TITLE : number type and decimal BODY : we can not use parameters validation with number if we expect float/decimal because there are always parsed as int... typescript const parsednumber = parseint numbervalue, 10 ; change to parsefloat maybe as float is a superset of int. or maybe implements a type 'float' decorator or something. best regards.
