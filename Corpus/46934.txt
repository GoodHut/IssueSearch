 URL : "https://github.com/mik3y/usb-serial-for-android/issues/191" TITLE : new maintainer wanted BODY : hi folks! i'm looking for someone to take over as maintainer for this project. as you can see, i haven't had the time to do so. and i no longer have the devices to test, either! the new maintainer would have responsibility over reviewing submitted prs, triaging issues, improving the code and publishing new releases. ideally, you've already submitted prs and/or maintain a fork, or have a track record from another open source project. if you're interested, please leave a note below.
