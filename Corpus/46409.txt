 URL : "https://github.com/IMAGINARY/soe-js/issues/11" TITLE : make undo great again BODY : if one geodesic or loxadrome is drawn the undo stack is cleared of previous ones because there can only be one tm highlander . ideally it should redraw previous geodesics or loxadromes.. this requires more complex handling. consider keeping several geo/loxa curves on the screen at the same time.
