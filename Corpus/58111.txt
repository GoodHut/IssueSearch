 URL : "https://github.com/mgattozzi/rust-from-lang/issues/2" TITLE : rust from java-scripts BODY : hi great library, i've been learning java-scripts from last week, but i see lots of people say rust is much faster. my website is slow, anti-virus complains that i install viruses. can rust go faster??? i would like rust-from-java-scripts, can it be ready next week? i want to learn rust and make web-scale website with mongodb and rust ... ----------------- i'm only being silly ðŸ˜† , this is a great idea! i've resolved to learn rust this year coming from java kotlin, scala , python, js. i found learning kotlin and scala much easier last year by spending some time on the basics and reading the ${new-language} -is-like-$ {language-i-know} type : swift-is-like-kotlin/ https://nilhcem.github.io/swift-is-like-kotlin/ python to scala https://wrobstory.gitbooks.io/python-to-scala/content/ other than haskell, which i'm unfamiliar with, i look forward to seeing what the rust community write about so it can help us learn and transition into rust-lang!
