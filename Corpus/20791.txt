 URL : "https://github.com/larsgw/citation.js/issues/27" TITLE : csl is not defined BODY : hi, hope this is an appropriate question, being an utter newb. good chance i'm just missing something obvious, but i can't figure out what.. trying to get it run from the browser, i get the following error: uncaught referenceerror: csl is not defined at citation-0.2.js:2487 which corresponds to: , window: {} , wdk: require 'wikidata-sdk' } : { csl: csl , striptags: function html { var tmp = document.createelement 'div' tmp.innerhtml = html return tmp.textcontent || tmp.innertext || '' } the cli interface works fine, though i had to first pass the package through the wrap-cmd package to get it create a .cmd file on my windows machine. i'm trying to incorporate it into my jekyll page, which already parses a csl-json file into a rudimentary bibliography. thank you for your work! lem
