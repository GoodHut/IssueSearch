 URL : "https://github.com/brennier/quicktex/issues/9" TITLE : quicktex doesn't trigger BODY : i installed quicktex with vundle, but i can't get the expansion to trigger in a .tex file. so far, i have tried both with and without the readme.md dictionaries in my .vimrc. tried with and without manually setting g:quicktex_trigger and g:quicktex_usedefault enabled and disabled. have tried uninstalling all other plugins to eliminate quicktex conflicting with something else. so i'm stumped. what am i doing wrong?
