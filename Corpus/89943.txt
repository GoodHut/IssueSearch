 URL : "https://github.com/fabiomaffioletti/jsondoc/issues/239" TITLE : requestparam name ignored BODY : description --- it appears that jsondoc is ignoring the name attribute of the requestparam annotation. the value attribute works as expected, despite the former being an alias for the latter. steps to reproduce --- attempt to generate documentation for a method like the following java @requestmapping value = public void authenticate @requestparam username string username, @requestparam password string password, @requestparam required = false, name = source string source throws ioexception {/ ... /} expected outcome --- the three query parameters username , password , source are present in the resulting documentation. actual outcome --- source is not present in the resulting documentation, instead the parameter is shown with no name, and the following error is present in a notice above the parameter descriptions: - missing documentation data: query parameter name suggested resolution --- treat value and name as synonyms, since that is what spring does.
