 URL : "https://github.com/Hexsphere/hexsphere.github.io/issues/3" TITLE : use <p> instead of <br/> BODY : under the my bio heading, use multiple <p></p> elements instead of using <br/> elements. this breaks up the text, making it more easy on the eye. and gives your document a better semantic structure you should also aim to break up the text under the history of this website into multiple paragraphs for the same reason - nobody wants to read a sentence that spans over 4 lines.
