 URL : "https://github.com/aclu-people-power/map/issues/67" TITLE : can't clear date filters BODY : if you set a start/end date filter, you cannot unset it. because it's represented in the query string, if you reload the page, that will not work either. suggestion: nullify respective date filter in the store when user manually clears the text input, or create some additional ui to clear it. other ideas welcome.
