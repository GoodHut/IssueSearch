 URL : "https://github.com/prestodb/presto/issues/7189" TITLE : add support for mapr BODY : for background on previous work see https://github.com/prestodb/presto/pull/1658 and https://github.com/prestodb/presto/pull/1669. this issue tracks the work needed to get mapr support for presto on par with that for hdp and cdh. we plan on bundling and shading the mapr dependencies like we do for other hadoop distros. for this purpose i've created this project: https://github.com/teradata/presto-hadoop-mapr5. so far we've managed to query data in mapr fs with minimal code changes mostly around configuration, nothing in the engine itself . we also built a docker container with mapr and are currently trying to run all the presto product tests on mapr to see if any queries won't work.
