 URL : "https://github.com/timberio/agent/issues/112" TITLE : single file gets tailed BODY : i introduced a bug in 0.4.0 that caused only the last specified file in a configuration to be tailed, regardless of how many files were specified. the changes being made in 111 by ben should fix this, however, i wanted to track this bug separately from the file globbing issue in 58 so that anyone affected by the bug can follow along. due to the changes in 111 and still being pre-1.0, we'll probably fix this in 0.5 despite it being a bug affecting 0.4.
