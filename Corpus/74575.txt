 URL : "https://github.com/mohuk/ts-jsonapi/issues/4" TITLE : export serializeroptions BODY : i'm new to learning typescript, but it seems like i can't use this library because it doesn't export serializeroptions . if i try to pass {} when creating a serializer, i get argument of type '{}' is not assignable to parameter of type 'serializeroptions' . if i try to type {}, i get cannot find name 'serializeroptions' . am i missing something? it seems like serializeroptions needs to be exported in index.ts or in serializer.ts so i can import it as a type and use it when i'm using the library.
