 URL : "https://github.com/javiexin/template/issues/1" TITLE : retrieve full blocks BODY : now, it is only possible to retrieve specific vars from a block. there should be a possibility to retrieve complete blocks, without the need to specify the complete list of vars to retrieve. to do: if $vararray param to retrieve_block_vars is array , all block variables are returned. only excluded vars are those that are calculated from the block position in the template tree. the returned array may be used to directly insert it as a block in another tree position reordering, or restructuring .
