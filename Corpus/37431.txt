 URL : "https://github.com/wright-group/WrightSim/issues/16" TITLE : make mu more general BODY : perhaps go to using an ordereddict for mu , rather than the list which aligns with the states of rho i was originally under the impression that that would work, but realize now that it does not. we need a way to track the label of mu with the value. direct indexing is nice for portability to c implementation for cuda. the labels won't be tracked
