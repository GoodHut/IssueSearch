 URL : "https://github.com/kroniak/extensions-ecwid/issues/39" TITLE : discount coupons api BODY : it looks like the discount coupons api https://developers.ecwid.com/api-documentation/discount-coupons is not yet implemented. is there any reason why i shouldn't have a crack at it and submit a pr? i assume following the existing pattern of code should be fine. creating a partial class ecwidclientdiscountcoupons . from what i can see i won't be able to implement the 'real' tests, as the mocky api will need to be set up.
