BODY : hi, can you clone a state? from reading the comment in the code i thought just passing the first state like this might work, but i get an error. luastate2 = new luavm.lua.state luastate ; i'm still working on my loading of game prototype from 57 and would like to compare the change made by mod to the main game prototypes. basically i load the game lua files. copy the current game prototypes to a variable. load the mod and then compare the change between the game + mod prototypes with the original one. since loading the game file is a good half second and i have to do it for every mod in the game. possibly hundreds, i was wondering if it was possible to just clone the state after loading the game file and then destroy the clone once i'm done with one mod. also what's the best way to destroy a state? since it would be asyncronous i need to free all the memory that was used. thanks!
