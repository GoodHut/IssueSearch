 URL : "https://github.com/OpenTrons/opentrons/issues/293" TITLE : tip pick up BODY : on previous versions of the app, the tip pick up would consist of 3 steps. the pipette goes into the tip, picks it up and then goes back into the tip back with a little force to make sure the tip is secure. on v2.5.0 onwards there is just one step when picking up the tip. untitled folder.zip https://github.com/opentrons/opentrons/files/1226095/untitled.folder.zip
