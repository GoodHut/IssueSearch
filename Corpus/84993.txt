 URL : "https://github.com/panva/node-openid-client/issues/58" TITLE : editing issuer iss values BODY : i'm using this excellent library to connect to https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/authorize unfortunately, microsoft uses a somewhat proprietary take on their .well-known/openid-configuration template. { issuer : https://sts.windows.net/{tenantid}/ // the issue ... } they are specifying a template where they expect the client to replace the tag {tenantid} with an arbitrary value. i am not looking for template support in node-openid-client. i'm trying to find a way to hack / set the iss value of an issuer instance. however, it seems that the value cannot be changed without refactoring the code. is this correct, or have i overlooked a possibility?
