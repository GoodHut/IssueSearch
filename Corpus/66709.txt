 URL : "https://github.com/ubernostrum/django-registration/issues/122" TITLE : new minor version 2.3.1 BODY : currently django registration relies on confusable_homoglyphs 2.x which is kind of broken by design regarding data files. in version 3 this is fixed and data files are redistributed with the package. i have issues with running tests on our ci for a project using django-registration if i try to upgrade from 2.2 to 2.3. in current master requirements are set to ~3.0. for that reason i'm suggesting releasing 2.3.1 if there are not any pr which are urgent and the release of 2.3.1 need to wait for tem .
