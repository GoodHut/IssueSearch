 URL : "https://github.com/ohsu-comp-bio/funnel/issues/162" TITLE : gce: improvement list BODY : now that i'm testing changes to gce and revisiting after some time, i'm noticing some pain points: - accessing server logs takes multiple, non-obvious steps. ideally, it could be as easy as funnel server logs - it's a pain adding the -s http://1.2.3.4 flag to every command. ideally, it could be stored in a per-user config file and updated via a command like funnel config set server-address http://1.2.3.4 or funnel connect http://1.2.3.4 or something else - failed tasks and workers are not obvious. the dashboard or something should clearly report the issue - ideally, deploying funnel to a google cloud project is as easy as funnel deploy google-cloud . - currently, during deployment you're required to activate autoscaling by creating instance templates. this is too much. there should at least be a set of reasonable default templates built into funnel, with options for adding custom templates and disabling default templates.
