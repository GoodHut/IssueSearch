 URL : "https://github.com/shagu/pfUI/issues/769" TITLE : right chat issue BODY : last night when i downloaded the addon, i went into settings and began customizing it. after killing some mobs, i noticed i wasn't getting information in my right chat log regarding profession skill-ups, gathered loot, reputation gains, etc. things that were found in the default vanilla chat log. i've tried searching through the settings for the solution but couldn't find out where the issue was.
