 URL : "https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/issues/14367" TITLE : automatic core updates BODY : could you please add the ability to perform core automatic updates to joomla. wordpress has this feature and it's something i feel would be beneficial to add to the cms itself. i know there are drawbacks to it but having the option would be nice, i've never personally had any issues with updated breaking my website or third party plugins in the last 3 years.
