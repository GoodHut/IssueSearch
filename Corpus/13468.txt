 URL : "https://github.com/Morwenn/cpp-sort/issues/112" TITLE : upgrade to c++20 BODY : the first c++20 features might start to appear as soon as the end of the toronto standard committee meeting in a few days. i'm creating this issue to make sure that i can track the smaller things that may make it into the standard and provide potential improvements to cpp-sort as they get incorporated into the standard draft. i'm a bit early, but there will probably be fun times ahead.
