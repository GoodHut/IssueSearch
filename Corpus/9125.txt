 URL : "https://github.com/cloudcreativity/laravel-json-api/issues/60" TITLE : the path to 1.0 BODY : now that neomerx/json-api is at 1.0 we want to get this library to 1.0 as soon as possible - to give people confidence that the api is stable. the recent routing refactor and reducing the number of units per resource type currently on develop - will be released as 0.8 puts in a lot of pre-1.0 changes that we wanted to do to simplify the package. required 1.0 features - full support for filtering, paging etc for relationship endpoints - including test helpers. see 22, 23, 27 - hydrate eloquent polymorphic relationships. see 35 - generic authorizer that hands off to laravel policies. see 45 - refactor jsonapicontroller so that it has the majority of the workflow that currently exists within eloquentcontroller . extend the eloquent controller from this new controller. - add a broadcast helper trait. see 36 - add a blade template helper to encode json api data into a html page. see 36 - drop support for laravel 5.3 and ensure support for 5.4 and 5.5 at 1.0. - unit tests in this package rather than relying on the demo app to test package is working. required internal changes - rename the resource class as it is a reserved word in php 7.0 - extract standardobjectinterface and related generic classes to a separate utility library. - single validatorerrorfactoryinterface in the cloudcreativity/json-api package rather than extending that interface in laravel-json-api . - ideally stop injecting httpserviceinterface and instead inject the apiinterface and requestinterface directly. this is possible as long as no services are created post the json-api middleware running. opening this issue so that people can comment on any features that they think are needed for 1.0.
