 URL : "https://github.com/rnosov/react-reveal/issues/5" TITLE : 0.3.1 breaking changes? BODY : were there breaking changes between 0.3.0 and 0.3.1? i upgraded to 0.4 today, and my components that include react-reveal will no longer run. i tried downgrading to 0.3.0 and it worked, but 0.3.1 and later give me the same result: bundle.js:5732 warning: react.createelement: type is invalid -- expected a string for built-in components or a class/function for composite components but got: object. check the render method of home . the home component in this instance runs just fine if i remove any reveal instances, which are built according to the docs: <reveal ssr classname= row effect= animated fadeinup ></reveal>
