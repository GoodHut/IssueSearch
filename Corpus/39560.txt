 URL : "https://github.com/datproject/dat/issues/796" TITLE : single file download BODY : having single file download would be cool. a couple options: 1. dat download <key>/file.txt , dat <key>/file.txt - download file with in memory metadata 2. dat clone <key>/file.txt - download file with sparse state the first would be easier and can be implemented now. second requires some sparse state tracker. this is because if you have a .dat folder and run dat sync it will try to download the whole dat by default, even if you only cloned a single file. we need some way to track: 1. if a dat was initialized in sparse mode 2. what files have been requested for download this should probably happen in dat-node, since desktop would have the same issue of sparse downloads ending up with the whole dat.
