 URL : "https://github.com/powerlord/sourcemod-mapchooser-extended/issues/7" TITLE : request mapcycle choosing BODY : i originally had made an attempt to expand this plugin to support voting for a mapcycle file before voting for a map, which would also cause a config to execute when a map in that cycle is loaded... but i ran into problems because i didn't know too much about the keyvalues parser. i had written a syntax for this file, called mce_mapcycles.cfg. mapcycles { mapcycle.txt { name deathmatch cfg config_deathmatch.cfg } mg_mapcycle.txt { name minigame cfg config_minigame.cfg } ctf_mapcycle.txt { name capture the flag cfg config_ctf.cfg } } the idea for this was to allow a cleaner implementation of what ultimate mapchooser could pull off, allowing one to select map cycles, and execute configs specialized for those cycles.
