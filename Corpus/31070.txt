 URL : "https://github.com/oliviergimenez/GammaGompertzCR/issues/2" TITLE : review for joss 1/n BODY : overall, i think this package is fine clear and, as far as i can see, technically correct . there are a handful of changes that need to be made to conform to joss's standards, but those should be relatively easy. on the other hand, there are a rather large number of chores, individually not too big deal but overall perhaps rather overwhelming, that could be made to make this package much easier to use and enhance its uptake in the research community.
