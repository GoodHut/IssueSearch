 URL : "https://github.com/jaywink/socialhome/issues/162" TITLE : remove content modal BODY : it was a nice experiment but it works badly and is a nuisance to maintain without actually having much benefit. kill it with fire. the content link could take directly to a single content view. on option would also be to enlarge the content item in the stream to for example double columns on click. ideally both these could be possible.
