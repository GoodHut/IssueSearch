 URL : "https://github.com/jython/devguide/issues/2" TITLE : delete the faq BODY : the frequently asked questions in the cpython devguide were redistributed to the sections of the guide that deal with the subject of the question, under the pr to delete the faq https://github.com/python/devguide/issues/27 . we have restored the faq in our fork because we had some answers specific to jython and mercurial to give. actually, i'm a bit ahead of myself. this will be accurate when we merge 1. it took cpython a while, and multiple prs, to find homes for everything. getting rid of things cpython already moved which are now duplicative in ours would be an easy start.
