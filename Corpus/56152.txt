 URL : "https://github.com/pulibrary/figgy/issues/579" TITLE : migrate dulles papers? BODY : we ingested ~9000 items from the dulles papers collection https://plum.princeton.edu/catalog?f%5bmember_of_collections_ssim%5d%5b%5d=john+foster+dulles+papers&locale=en , but afaik, never progressed any further in using them in any other application. should we migrate that collection to figgy, or should we revisit that collection and integration with pulfa when we're ready to pursue that?
