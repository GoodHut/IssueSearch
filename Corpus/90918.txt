 URL : "https://github.com/projectatomic/rpm-ostree/issues/669" TITLE : support /tmp as directory BODY : i think we should at least have an option to make /tmp a regular directory. my original theory was one doesn't want space leaking between osnames. but in fact... /var/tmp already leaks in that sense. the current negatives are: - /tmp -> /sysroot/tmp has broken systemd's tmp.mount for a long time now - it's hard to make work right if one wants to run a container tool reusing the atomic host rootfs this can be mostly sidestepped by recreating the / and just using /usr for example as we do for our internal bwrap usage, but still.
