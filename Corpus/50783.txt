 URL : "https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-html5/issues/240" TITLE : add a performance test BODY : there seem to be many different routes to optimize the current code base, for increased read speed and render speed. a benchmarking test that produces some clear number will help in evaluate proposed changes. this maybe complicated to produce but two values would be ideally returned by such a test- 1. total time to read all assets on an article request. this would include lookup content in zim, decompression time 2. total time to render the page with all its assets. this is time it takes to inject all assets into ui. total load time would be the sum of these two. i have been manually trying to do this using the chrome debugger by running a request on en wikipedia's paris page, which produces some 200 asset odd asset reads and takes 30-40s to complete with the jquery method. seems like an ideal target to optimize. but the numbers keep varying a lot randomly so some kind automation might be required. the basic idea being gain\loss from change = test old code - test new code and some way to keep track of this number from build to build.
