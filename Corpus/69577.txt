 URL : "https://github.com/linuxdeepin/dde-file-manager/issues/76" TITLE : the trash to be smarter BODY : see that the real service of the trash is to prevent accidental deletions, and nothing else. treating it as a second stock for files, as most desktops do, provide no service at all. the current design forces to have a trash icon in the dock, so the user can notice if there are files to delete. but that does nothing to the user, and only makes him in charge of keeping the trash clean. it would be nicer if the trash deleted by default files older than a day, in the dock the trash was treated as a plugin, and the plugin was disabled by default.
