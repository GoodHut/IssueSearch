 URL : "https://github.com/pydata/xarray/issues/1603" TITLE : future of multiindex BODY : i think we can continue the discussion we have in 1426 about multiindex here. in comment https://github.com/pydata/xarray/pull/1426 issuecomment-304778433 , @shoyer recommended to remove multiindex from public api. i agree with this, as long as my codes work with this improvement. i think if we could have a list of possible multiindex use cases here, it would be easier to deeply discuss and arrive at a consensus of the future api.
