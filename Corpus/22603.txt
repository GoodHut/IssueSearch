 URL : "https://github.com/akcjademokracja/nwww/issues/1" TITLE : main campaign page BODY : changes to implementation on the main campaign page: - add customized call-to-action button - in sidebar display only campaigns counters with title, without picture, make that look pretty - list of linked actions and news in bottom should be aligned to top of every row.. maybe default pictures for items without pictures is good idea? avoid white spaces with no sense.
