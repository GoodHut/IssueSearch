 URL : "https://github.com/ciena-frost/ember-frost-viz/issues/28" TITLE : can't label axes BODY : @srowhani wanted to add an axis label, which sounds reasonable, right? the scale component is purely concerned with ticks and labels. there should be a wrapping component called an axis. usage: replace hbs {{frost-viz/scale transform databindings.y. 0 align= left ticks=10 ticklabelformat= frost-viz/format/numeric }} with hbs {{frost-viz/axis transform label= altitude as |axis|}} {{frost-viz/scale axis databindings.y. 0 align= left ticks=10 ticklabelformat= frost-viz/format/numeric }} {{/frost-viz-axis}} wherever you need axis labels, which is, like, everywhere. rough sketch: mixes in svgaffinetransformable, so it's positionable by its parent like a scale is mixes in dombox, so it can be styled with css mixes in area, so it has a child area mixes in scopeprovider, so it can yield a scope accepts scope as positional parameter accepts align as parameter accepts label text as parameter accepts component name of label renderer, defaulting to a simple svg text renderer accepts scale component as block has computed property, labelelement computes label position based on align and padding e.g. align=left: label rect is area.left, area.top to innerarea.left, area.bottom template renders the label using {{ component labelcomponentrenderer }} template yields to scope component
