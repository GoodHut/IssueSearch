 URL : "https://github.com/django-danceschool/django-danceschool/issues/61" TITLE : add some new stats charts BODY : it seems like it would be helpful to keep track of: - what percentage of the time the people who register are registering for more than one class at a time. this would be insightful for understanding what kinds of multi-class discounts to offer - how far in advance people register on average. now that the discount system does time-based discounts, it would be useful to know this information. - what percentage of registrations receive some kind of discount maybe broken out by category , and on average how large is the discount they receive - what percentage of registrations use a voucher code, and on average how much are they used for - the most commonly used discount codes - the most commonly used voucher codes for schools that use publicly advertised voucher code as discounts these aren't super high priority items, but they seem potentially very useful. if anyone else wants to take a stab at creating them, i'd love to hand this off.
