 URL : "https://github.com/telerik/kendo-angular/issues/675" TITLE : group layout click problem BODY : hey guys, the x that is supposed to remove the group from the grouping toolbar is not working consistently. sometimes it removes the grouping but sometimes it does not - it initiates drag reorder , sometimes this can get fixed by reload of the page but sometimes it cannot. i cannot reproduce this consistently so here are 2 gif examples one is our implementation, the other is one of the grouping examples from the docs ! frph6hruh0 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/323925/27381762-b71dffdc-568c-11e7-8c3c-7213ffa003cd.gif ! wmxguonnvm https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/323925/27381764-b9aa6c86-568c-11e7-8c76-a3b85edfe3c1.gif nothing is logged in the console.
