 URL : "https://github.com/glandium/vmfs-tools/issues/21" TITLE : vmfs 6 support? BODY : update request not a bug : will vmfs 6 be supported in the future or maybe it is already, and i just can't find it in the release notes ? i was using clonezilla to replicate a esxi 6.5 install with vms and the datastore just won't mount when i restore the image; the vsphere web client freezes when i try to do in manually and throws unexpected error message. if there is interest, i'll dig around for any relevant log files. thanks!
