 URL : "https://github.com/openantz/antz/issues/256" TITLE : weird translate behavior BODY : i can't believe i never noticed this before. when i lock the translate parameter to a specific axis by hitting the x key and then click and drag a branch level 0 object, the movement is locked in the translate_x direction of the camera, not the world. this is non-intuitive. in order for me to move objects locked to a specific world direction i am forced to use the keyboard function keys which can sometimes be non-optimal, but obviously this has not been a huge problem. i recall observing it a long time ago and not being sure what was going on but never pursued it. it's probably a low priority in the grand scheme of things.
