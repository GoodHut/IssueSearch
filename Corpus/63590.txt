 URL : "https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/6620" TITLE : endianness of ext types BODY : the api docs say that buffer, window and tabpage types can be interchanged with integers. my initial experiments discovered them encoded in msgpack ext objects as single bytes, but can they ever be more than one byte, and if so, are there any guarantees about their endianness? and should they be treated as unsigned or signed?
