 URL : "https://github.com/mafintosh/a-native-example/issues/1" TITLE : why not n-api? BODY : would be great to see example with n-api https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html which should just work without rebuilding on different major versions of node.js . abi-stable-node https://github.com/nodejs/abi-stable-node and node-addon-api https://github.com/nodejs/node-addon-api can be used to support versions older then 8.0.0 . anyways thank you for such a simple example of using native node modules : .
