 URL : "https://github.com/meraki/provisioning-lib/issues/6" TITLE : enable vlans on mx BODY : i don't see in the list of functions in merakiapi.py where you can enable vlans on an mx. i tested creating a network, and adding/updating mxip and vlan ips once vlans were enabled on the network mx . but once you create the network, you have to manually go into the dashboard, enable vlans, and then go back to your script to make any changes. am i missing something?
