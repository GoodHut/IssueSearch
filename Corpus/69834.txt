 URL : "https://github.com/zealdocs/zeal/issues/741" TITLE : ui problems under unity BODY : hi, i've just switched to unity and after setting up zeal the way i used to use it minimize to status bar or window close, hot key, and start minimized i can't restore the window any more. the app just sits in the status bar, hot key doesn't work and the only item in the context menu is 'quit'. so no way to use it. even exiting and restarting won't work because it starts minimized... the problem is that the shortcut i picked meta+shift+space wouldn't work neither alt+shift+space does and the context menu misses a restore option. so i had to edit the config file manually. another problem is that after closing and restoring the window, the window menu does not appear any more. even if the app is focused, the menu is not revealed when hovering the title bar, however underlying window will show its menu when hovering that. while zeal still has the focus. weird.
