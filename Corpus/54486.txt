 URL : "https://github.com/reflex-frp/reflex-dom-contrib/issues/39" TITLE : get rid of default.nix BODY : the current default.nix is out of date as far as i can tell and it's unlikely to be easy to fix that. with nixpkgs.callcabal2nix and reflex-platform.cabal2nixresult , it's not difficult to generate the correct default.nix automatically as part of a larger nix derivation. this will always be more reliable. should we just delete the file?
