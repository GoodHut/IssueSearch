 URL : "https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura/issues/2068" TITLE : ui layout issues BODY : i've been having problems for a while now where the ui isn't sized/aligned properly. i am running 2.6.1 and had the same problem in 2.6. a good example of it is this: ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1454872/27839287-222b21e8-60be-11e7-8929-47f9df2ee808.png when clicking on anything in the ui, i have to click much lower than the actual control. it happened when i plugged one of my monitors into the internal graphics card rather than my nvidia card but doesn't matter what monitor i use the app in. cura 2.6.1 windows 10 pro x64 kaby lake cpu w/ hd 630 graphics using this is when it happened 2x nvidia gtx 1070 2560x1400 monitor resolution i made a gif of the interaction here http://i.imgur.com/ceobwl4.gifv , you can see i have to click lower than where expected and i get a lot of inaccurate clicks unless i move in just the right spot. i have found waiting to see the blue highlight is the only way to effectively do anything accurately.
