 URL : "https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/8170" TITLE : 3d arrow plot BODY : bug report no 3d version of arrow plot - although in a 2d plot, it's possible to do plt.arrow the 3d equivalent has yet to been implemented. i'm going to try and implement a 3d version of the arrow plot based off this code http://stackoverflow.com/a/22867877/1079075 and would like some guidance. 1. should i modify matplotlib/lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py to include this new function or should it go somewhere else? 2. is the signature def arrow self, x, y, z, dx, dy, dz, kwargs : to match the 2d version of def arrow self, x, y, dx, dy, kwargs : acceptable?
