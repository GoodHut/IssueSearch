 URL : "https://github.com/gregeryb/jaxBullet/issues/1" TITLE : add gimpact routines BODY : just found this repository. i have been interested in the java version of bullet for a while. if you don't mind i have a number of questions: why did you make this port? how does this port differ from the jezek port or the enhanced port known as jmbullet? do you have any plans to convert the gimpact code? would the existing gimpact code from jmbullet work with your port? thanks. jim
