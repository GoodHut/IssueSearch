 URL : "https://github.com/manuzhang/read-it-now/issues/18" TITLE : minimal scala testing BODY : monix author alexandru nedelcu disagrees design choices of most popular testing libraries like specs2 https://etorreborre.github.io/specs2/ and scalatest http://www.scalatest.org/ and has made his own minitest https://github.com/monix/minitest . those libraries have a dsl mimicking human language, e.g. x shouldbe greaterthan y , which can be simply done as assert x > y . > another thing that i absolutely hate are tests marked with english words like it , forcing you to phrase the test's description in a certain way. i frequently end up with sentences that makes no sense yeah, i spend a lot of time correcting my phrases and others' when using scalatest. minitest has a minimal implementation around sbt http://www.scala-sbt.org/ interface and integration with scalacheck https://www.scalacheck.org/ . with similar complaints, li haoyi has built utest https://github.com/lihaoyi/utest , containing just the features necessary to test codes. for example, it provides nice error messages without redundant matchers. minitest and utest are two alternatives if you get tired of the wordy specs2 and scalatest. references 1. minitest: zero crap scala testing library https://alexn.org/blog/2017/11/10/minitest-no-crap-scala-library.html 2. utest: the essential test framework for scala http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/utesttheessentialtestframeworkforscala.html
