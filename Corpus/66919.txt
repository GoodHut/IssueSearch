 URL : "https://github.com/TechReborn/StevesCarts/issues/84" TITLE : note sequencer gui bug? BODY : the note sequencer works fine for ~107 notes, you can use the scroll bar to scroll along and look at them. if you add any notes past that number for any track, only the furthest left position of the scroll bar displays any notes, the rest are blank. i've tried different gui sizes and screen resolutions, but the issue is the same.
