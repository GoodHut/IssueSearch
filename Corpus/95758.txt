 URL : "https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/926" TITLE : discussion: mapped methods BODY : take the following class public static class c { private static int _c = 0; // i want this to be a map public static int m int x, int y { return x+y; } public static void m2 { _c = 7; } } i want m to be a map. that is, if called with inputs x and y then the output will only depend on x and y. however, someone might come along and change m to be: public static int m int x, int y { return x+y+_c; } this still works technically if _c is 0, but if they ever call m2 , the mapping of m is broken. so i would like this to raise a warning or error. i'd like a way, if this possible or even makes sense, to mark a method as a map. either with a keyword, something like public static map int m int x, int y { .. } or maybe an attribute, something like map public static map int m int x, int y it would then be a compiler warning to change m in such a way that it's output is dependent on anything other than it's inputs in this case x and y . does this make sense? is it feasible?
