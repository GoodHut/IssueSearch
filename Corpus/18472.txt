 URL : "https://github.com/overturetool/vdm2c/issues/86" TITLE : test system issue BODY : i noticed that if you set up a junit test that tries to code-generate a model that is not type-correct then the test still passes. obviously that's not ideal since the current test system relies on models being type-correct. instead the test should fail when the model has parse/type errors. this problem happens because the test system invokes the command-line interface cli directly the main method , which only report parse/type errors and other problems via the standard output stream. currently, the test system ignores the cli output, which is what is causing the problem. a better approach is probably to use the parse/typechecker/vdm2c facade classes to translate the model into c code. this will make it easier to detect any issues with the model or vdm2c.
