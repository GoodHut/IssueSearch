 URL : "https://github.com/giakki/uncss/issues/327" TITLE : uncss with modernizr BODY : when using modernizr it would be useful to specify a list of checks so that uncss can slice that part of the style declaration before performing its check for existence. ie. html <html class= no-js no-csscalc lang= en > or <html class= no-js csscalc lang= en > sass .no-csscalc .myclass{ width: 100%; } .csscalc .myclass{ width: calc 100% - 10px ; } with the current implementation both of these would be removed as no-csscalc/csscalc isn't on the html tag on page load its added through js, even if it was i'd want both scenario's css keeping. i know i could add myclass to the ignored list, but that quickly becomes tiresome and a manual process when you have lots of checks and lots of classes. i could add no-csscalc and csscalc to the ignores but if i have 100 classes all surrounded in a modernizr class then there essentially no longer being processed they'll just all get bundled in even if they don't appear in the html. a solution could be a new property modernizr : csscalc and in the uncss process you could strip the normal and no- version from css before performing the check. so .csscalc .myclass and .no-csscalc .myclass would become .myclass and that would be looked for inside the html? any thoughts?
