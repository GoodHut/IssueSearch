 URL : "https://github.com/steemit/steem/issues/1550" TITLE : remove olf config options BODY : appbase prefixes config options based on the plugin they belong to. in order to maintain backwards compatibility with existing configs, we have duplicate options with both the new and the old name. in 0.20.x we will remove the old config options. 0.20.x was chosen because many node operators will not upgrade to 0.19.x so we will still have a large amount of migration in 0.20.0
