 URL : "https://github.com/wisnia007/prj-rev-bwfs-dasmoto/issues/4" TITLE : summary - satisfactory BODY : great job putting this project together. it shows that you did a lot of work on this and you are making good progress so far. you were able to style the page successfully and had no problems making the page look like the example. there were a couple of improvements that you can make that i outlined in the issues section. nothing major, just make sure you make it a habit to keep consistent spacing throughout your css to make it easy to read. as a challenge, i'd try to come back to this project when you learn more about media queries and responsive design and make it mobile friendly. take care!
