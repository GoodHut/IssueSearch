BODY : i just started a new room, at level 2 it started spawning ranger-def creeps which left the room and into a centre room and died to a source keeper. this carried on until the colony was dead. this is similar to what happened with the enemy room which i think we fixed. after 300 ticks, the first spawn was another ranger-def : i've took out defence task until it spawns a worker again. but i don't think defenders should ever spawn for centre rooms or sk's. p.s. is there a command to clear spawn queues?
