BODY : hi : first of all, thank you for fixing the component! awesome component. :d but there is a slight problem. i am using stereo images and the component does not work with images. if i pull up two spheres and put images on both, i get both in either eye. if i change the asset type to video, the spheres get seperated correctly for both eyes and ofc just black spheres^^ . is it possible to get images working too? : cheers, max
