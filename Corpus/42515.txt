 URL : "https://github.com/EnMasseProject/routilities/issues/11" TITLE : blank page on console BODY : i'm getting a blank page when accessing the console with the latest image. see developer console debug http://people.redhat.com/~ulilleen/console_error.png . it works with the 0.8.0 release, so i suspect that one of the changes in https://github.com/enmasseproject/routilities/pull/9 is causing this since these are the only commits after the release.
