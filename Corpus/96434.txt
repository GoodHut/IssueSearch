 URL : "https://github.com/ian-james/IFS/issues/91" TITLE : ethics review student work BODY : student submissions are currently retained with indirect connections to the original user. do these submissions hold any longer term value. the potential that students include their name in a make file or at the top of a file makes anoymizing this more difficult and perhaps we should delete their work and also save ourselves tons of space.
