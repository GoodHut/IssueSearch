 URL : "https://github.com/GAMPTeam/vampyre/issues/4" TITLE : travis ci integration BODY : it would be nice to go ahead and integrate the project into travis ci. there isn't a huge need at the moment, but it would be nice to already have the configuration completed so we can keep up with the build status and test code coverage as we go forward. i'm mostly leaving this as a personal to-do, it should take about 20 minutes or less to configure.
