 URL : "https://github.com/IsraelHikingMap/Map/issues/189" TITLE : galileo offline maps BODY : copy from https://github.com/israelhikingmap/site/issues/584 opened by @gillss feature sqlitedb for galileo offline maps what i expect to happen your site has great support for android users, but we ios people feel neglected. can you please add sqlitedb file for galileo in the download area? mobac and sasplanet get a lot of errors trying to download tiles especially on zoom 16 it would be especially nice, if we could be able to download a file you built for us i believe preparing such a file will reduce the need for massive downloads from the site. thank you in advance for making the ios people more happy gill
