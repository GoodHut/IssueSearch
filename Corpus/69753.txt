 URL : "https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/osf.io/issues/7877" TITLE : trouble getting started BODY : hello all, i'm interested in developing some new modules, but i'm new to the project and having difficulty launching everything for the first time. i'm still a bit green wrt docker, django, and the rest, so please forgive any n00b questions. i'm having basically the same problems in mac and ubuntu. i'm able to launch all containers, following the readme as closely as i can, but they can't communicate and initial migrations fail. error logs are very long. it also took me a while to realize that cloning the repo left out the .docker-compose.env files. so what i'm looking for is a clearer, more up-to-date set of instructions. here are a couple hurdles i'm stuck on: 1 my docker is set up to host a 172.x.x.x network. should this actually be 192.168.168.x? i've tested both, but the inability for containers to communicate seems to persist in either case. 2 item 2 under application runtime includes 'tokumx', which isn't in any of the docker-compose.yml files, but mongo is. i tried substituting 'mongo' but i still can't get it to work. i love this project - i couldn't hardly sleep last night, wanting to get it to actually work locally. thanks in advance, dan
