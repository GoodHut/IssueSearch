 URL : "https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/Flask-SocketIO/issues/456" TITLE : best performant option BODY : hey miguel, how's it going! i'm starting a new project and i'm trying to decide more intelligently between gevent and eventlet. this particular project has to be windows-friendly. in the docs, you state that > eventlet is the best performant option but this stackoverflow post http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12669971/what-does-make-significant-difference-of-performance-between-eventlet-and-gevent seems to indicate that gevent is more performant in general. i would obviously prefer whichever is most performant, assuming it works on windows. eventlet is also appealing since it only requires the one library and has websocket support built in.
