 URL : "https://github.com/y0ssar1an/CSS3/issues/84" TITLE : porting to vscode / atom BODY : hey, i'm working on a vscode vue plugin and since many vue users use postcss, i've included a postcss grammar to support it. grammar is taken from here: https://github.com/azat-io/atom-language-postcss however, that definition is far more incomplete compared to yours. great work! i'm wondering if it's possible to modify css3 grammar to drop sublime specific syntax and make it available to vscode / atom users. i've written some tm grammar so i can help. but i'd like to know if it's just a lot of work or it's downright impossible to modify and a rewrite is necessary. thanks!
