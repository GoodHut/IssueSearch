 URL : "https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/issues/3413" TITLE : exploit via map screen BODY : when player lands on a planet, some missions initiate conversations which end with a launch , or there are missions offered. currently, pressing m lets player to see the destination which is a good thing . the problem is, that map also lets player to take on missions. if conversation was a mission, player can end up with negative remaining cargo space. if conversation was to end with a launch to prevent doing anything while landed, well, it fails at it.
