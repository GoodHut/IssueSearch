 URL : "https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/2955" TITLE : improve release process BODY : inspired by 2954. should we make yarn build error or something if it sees that the version in package.json hasn't changed? if so, we also need to add a way to force building anyway, since it is useful for testing. @suchipi @azz you've released versions before. is there anything else we could improve? would be nice to be able to chunk of patch releases super quickly.
