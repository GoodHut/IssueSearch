 URL : "https://github.com/HTSTEM/MusicBot/issues/11" TITLE : better queue system..? BODY : the current queue system is perfectly fine... if we let people queue only one song at a time. however, i realized i don't like this approach very much after i used services like dubtrack https://dubtrack.com , and checked out jagrosh's musicbot https://github.com/jagrosh/musicbot . both essentially let you have your own personal queue maybe even your own personal auto playlist? that's a separate request entirely tho which you can add songs to at any time. one will then get sent into the bot's song queue, and once the song is played, the next song is added. this is done until the user's personal queue is empty, or they run a command to pause their personal queue which would also remove their current song from the global queue . if this is implemented, personal user queues shouldn't be cleared when disconnecting from a voice channel or when the bot restarts. this would obviously depend on 10 but i don't see that being a big issue as that sounds like a much easier and higher priority task to accomplish...
