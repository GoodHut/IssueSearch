 URL : "https://github.com/Jungyubw/newTCAMT/issues/161" TITLE : exported profile id issues BODY : i imported some xml profile, created test plan and then exported the profile files. each<message> element has its id attribute changed which is totally fine . the issue is that the id was not changed in the constraint file. i still see things like <byid id= oru_r01:lri_ng_fru >, where the id value was the value from my original file and does not exist anymore in the exported profile
