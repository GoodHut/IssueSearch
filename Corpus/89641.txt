 URL : "https://github.com/openshmem-org/specification/issues/108" TITLE : realloc of aligned memory BODY : what, if any, alignment requirements are there in a call to shmem_realloc when the input buffer was allocated using shmem_align ? the posix_memalign function has the following caveat, should shmem also have it? > memory that is allocated via posix_memalign can be used as an argument in subsequent calls to realloc 3 , reallocf 3 , and free 3 . note however, that the allocation returned by realloc 3 or reallocf 3 is not guaranteed to preserve the original alignment .
