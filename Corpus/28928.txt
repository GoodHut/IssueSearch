 URL : "https://github.com/a-slide/pycoQC/issues/4" TITLE : import sys addition BODY : i know this is a tutorial, and you are using a dataset designed for the tutorial, but it may be worth including a section in the workflow about using a real dataset. it is an easy addition and i know these manuals are often designed for people who understand the code but it may be useful for people who aren't great at coding to include a portion in the readme: after: from pycoqc.pycoqc import jprint as print import sys example_file_1d = '/path/to/real/sequencing/sequencing_summary.txt' print example_file_1d /path/to/real/sequencing/sequencing_summary.txt then all analysis following this portion will point to real data rather than your preloaded set. i only say this because i have had this installed in my work's cluster and i have had several people ask me why they always get the same output for the data. i then refer them to this or meet with them to show them but it makes it more inclusive. thanks
