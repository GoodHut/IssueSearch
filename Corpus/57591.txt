 URL : "https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/issues/133" TITLE : ranking fraud possible BODY : based on some testing, i've determined that it is possible to defraud yacy's ranking algorithm. i have proof-of-concept exploit code which i've nicknamed yacybomb that implements the fraud. the yacy project doesn't list any preferred way to report security bugs which this may qualify as ; can you please advise me on how to proceed on responsibly disclosing the fraud bug to the yacy developers?
