 URL : "https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots/issues/338" TITLE : rootston segfault on exit BODY : no time to look at that right now, will do later but that might help me remember. i recall seeing something similar but couldn't find it in open issues. this happens on exiting with the exit shortcut, on a single rotated screen output / drm backend if that's relevant. 0x00007f839c77a3da in wl_signal_emit signal=0x138, data=0x18 at /usr/include/wayland-server-core.h:387 387 wl_list_for_each_safe l, next, &signal->listener_list, link gdb bt 0 0x00007f839c77a3da in wl_signal_emit signal=0x138, data=0x18 at /usr/include/wayland-server-core.h:387 1 0x00007f839c77b616 in wlr_output_destroy output=0x18 at ../types/wlr_output.c:384 2 0x00007f839c761bb4 in wlr_drm_backend_destroy backend=0x564d89c46fe0 at ../backend/drm/backend.c:34 3 0x00007f839c75f6fe in wlr_backend_destroy backend=0x564d89c46fe0 at ../backend/backend.c:36 4 0x00007f839c76a970 in multi_backend_destroy _backend=0x564d89c46ac0 at ../backend/multi/backend.c:35 5 0x00007f839c75f6fe in wlr_backend_destroy backend=0x564d89c46ac0 at ../backend/backend.c:36 6 0x0000564d89901d08 in main argc=3, argv=0x7ffeedefb828 at ../rootston/main.c:59
