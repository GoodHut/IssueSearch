 URL : "https://github.com/lasselehtinen/barn/issues/2" TITLE : npm & mariadb BODY : what i missed is npm for running webpack commands and or other npm commands for installation and such. it would also be good to have a mariadb package. forked your repo so shall see what i can do as well, but if you are interested in adding it and get around to it quicker than great.
