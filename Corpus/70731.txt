 URL : "https://github.com/raspberrypi/documentation/issues/710" TITLE : x86 image documentation BODY : now that we have the rpd iso on the downloads page, it would be good to be able to link to some documentation on how to use it. i propose: - how to write the image to a cd/dvd/usb stick - how to boot from a live disc - how to install it on a pc - how to boot it in a vm i'd be happy to write the vm tutorial, and i know we've had magpi articles on writing to a usb stick, but we should place them in here and keep them up-to-date. i haven't seen any tutorials on how to install it for good - i know there are some new options on boot in the more recent image, and these good do with explaining too. any volunteers?
