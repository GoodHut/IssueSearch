 URL : "https://github.com/alexpdraper/reading-list/issues/49" TITLE : allow to add links BODY : can you please allow adding links to the list without opening them first? i could imagine a shift+click or a ctrl+click. also there could be a key-board-shortcut, to change the mouse-cursor into a crosshair if pointing to a link. as a safe but lame way, there could also be a right-click-menu-entry.
