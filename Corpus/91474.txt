 URL : "https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/issues/562" TITLE : training on larger images BODY : hi, my video input is 1800x1200 and so far i've been successfully using ssd 512 by resizing the input at training and test, but was wondering if i would get better results by modifying the net, to support this resolution and avoid resizing. i realize it would make everything slower but accuracy is more important than speed in my case. any advice on wether this would affect results and pointers to required changes would be much appreciated. thanks, raviv
