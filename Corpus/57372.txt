 URL : "https://github.com/webgme/user-management-page/issues/66" TITLE : project filter options BODY : it would be nice if the project list could be quickly filtered by the user or any of the organizations she/he is a member of there is space for an extra quickfilter dropdown button... . also as the filter field in this list filters based on project name, it would be nice to highlight that for example with the change of the default name as it is not obvious. finally if the list is filtered based on some user/organization, that should be highlighted and possibly removed .
