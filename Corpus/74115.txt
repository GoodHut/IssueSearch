 URL : "https://github.com/prabindh/euclid/issues/10" TITLE : dots in image file names BODY : to detect a file extension euclid searches the dot from left to right from begin to end , so if the file has dots in names then txt file with labels has different name. example: for 'cat.in_house.jpg', euclid will create 'cat.txt' because all after the first dot is lost solution: change the direction of search of the dot from right to left from end of the name .
