 URL : "https://github.com/cs50/libcs50/issues/87" TITLE : add cmakelists.txt file BODY : i do not see a cmakelists.txt file in the code. i know it won't be possible to create a _vs solution_ due to '_attribute_' syntax error , but there is no problem creating _codeblocks project_ and _other make files_. people with minggw can easily make use of cmakelists file. i tested it on my windows machine. it works fine. i can send a pull request if needed.
