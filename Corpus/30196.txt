 URL : "https://github.com/microservices-kata/petstore-web-bff/issues/2" TITLE : obey rest principle BODY : some apis in bff are not following the principle of rest, for example, http://localhost:8090/pets/detail?id={id} which stands for a collection in rest, but has an id actually behave as a primary key which is not good to be a query param or filter . instead of this, we should use http://localhost:8090/pets/{id} .
