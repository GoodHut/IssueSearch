 URL : "https://github.com/jarvisteach/appJar/issues/235" TITLE : method naming scheme BODY : when writing classes, i try to do method names as simple as possible.. e.g. def do : return value def do_set val : value = val or when i group methods.. def main_foo : pass def main_bar : pass i noticed that appjar is using camelcase, with add/set etc at the start of method names, is there a reason for the non pep-8 usage? i'm not saying this way is wrong , i just find it harder to read. for example addlabelentry/addlabelnumericentry could be replaced with entry and numeric_entry , to get values you could just simply use entry_get which for me is a lot easier to read and avoids camels. all this of course is a matter of personal taste.
