 URL : "https://github.com/gobuffalo/buffalo/issues/606" TITLE : .env files support BODY : as now envy supports loading .env files https://github.com/gobuffalo/envy/pull/3 , i'd like to add buffalo the capability to automatically load them. a great way of integrating it to buffalo would be allowing env overriding by go_env: common env settings that won't vary across environments: .env environment dependant settings ie: smtp_user : .env.development , .env.production , .env.test that is: .env file will always be loaded, but also .env.<environment> if it exists. the latter will be able to override any values that are needed if a user wants it . i was thinking about putting it on buffalo.automatic , as buffalo.new allows for complete custom tailor made apps, and not every user that decides to go that path may want .env file support. i also thought about putting it in optionswithdefaults , but as it's called also in buffalo.new i don't know if it would be appropriate. as i mentioned on the envy repo, take into account that globally initialized vars won't be affected by this, as the resolution of the value would be made at the start of the program, and that would imply that the env files have not been loaded yet. this could affect to variables like this: go const port = envy.get port , 8080 as this kind of values are resolved before any other call has been made including the envy.reload one . but this cannot be solved by any means with any library, as it's a language behaviour. before starting to code it, i'd like for the proposal to be commented and approved.
