 URL : "https://github.com/artem-zinnatullin/TheContext-Podcast/issues/67" TITLE : volume is too low BODY : when i listen to podcasts i can use the same volume for all my podcasts except this one, where i have to almost max out the volume to hear properly. to be clear, this is more related to convenience for me as opposed to an actual problem. would be happy to see it addressed though. i use pocket casts with the volume boost feature.
