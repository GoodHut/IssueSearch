 URL : "https://github.com/php-integrator/atom-base/issues/328" TITLE : base failed to install BODY : i would have added this to https://github.com/php-integrator/atom-base/issues/266 but it's locked. the wiki states that sqlite is required, but it fails to mention that pdo_sqlite rather than sqlite3 must be enabled in php.ini . i would edit the wiki myself but it doesn't appear to have the functionality. also, when an installation fails, wouldn't it be better to remove the core/x.x.x directory since further attempts to install will fail. composer complains about the directory not being empty. the above issue mentions the core directory but doesn't state its path for google users it's ~/.atom/packages/php-integrator-base/core , remove the versioned directory on a failed install .
