 URL : "https://github.com/facebook/reason/issues/1362" TITLE : camelcase or snake_case? BODY : can’t find any recommendation on this bikeshedding topic. ocaml land is snake_case and javascript is camelcase. if i’m going to make a library in reasonml which would be consumed by both js packages and other reasonml libraries how would you recommend to name api functions? 1. do everything in camelcase and you’ll get mixed style .re source files 2. do everything in snake_case and you’ll look alien when used from within js 3. use snake_case but change it to camelcase when export and you’ll get much boilerplate and two versions of docs what’s a best practice?
