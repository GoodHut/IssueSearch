 URL : "https://github.com/Elkfox/Concrete/issues/20" TITLE : duplicated logo settings BODY : we currently have duplicated settings for logos. this needs a cleanup, as does the way we define meta images like opengraph, favicon and itemprop sources. it looks like favorites_pinned_svg isn't defined yet either. i think this should take the form of settings for both a bitmap and svg image to be applied dynamically per use.
