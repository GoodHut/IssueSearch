 URL : "https://github.com/ppoffice/hexo-theme-minos/issues/32" TITLE : jquery not loading in demo BODY : in the demo preview site, jquery is not loading because of a wrong js src path. this causes the navigation drawer button to not work. current problematic version: <script src= /hexo-theme-minos//hexo-theme-minos/js/jquery.min.js ></script> while it is supposed to be: <script src= /hexo-theme-minos/js/jquery.min.js ></script> note that this does not affect any of the theme users. this bug only appears in the demo page. i would suggest you to regenerate the demo page. by the way, i am porting this theme to hugo. thanks for all the hard work. here is the repo of the port: https://github.com/carsonip/hugo-theme-minos
