 URL : "https://github.com/gracelang/grace-web-editor/issues/47" TITLE : rename of file on upload BODY : if one tries to upload into the ide a file that has the same name as one of the built-in modules, the ide warns you that this might be a bad idea. but it does _not_ give you the option of renaming the file on upload which is what it does if you try an upload a file that has the same name as one already present. could the user be offered the option of doing a rename?
