 URL : "https://github.com/CookPete/react-player/issues/263" TITLE : unable to load beta BODY : package.json: dependencies : { ... react-player : 1.0.0-beta.2 , ... code: import react from 'react'; import reactplayer from 'react-player'; ... render { return <reactplayer ... /> } i can confirm it works fine with react-player : 1.0.0-beta.1 , so there might be something wrong with the .2 release.
