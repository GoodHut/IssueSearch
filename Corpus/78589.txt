 URL : "https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Throttle/issues/53" TITLE : question cache file size BODY : i'm wondering if this package does or can take care of clearing cache garbage collect from old data old throttles automatically. i mean, since the package uses cache to store throttle's data, even if it expires, the data is still in cache files in case of using that driver , am i right? in that case, i should also use something like a garbage collector, because doesn't sounds good to be manually clearing the cache once in a while because of this package data i don't have any other use for cache actually in my app . please, correct me if i'm wrong.
