 URL : "https://github.com/opensemanticsearch/open-semantic-search/issues/43" TITLE : use external indices BODY : is it possible for opensemanticsearch to use data from external indices like xapian, nepomuk, or zeitgeist? many users already use apps like recoll, gnome tracker, or others that build their own fulltext database. it would be great if open semantic seach could include this data into its search results. especially with apps like zeitgeist that use temporal semantic aspects to group files and documents.
