 URL : "https://github.com/cwrc/HuViz/issues/100" TITLE : display dataset name BODY : ideally for both provided and local datasets. put a hold on; clarify request with susan at next meeting right now the title of a dataset appears, when it is selected from the picklist, in the command tab. ! image https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/545952/26943354-46ec9b44-4c53-11e7-94c4-be617bc6f5b8.png it would be nice if, when you load a local dataset, the string that preceeds .ttl in the filename could appear there. unless it is super easy or easier i think we should stick to this for now rather than putting the dataset in the title of the tab. in the long run i think that we might want to expand the watermark to include the file or dataset name and date as well as the huviz version number, and provide the option to darken the watermark to serve as a caption for a screenshot
