 URL : "https://github.com/MichaelErichsen/HRE--History-Research-Environment/issues/19" TITLE : lookup database tables BODY : 2 built a simple gui to create, edit and delete records in a short list of lookup tables as a separate project from the mock up and which only uses the english language . the records entered in these table are likely to be the default cases or very common cases. these tables are definition-like dependency of any another table. this may only be a list of about 10 tables that need a record editing capability at this time. these gui screens could become precursors of more elaborate screens within the hre app.
