 URL : "https://github.com/elm-community/Manifesto/issues/74" TITLE : scope of elm-community? BODY : the readme currently says elm-community is for two purposes: 1. providing a home for widely used packages that are no longer maintained https://github.com/elm-community/manifesto/blob/745ff071228b98626426f4e766af22f4c2c4983d/readme.md package-maintenance > it sometimes happens that packages which are widely used need a bit of maintenance...normally, package authors will deal with that themselves, of course, possibly with the help of pull requests from interested community members etc. however, sometimes package authors may not be available, for one reason or another, and other work can be blocked until the maintenance is performed...in those cases, elm-community can provide a home for a fork, and the necessary work to maintain the package. 2. community-driven documentation https://github.com/elm-community/manifesto/blob/745ff071228b98626426f4e766af22f4c2c4983d/readme.md community-driven-documentation > elm has great documentation, but there is always room for more, and room for documentation oriented towards particular audiences...so, this can serve as a central point for that. there have been discussions about whether the scope of elm-community should be different from this, and i'd like to centralize them here. so: 1. should the scope of elm-community be different from what the manifesto readme currently states? 2. if so, what would be the pros and cons of that different scope?
