 URL : "https://github.com/graphile/graphile.github.io/issues/13" TITLE : fix all the todo's BODY : this issue will probably never close; it's a perennial reminder that the todos in the documentation need addressing. help doing this is very welcome; you can just fix them one at a time if you like ! some things are simple check this example works - so if you can check it and it works you can delete the text and submit that as a pr üëç others are adding examples - which you'd also be very welcome to submit as a pr üëç basically what i'm trying to say is: prs welcome!
