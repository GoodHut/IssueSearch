 URL : "https://github.com/numerai/submission-criteria/issues/10" TITLE : add safety checks BODY : playing around with the server so i can get a docker image fully up and running. tried doing a post request as noted in the readme: requests.post http://localhost:5151/ , json={'submission_id': '58d411e57278611200ee49a6', 'api_key': 'h/52y/e7cm8ih4f3cvdlbm4zqxer+apk6p0l7yr0lfu='} however, kept getting an error: numerai-submission-server_1 | file /submission-criteria/database_manager.py , line 45, in update_leaderboard numerai-submission-server_1 | typeerror: 'nonetype' object is not subscriptable finally figured it out in that the server is still somewhat tied to the numerai platform in that it's expecting the submission to be in the attached mongo database. adding some safety checks with meaningful messages would help for those trying to get this running and later, to start cutting it into pieces , such as assuming that the submission may not be in the database beforehand: def update_leaderboard self, submission_id, filemanager : submission = self.db.submissions.find_one { _id :objectid submission_id } if submission is none: logging.getlogger .info unable to find submission_id {} .format submission_id no sense continuing: return depending on coding style. could return nothing, could raise an error.
