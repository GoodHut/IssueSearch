 URL : "https://github.com/alexmingoia/purescript-pux/issues/127" TITLE : broken prevent default ? BODY : hello, i was trying to send data extract from a form, using an ajax post request. i noticed that after my plugged on onsubmit event gets consumed, the default form submit goes on, reloading the page following the scenario described in https://www.w3.org/tr/html401/interact/forms.html h-17.13.3 . i thought this might be an issue with my code, so i went and run the form example provided by pux repo, but i observe the same behaviour so you can reproduce the issue easily : form submission will reload the page. i suspect, based on this comment : https://github.com/alexmingoia/purescript-pux/issues/37 issuecomment-218662255 that using ! should always prevent default behaviour. i'm using purescript 0.11.4. here are my questions : - am i wrong to assume that this is not the expected behaviour ? - if i am, what is the way to make sure submitting a form will not propagate ? - if i'm not, what's broken exactly ? thank you very much for your help !
