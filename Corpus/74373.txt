 URL : "https://github.com/jw156605/SLICER/issues/7" TITLE : error in assign_branches BODY : hello, sometimes more often than not, actually d: when running slicer as described in the readme here i get an error from the assign_branches function: <simpleerror in if mean_dist < min_dist { min_dist = mean_dist min_i = i min_j = j}: missing value where true/false needed> setting a different value for the start parameter _can_ solve the problem and return branch assignments, however it is not clear to me whether there is a pattern there. do you have a recommendation on how to proceed? everything else works smoothly, up to and including the pseudotime calculation. i am working on an 64bit ubuntu 16.04lts station, with r 3.4.1 and rstudio 1.0.143. from my sessioninfo : slicer_0.2.0 alphahull_2.1 lle_1.1 igraph_1.1.2
