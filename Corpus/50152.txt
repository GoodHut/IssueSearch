 URL : "https://github.com/bitporch/laravel-forum/issues/170" TITLE : web & api duplication BODY : currently as witnessed in 166, we will end up duplicating features for the web and api modules of the package. for every new feature we have to create 2 identical classes that will mostly differ only in the data returned by the function. to avoid this, we can do either one of the following: 1 make the web module consume the api 2 create a repository layer or whatever you want to call it that is used by both modules thoughts... ?
