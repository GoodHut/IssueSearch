 URL : "https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/Stormwater-Management-Model/issues/18" TITLE : makefile for linux BODY : it would be useful to be able to build the swmm source as an command line executable in a linux environment. a linux build will make it more convenient to run swmm on web servers; this could make it easier to scale up model runs on powerful machines on aws or whatever you prefer without having to pay for windows virtual environments. i've created a simple linux makefile that i've successfully tested on a digital ocean droplet running ubuntu 14.04. this is in my linux branch.
