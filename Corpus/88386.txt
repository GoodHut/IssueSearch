 URL : "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor/issues/429" TITLE : new space id registration BODY : hi, i defined my specific seq2seq problem using the decorator. this task is not a mt task so i need 2 new space id tokens, let's say task0_enc and task0_dec . i will use them in the same way of en or de . so my question is, how can i register a new space id that i can later retrieve using problem.spaceid ? i suppose that, if my model only takes data from this task, it doesn't matter if i use some fake tags such as en de even if the encoder doesn't actually take english data. am i right? thank you and congrats for the great work, alberto
