BODY : hey @twolfson, i'm wondering if its possible to set breakpoints in tests with this launcher. i've tried jigging electron-launcher.js to show the browser window and open dev tools and ran karma with the --debug flag, but it doesnt seem to work like the regular chrome launcher. do you have any ideas/insight that could help me? the ability to set breakpoints in these tests would be wonderful.
