BODY : hi, sorry to bother again. i'm getting a type is invalid error on the inputautocomplete component but the props i am passing seem to be consistent with what is in your example. here is my code <inputautocomplete type= text autocompletevalues={ countrylist } onchange={ this._changecountry.bind this } value={ this.state.country } /> state is set to an empty string onchange is a function autocomplete values are exported as an array like this export const countrylist = afghanistan , albania ,... not sure what the issue is. thanks!
