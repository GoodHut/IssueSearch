 URL : "https://github.com/kobble-ios/kobble-data/issues/3" TITLE : moving items issue BODY : i was moving two items links that i had dragged and dropped from one track to another. after i hit “done” i then clicked on the destination track and the files were missing when i clicked on the track to see if they were there. kobble closed after that. i reopened kobble and the link items were back in their original track. so i tried to move them again. then kobble closed again. when i reopened kobble the second time, the items were missing from both the original track and the destination track.
